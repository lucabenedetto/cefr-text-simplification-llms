Some years ago, a website warned about the risks of sharing our whereabouts online. The site said that when we post about where we are, we're not just telling friends, but also strangers who might not be nice to us. This idea fits with the growing awareness that sharing too much online can have negative consequences.
The internet has many benefits, like connecting with people all over the world and sharing our thoughts and experiences. But it also has its dangers. We might think we can say anything online without worrying about the consequences, but that's not true. Our online life is connected to our real life, and what we do online can affect our real life.
A group of people, called bloggers, were among the first to use the internet. They shared their thoughts, photos, and stories online, and some of them got into trouble. One blogger, Justin Hall, shared his life online and got into a lot of trouble. He fell in love and wrote about it on his blog, but his partner wanted him to stop. He had to choose between his blog and his relationship.
Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, shared her life online and got into trouble too. She wrote about her job, but her colleagues didn't like what she wrote. They sent her blog to her bosses, and she lost her job.
Both of these bloggers learned that what we do online can have consequences in our real life. We should be careful about what we share online and think about how it might affect others.

Some scientists were worried about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? The film combines documentary and drama to show that there's still a lot we don't understand about the universe. While it's true that scientists don't know everything, some scientists felt the need to warn people about the film, saying it was ""atrocious"" or even ""dangerous"". I watched the film and initially didn't see what all the fuss was about. Scientists were saying that new discoveries were showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. It wasn't until the film discussed some of these discoveries that I started to understand why it was so popular. For example, did you know that water molecules can be affected by our thoughts? I had heard about this before, but the film showed some interesting pictures of ice crystals changing shape depending on the mood of the person talking to them. Many people find this idea amazing, but scientists are more skeptical. They want to see more evidence before they accept it.
The film also talks about some other amazing discoveries. For example, scientists have found that the universe is made up of a type of matter that we don't understand, and it's being propelled by a mysterious force called ""dark energy"". On a smaller scale, neuroscientists have discovered that our brains can take up to half a second to process what's happening around us. Anthropologists have also found the birthplace of modern humans and how they left their home to populate the world. Finally, some scientists think they've found a link between the existence of life on Earth and the design of the universe.
Despite what some people might think, science is not complete. In fact, we're further away from knowing everything than ever before. This is because many natural phenomena can't be fully understood. The concepts of chaos and quantum uncertainty have shown us that there are limits to what we can know. Some scientists are working on a ""Theory of Everything"" that would explain all the forces and particles in the universe. For many of us, the universe is best summed up in one word: incredible."

I find writing novels challenging, but writing short stories enjoyable. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both processes complement each other and help me grow as a writer. 
When I finish a novel, I often want to write some short stories. And when I finish a group of short stories, I feel like focusing on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and never write a novel while working on short stories. This is because writing novels and short stories engage different parts of my brain.
I started writing short stories in the 1980s, after publishing two short novels. At first, it was difficult, but I enjoyed the experience and felt it helped me grow as a writer. One of my early short stories, ""Breaking Waves"", was included in my first collection of short stories, Tales from Abroad.
I like writing short stories because they don't take as long to finish as novels. It usually takes me about a week to write a decent short story. Writing a novel, on the other hand, can take a year or more. Writing short stories is a nice change of pace for me, and it allows me to be more creative. I can write about small ideas or images that come to me, and I don't have to worry about failing. If a short story doesn't turn out well, I can just move on to the next one.
Writing short stories is also a way for me to experiment and try new things, which helps me when I'm writing novels. Without short stories, I would find writing novels even more difficult. My short stories are like small, personal messages I leave behind, and it makes me happy to be able to share them with my readers.

Science is a way of understanding the world around us. It's a mix of abstract ideas and practical applications. Science has made our lives easier, but it has also raised questions about the universe and our place in it. Scientists have tried to explain the world, but their theories have changed over time. Sometimes, old ideas are replaced by new ones, and this can be a challenge.
Science is not just about discovering new things; it's also about understanding the limits of human knowledge. Scientists come from different backgrounds and have different perspectives. Sometimes, they disagree with each other, and this can lead to new discoveries.
In the past, scientists have made significant breakthroughs, such as understanding the universe and the behavior of atoms. Today, scientists are still working on understanding the universe and its secrets. Some people think that science can explain everything, but this is not always the case.
Science is not just a hobby; it's a way of shaping our future. Scientists are now able to control and manipulate the world around us, which can have both positive and negative consequences. It's important for non-scientists to understand what scientists are doing and how it affects our lives.

From 2015, big publishers started to notice that ebook sales were slowing down or even decreasing in some cases. This made them wonder if ebooks would be a successful long-term investment. Some people even thought that the hype around ebooks might have led to bad decisions, with companies losing faith in the power of physical books. Despite the evidence showing that digital and print can coexist, the idea that ebooks will 'kill' print books still sparks debate. This idea is powerful because it makes us think about our feelings towards innovation and change.
The idea of one medium replacing another is not new. Before digital technology, people predicted that radio would die when television was invented. But radio survived by finding new uses. Similarly, when the phonograph was invented, some thought it would replace books. But books are still popular today.
We have a strong emotional connection to media like books, TVs, and computers. When a new technology emerges, it can make us adjust our relationship with something we're used to. This is why we often develop a nostalgia for older technologies and products. For example, when the printing press was invented, people sought out original manuscripts. When silent movies became sound movies, people missed the older version. The same happened when we moved from vinyl records to CDs.
The idea of a medium disappearing will continue to fascinate us because it lets us think about the power of technology and our fear of change. We use familiar stories, like the story of the death of the book, to make sense of change. This story is easy to remember and share, and it shows both our excitement for the future and our fear of losing parts of our lives.

I spent almost a year and a half writing about how famous people from the past 400 years managed to find time to do their best work. I focused on the daily routines of these people, including when they slept, ate, worked, and relaxed. By looking at these small details, I hoped to give readers a new perspective on their personalities and careers.
The idea behind my book is that our daily habits can reveal a lot about who we are. As the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I shall tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat and whether you take a nap afterwards."" This book is about the daily routines of creative people, not just their final products. It's about how they organized their time to be productive and creative.
My own struggles with balancing creative work and earning a living led me to explore this topic. I wanted to know how other successful people handled the same challenges. Do you have to dedicate all your time to a project or can you set aside a small part of each day? When there's not enough time, do you have to give up something or find ways to do more in less time?
I don't claim to have all the answers, but I've collected examples of how many successful people have dealt with these challenges. I wanted to show how big ideas can be broken down into small, daily tasks. I also wanted to explore how our daily routines can affect our work and vice versa.
The title of my book is Daily Rituals, but I'm really interested in people's routines. A routine can be ordinary and unthinking, but it can also be a powerful tool for making the most of our limited time and energy. A good routine can help us stay focused and avoid procrastination.
This book was inspired by my own procrastination. One Sunday afternoon, I was supposed to write an article, but instead I spent the day tidying my office and making coffee. I realized that many other writers have similar habits, and I started researching their daily routines. This led me to create a blog and eventually this book.
I've tried to make the book easy to read and varied in its content. I've used quotes from the people I'm writing about, as well as summaries of their routines. I've also included a list of sources in the Notes section, which I hope will be helpful for readers who want to learn more."

Howard became interested in palaeontology when he was six years old. His family had to cancel their holiday to Spain due to a rise in interest rates, and instead, they went to the English coast. On the beach, Howard found an ammonite, a type of fossil. This sparked his interest in becoming a palaeontologist. He focused on the earliest periods of time, studying small, delicate creatures that lived on rocks. After completing his university studies, Howard was unsure if he would get a job. He applied for a position at Tavistock College in London, but didn't expect to get it. During the interview, the professor who was supposed to chair the panel got into an argument with his wife and was late. A different professor, who didn't like Howard's supervisor, was chosen to replace him. Despite this, Howard got the job. He was grateful, but later learned that the professor had only chosen him because of a personal feud.
Howard found that his professional life was organized and predictable, but his personal life was chaotic. One day, his briefcase containing his lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. He had to cancel his lecture and report the theft to the authorities. After a coffee break, he met a colleague who was talking to a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that had been acquired by the museum, but not yet cataloged or identified. This discovery would become his greatest challenge and ensure his professional future.

Professor Charles Spence loves to eat unusual foods, like ice cream made from bee larvae. He's a psychologist who studies how our senses work together to create the taste of food. His research helps the food industry and restaurants make their products and menus more appealing. Did you know that the person who orders first at a restaurant usually enjoys their food the most? Or that we eat more when we're with other people?
Professor Spence's lab at Oxford University is not very high-tech. He keeps costs low so he can work with chefs who can't fund their own research. He's helped big food companies make healthier products, like reducing salt and sugar. He's also worked with famous chefs to create new dishes. For example, he helped Heston Blumenthal, a well-known chef, create a dish that uses sound to enhance the flavor.
Professor Spence's research is used by many companies, including airlines and food manufacturers. He's found that certain types of music can make food taste better or worse. For example, higher-pitched music can make sweet food taste sweeter. He's also found that the shape of food can affect its taste.
At home, Professor Spence and his family have fun with food too. They have dinner parties where they experiment with different sounds and flavors. They've even had dinner parties where they used remote-controlled lights to change the mood of the meal.

Our brains are busier than ever before. We're constantly bombarded with information, some of which is true, some not. We need to sort through it all to find what's important and ignore the rest. At the same time, we're doing more things on our own. Thirty years ago, travel agents and salespeople helped us with tasks. Now we do most things ourselves. We're doing the work of several people, but we're still trying to manage our lives, families, careers, hobbies, and favourite TV shows. Our smartphones help us do all this, but they can also be a distraction. 
Many of us think we're good at multitasking, but scientists say that's an illusion. Our brains aren't good at doing multiple things at once. Instead, we quickly switch between tasks, which can be tiring and make us less efficient. Multitasking can also increase stress and make it harder to focus. 
Research shows that when we multitask, we're not as good at learning new things. We might even store new information in the wrong part of our brain. Multitasking also requires making many small decisions, which can be tiring and lead to bad decisions. 
Many experts agree that email is a big problem. It's not the email itself, but the sheer volume of messages we receive. We feel pressure to respond to every email, but it's hard to do so and get anything else done.

In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino was known for breaking up concrete at night and throwing it at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other bats that are having trouble giving birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought animals just did things, and scientists recorded what they did. They didn't think animals had feelings or moral values. But recently, scientists have started to study animal emotions. They have found that animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens have feelings. This has led to a debate: can animals be said to have consciousness? This debate has also led to a second question: do animals have a sense of right and wrong that guides their behavior? 
In an experiment, cows were given a locked gate to open to get food. The cows that opened the gate themselves seemed to be happier than those that didn't. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for the way we raise and eat them? Some scientists think we should stop eating meat, while others think we should just be more careful about how we treat animals. The main problem is that it's hard to define consciousness, so it's hard to know for sure what animals are thinking.
The article also talks about an experiment with starlings, a type of bird. The birds were kept in two different conditions: some were in big, comfortable cages, while others were in small, bare cages. The birds learned to take food from one box or another, but when they were only given bad food, only the birds in the comfortable cages would eat it. This seemed to show that being in a bad environment can make birds pessimistic. Some scientists think that animals can be depressed, just like humans."

Critical thinking is an important skill that helps us understand what we read or listen to. Adrian West, a researcher, believes that technology can both help and hinder our ability to think critically. He thinks that the amount of information available can be overwhelming and make it harder to think clearly. Additionally, he notes that just because we have a lot of data and information, it doesn't mean we have more knowledge or make better decisions.
The amount of time people spend reading has decreased, and some experts believe that this decline in reading has contributed to a decline in critical thinking. Patricia Greenfield, a psychologist, thinks that the emphasis on visual media, such as video games and television, has led to a decrease in critical thinking. She believes that reading is better for developing critical thinking skills because it requires more focus and imagination.
However, technology can also have a positive impact on critical thinking. For example, some video games and virtual worlds can help build smarter children with better reasoning skills. These games can teach decision-making and analytical skills in a fun and interactive way. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, believes that video games are not only a form of entertainment but also a valuable tool for learning.
Overall, it's clear that technology has a complex impact on our thinking and analysis. While it can be overwhelming and distracting, it can also be a valuable tool for learning and developing critical thinking skills.

Matthew Crawford is a writer and a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office, but he got bored with it. His first book was about the benefits of doing manual work. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life. He wrote it because he noticed that advertisements pop up on credit card machines when you're just entering your PIN number. He realized that these demands for our attention are getting harder to ignore.
We're constantly being asked to pay attention to things we don't really want to think about. We're being distracted from what's important. Crawford thinks that this is because we're trying to protect ourselves from being annoyed by all the interruptions. As a result, we're becoming less willing to talk to strangers or do simple things like chat with friends.
Crawford is worried about the way technology is changing the way we live. He thinks that video games, apps, and social media are making us more self-obsessed. We're spending too much time thinking about ourselves and not enough time thinking about others. We're also becoming more isolated and less willing to engage with the world around us.
Crawford thinks that the solution is to find ways to engage with the world in a more meaningful way. He suggests that we should try to focus on one thing at a time and avoid distractions. He gives the example of a cook, an ice-hockey player, and a motorbike rider, who all have to deal with the physical world and use their judgment to make decisions. He thinks that if we do this, we'll be less likely to get caught up in manufactured experiences and more likely to focus on what really matters.
This is not to say that everyone should become a chef or a professional athlete. Crawford just thinks that it's important to find ways to use our judgment and pay attention to the world around us. By doing so, we can become more focused and less distracted, and we can build stronger connections with others.

'What do you do for a living?' is a common question, and when you're a philosopher, it's a bit tricky to answer. People often think that being a philosopher means you're trying to be better than others or have some special knowledge. But this isn't true. Philosophers are just like everyone else, and we're part of the same human experience.
One reason people might think this way is that philosophers have always been known for judging and evaluating ideas. Aristotle, a famous Greek philosopher, believed that a life of contemplation was the best kind of life. Many modern philosophers wouldn't agree, but the idea still exists that philosophy is about being smart and intellectual.
Another reason for the misconception is that academic philosophy has become more focused on theory and less connected to everyday life. This means that philosophers often don't get to share their ideas with people outside of academia. As a result, philosophy can seem distant and irrelevant to many people.
I, for example, am an ethicist, which means I study ethics, or the right and wrong of human actions. However, I think this label is too narrow, as ethics is often linked to formal rules and laws. In reality, ethics is about exploring our values and attitudes towards life.
Philosophy can help us think more deeply about our daily experiences and behaviors. We might discover that our beliefs are not as clear-cut as we thought, or that we need to re-evaluate our values. By examining our ideas, we can learn more about ourselves and the world around us.

Food and eating are important topics that can bring people together and create pleasure. However, philosophers have not always given food the attention it deserves. Instead, they have often used food as a metaphor for other ideas, such as learning. Even when philosophers do talk about food, they often focus on deeper, unrelated ideas. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus believed in the importance of pleasure and avoiding pain, but his ideas were not specifically about food.
Despite this, the name Epicurus is often associated with a love of food and drink. This is because people believe that if a philosopher approves of something, it must be good. Food is a social and cultural activity that brings people together. The food we eat is shaped by our history and culture, and it is often shared with others.
Food critics, who write about food, are often seen as experts. However, this is not because they have a special talent for tasting food, but because they are good at describing what they taste. Philosophers have not given much thought to how our senses, such as taste, work.
Food can also be beautiful, like art or music. Some people think that the rise of modern cooking has given food a place in aesthetic discussions. However, food is eaten and destroyed, unlike art, which can be appreciated over time.
Food also raises important ethical questions, such as what we should eat and why. These questions reveal our values and beliefs. Philosophers will always ask why we make certain choices.
Cooking in restaurants and at home can be different. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests, while restaurant cooks have obligations to their employer and the food. Food can also bring people together across cultures, and this has been used in international diplomacy.
This text is a great example of how food can be a topic of philosophical discussion, and it is made more interesting by the use of anecdotes and examples."

Rob Daviau, an American game designer, wanted to create new and exciting board games. He thought that traditional games were not challenging enough and didn't have a storyline. He created a new version of the classic game Risk, called Risk Legacy. In this game, players' decisions had a lasting impact. They might have to tear up cards or damage the board. The game is played over several sessions, and players can see how their actions affect the game.
Daviau was asked to work on a similar game called Pandemic, a cooperative game where players work together to stop diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall, where players become sailors exploring the world. To create these games, designers have to think about all the possible choices players can make to ensure the story makes sense. They test the games with players to see how they unfold.
Daviau didn't expect his idea to be a huge success, but many people loved it. They enjoyed the new level of excitement and commitment it brought to board games. Some people compared it to video games and TV shows, where you don't play the same episode twice. The legacy format is a new way to tell stories in board games.
Pandemic's creator, Matt Leacock, thinks that designing a legacy game is like writing a novel. You need to have a plan for the beginning and the end, but also be flexible. Daviau is happy to see others take his idea and make it their own. He thinks that soon, gamers will be looking for something new and exciting.
Colby Dauch, the manager of the company that published SeaFall, thinks that the legacy format has changed the way people think about board games. He's excited to see what other designers will come up with.

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the National Aquarium in New Zealand. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a drain, which led to the ocean. This story was widely shared online and was like something out of a children's film. People enjoyed reading about the octopus's adventure and comparing it to human actions. Octopuses are very intelligent creatures, but they have bodies that are very different from ours. They can open jars, recognize faces, and even play. Some people think it's fun to imagine that animals are like us, but this can be unscientific. Dr. Frans de Waal, a scientist who studies primates, argues that it's not anthropomorphism (giving human-like qualities to animals) but rather a refusal to recognize the human-like traits of animals that is the problem. He says that animals are smarter than we give them credit for. They can think about the past and the future, show empathy, and understand what others are thinking.
In the past, people thought animals were very intelligent and could even be put on trial for crimes. In the 19th century, many naturalists believed that the difference between human and animal intelligence was one of degree, not kind. Charles Darwin, the famous scientist who developed the theory of evolution, also believed this. However, in the 20th century, the behaviorist movement emphasized conditioning animals through rewards and punishments, and this changed how people viewed animal intelligence. For a long time, animals were seen as either machines that responded to stimuli or as robots with useful instincts. Anyone who thought animals had internal lives was seen as romantic or unscientific.
Now, Dr. de Waal believes that we are starting to change our views on animal intelligence. We are learning to think of animal cognition as being on the same spectrum as human cognition, although not necessarily at the same level. The most effective tests of animal intelligence are those that take into account the animal's specific traits and skills. For example, squirrels may not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they hid their food. Dr. de Waal is skeptical about Inky's escape story, but he recognizes the power of viral stories to raise awareness about animal intelligence."

'Robots are becoming more important and will change the way we work and live. They have been used in factories and car production for a long time, but now experts predict that they will be used in many other areas too. Many people think that robots will do most of the work that humans do now, but they also think that their jobs will not change. However, this is not true. Robots will replace many jobs, and people will need to find new ones.
For example, a company in Australia has developed a robot that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, which would take two human bricklayers a whole day to do. Another company has created a robot that helps keep supermarket shelves stocked and tidy. Some people think that robots will create new jobs for technicians and programmers, but others worry that they will make it harder for people to work with each other.
Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert on robotics, says that robots will get smarter and more efficient in the next few years. Many companies will have a person in charge of robots, and governments will make laws to ensure our safety and privacy. Zhang thinks that people will need to learn new skills to adapt to the changing job market.
In the future, robots will be used in our homes and will interact with us in new ways. This will create new opportunities for companies, but it will also bring challenges. It is important that we prepare for this change by studying science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) subjects.'

'Mountaineer George Mallory was once asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. His answer was simple: ""Because it's there."" This phrase has become famous because it shows that sometimes people do things just because they can, and it's an exciting challenge. Climbing is not just about reaching the top of a mountain; it's about the journey and the adventure.
A Bolivian writer, Tejada-Flores, wrote an essay called ""Games that Climbers Play"" in 1967. He identified seven different types of climbing, each with its own rules. He said that the way you climb depends on the rules of the game you're playing.
For many climbers, the reason they love climbing is the sense of freedom it gives them. They feel alive and free when they're climbing. But climbing can also be very challenging and restricting. You might get stuck in a tent during a storm, for example.
Some people argue that climbing is in our nature. We have an instinct to take risks and challenge ourselves. This is why we climb. Others believe that climbing helps us develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for the environment.
Climbing can also be a way to develop virtues like these. It's a way to challenge ourselves and become better people. Some climbers believe that climbing is more meaningful when you do it on your own, without relying on others or technology. They think that this shows that you're more committed to your goal.
Climbing can also be a way to experience the present moment, to be fully engaged in what you're doing. It's a way to meditate and focus on the task at hand. Some people even compare climbing to Zen philosophy, where the goal is to reach a state of inner peace.
Overall, people climb for many reasons. It's a complex activity that can be both exciting and challenging. It's a way to experience the world and ourselves in a new way.'

""In recent years, there has been a shift in higher education towards encouraging students to get involved in research from the start of their studies. This is because research is not just for famous scholars or experts in a particular field. It's a natural way to build knowledge and skills that can be useful in many areas of life. As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions and finding answers. You don't just repeat what you've learned, you make new discoveries.
Research involves asking questions like 'Why?', 'How?', 'What does this mean?', and 'What if?' It's about exploring and understanding the world around us. There are different types of research, from simple everyday investigations to complex, groundbreaking studies. As a student, you may have already been doing research without realising it. For example, you might have investigated a topic for a school project or asked questions to solve a problem.
In higher education, you are expected to be curious, ask questions, and think critically about what you read and hear. You need to evaluate information and ideas, and construct your own responses and knowledge. This can be challenging, especially if you're used to following established knowledge and authority. However, in many countries, including the UK, US, and Europe, it's important to question what you're told and to think for yourself.
Critical thinking is essential in research. You need to engage with what you read, think about it, and test it out. You should also be aware of how information is presented and whether it's logical and backed by evidence. Don't just accept what you're told without questioning it.""

Cities have always been important for intellectual life. In the past, people would gather in coffee shops to discuss new ideas. Today, people still come together in cities to share their thoughts and creativity. However, city life can be overwhelming and stressful. In fact, scientists have found that cities can even affect our thinking and memory.
One of the main reasons is the lack of nature. Studies have shown that patients recover faster when they can see trees from their hospital windows. Even a quick glimpse of nature can improve our mental performance. This is because nature provides a break from the hustle and bustle of city life.
For the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of being surrounded by green spaces, we are surrounded by concrete and crowds. This can have negative effects on our mental and physical health. Cities are full of distractions, from pedestrians to traffic, which can be exhausting.
The human brain is like a powerful computer, but it takes a lot of energy to focus. Natural settings, on the other hand, don't require as much effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory. It was first developed by a psychologist who thought that being in nature could help our brains relax and recharge.
Philosophers and architects have long warned about the effects of city life and have looked for ways to bring nature into cities. Urban parks, like Central Park in New York, can provide a break from city life and even improve our brain function.
So, why do cities continue to grow, despite their negative effects? Research suggests that the same features that can be overwhelming can also lead to innovation and creativity. The concentration of people and interactions in cities can stimulate new ideas.
The key is to find a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of city life. While cities can be stressful, they can also be a source of inspiration and creativity."

Where should we look for the mind? Some people might think that thinking happens only inside our heads. However, there is evidence from the past to the present that shows that objects and things also play a role in our thinking. From an archaeological perspective, it is clear that tools, jewelry, and written symbols have helped shape human evolution and our minds.
It is easy to see why people often think that the mind is just the brain. Scientists have studied the brain by isolating people from their surroundings, which makes sense when using brain-scanning machines. However, this can lead to overlooking the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads. I am not questioning the role of the brain in thinking, but rather suggesting that the mind is more than just the brain.
Instead, I propose exploring the idea that our intelligence extends beyond our skin and into the world around us. This is the basis of my Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET examines how objects become extensions of our bodies and how we use them to think and solve problems. For example, using a stick to feel our way around or making numbers with clay.
This approach can help us better understand what minds are and how they work. Think of a blind person using a cane. Where does their sense of self begin? The stick becomes an extension of their body, and they use it to turn touch into sight. This shows that our minds are capable of reorganizing themselves in response to new technologies and innovations.
I believe that the human mind is an ongoing project, always evolving and changing. We use objects to discover and understand the world around us, and in return, those objects shape our minds. I call this process metaplasticity – our minds are constantly developing and changing as we interact with the world.
MET offers a new way to understand how different types of objects, from ancient tools to modern smartphones, have helped shape our minds and our thinking. This is not a new idea, but rather a way to recognize that humans have been using technology to change their minds since the beginning of time.

Photography has had a huge impact on our way of life and how we understand the world. In the United States, photography quickly became an important part of the country's culture, influencing many areas, from science and industry to art and entertainment. Historians consider photography to be the country's most significant contribution to the visual arts.
Photography was appealing because it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology in the US. The camera brought the world into people's homes, making it easier to share and discover new things. Additionally, the camera was a popular tool for capturing and presenting one's identity, which was important in a country where individual and national identities were constantly being redefined.
The camera also played a significant role in creating and maintaining family records, allowing people to preserve memories and create a sense of continuity. Furthermore, the photograph's realistic style fit well with the artistic trend of representing everyday life in the US.
A photograph is a way of drawing attention to something, saying ""Look at this!"" Every picture has its own unique characteristics, being a record of what was in front of the camera, yet also carrying the photographer's perspective. Photography has been called a ""universal language,"" but the meaning of a photograph is often influenced by the context in which it is seen.
To understand a photograph historically, we need to consider its purpose, function, and the cultural context in which it was created. The same image can have different meanings in different situations and places. In recent decades, many artists have incorporated photography into their work, recognizing its importance and versatility.

William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the'science of mental life'. This definition is still relevant today. We all have a mental life, and we know what that means. However, psychology is a complex subject that can be difficult to understand. James believed that psychology involves three main elements: thoughts and feelings, the physical world, and how we learn about these things. Each of us has our own way of understanding the world, based on our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences.
When we talk about psychological matters, we often rely on our own experiences and opinions. For example, we might think we know why someone is behaving in a certain way, or whether a particular method works. However, this can lead to misunderstandings. That's why psychologists use scientific methods to figure out what's really going on. They try to identify the most likely explanations for a situation and the circumstances under which they apply.
Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists don't fully understand how the brain works. They study behavior and use observations to make educated guesses about what's happening inside our minds. The problem is that the mind is not directly observable, like an engine. Psychologists have to infer what's going on by observing behavior.
Studying psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle. Psychologists gather clues, analyze them, and use logical arguments to make sense of them. They develop theories and techniques to understand complex interactions. The goal of psychology is to describe, understand, predict, and control the things it studies. By achieving these goals, psychology can help us understand ourselves and make practical applications in areas like education, technology, and mental health.
Psychological findings have been useful in many areas, such as teaching children to read, designing safer machines, and helping people with emotional problems. Although people have been discussing psychological questions for centuries, the scientific study of psychology is relatively new, dating back about 150 years. Early psychologists used self-reflection to study the mind, but this method has limitations. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior, rather than personal experiences.

In a warehouse in Michigan, USA, there is a special collection of failed products. It's like a museum, but instead of famous artworks, it displays products that didn't sell well. The collection is owned by a company called GfK and is known as the Museum of Failed Products. The owner, Carol Sherry, thinks each product tells a sad story about the people who designed, marketed, and sold it.
What's surprising is that this museum is a profitable business. Many companies don't keep track of their failed products, but the people who visit this museum are proof that it's not common. The museum's owner, Robert McMath, started collecting products in the 1960s. He wanted a reference library of consumer products, not just failures. But, surprisingly, most of the products he collected were unsuccessful.
This might be because of the way people think in the business world. Many people are too optimistic and don't want to admit when a product fails. They might keep investing money in a product that's not doing well, just to save face. This culture of optimism is especially common in the self-help industry, where people are encouraged to think positively about the future.
But is positive thinking really effective? A psychologist named Gabriele Oettingen and her colleagues have been studying this. They found that when people spend time thinking about how well things could go, it actually makes them less motivated to achieve their goals. On the other hand, people who believe that ability can be developed through hard work and challenge are more likely to view failure as an opportunity to learn and grow.
This idea is supported by another psychologist, Carol Dweck, who says that people's experiences of failure are influenced by their beliefs about ability. Some people believe that ability is fixed and that failure means they're not good enough. Others believe that ability can be developed and that failure is an opportunity to learn and improve. Dweck suggests that having an incremental theory of ability is a happier and more productive way to live, whether or not it leads to success.

Playing at home gives sports teams an advantage, but why is this? Many people think it's obvious, but professional sports are changing fast, and what we used to believe is no longer true. Two main reasons are changing our understanding of home advantage: science and money. Scientists want to know what makes players perform well, and they have come up with many theories. Businesspeople, on the other hand, want to know why home advantage still matters. If players are paid well, they should feel comfortable anywhere. So, what does this mean for fans? Would it matter if Manchester United played some of their home games in the Far East to attract more fans there? It would matter to British fans, who believe that their team needs their passion and support.
Many people think that when a team scores a goal, it's because the fans were cheering loudly. But this is not always true. Fans often remember the times when their cheering led to a goal, but forget the times when it didn't. However, there is one thing that fans do that is confirmed by science. Home fans often shout at the referee, trying to influence his decisions. In a study, referees were shown a match with or without crowd noise. The ones who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team.
Some people think that home advantage is declining because players are now treated better on the road. They used to have to travel a long way, but now they are flown around in comfort. This means that home and away games are not as different as they used to be. However, none of these explanations fully explain why home advantage is different in different sports. For example, basketball is the sport where playing at home is most helpful, while baseball is the sport where it is least helpful. One possible reason is that home advantage is more important in team sports, like basketball, where players need to work together. In individual sports like baseball, home advantage is less important.
There is another possible reason for home advantage. Research has shown that players' testosterone levels are higher before home games. This could be because they feel a strong sense of belonging and want to defend their home turf. This is similar to the way animals behave when defending their territory. In the recent Rugby World Cup, there were two games where underdog teams playing at home surprised everyone by winning. They used their aggression and determination to overcome the stronger teams. As one referee said, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""

'Gary Player, a famous golfer, once said, ""The more I practise, the luckier I get."" This phrase is popular among athletes and coaches. But what does it really mean? Player didn't mean he was lucky; he was being ironic. He meant that the more he practises, the better he gets. This idea is at the heart of a long-standing debate about whether natural talent or hard work is more important.
The debate is not balanced; it seems that hard work is more important. A psychologist, Anders Ericsson, believes that with 10,000 hours of practice, anyone can become an expert in any field. Many books have been written about this idea, including ""Outliers"" and ""Talent Is Overrated."" However, some experts argue that it's not that simple.
The author of a new book, Epstein, disagrees with the idea that 10,000 hours is enough to make someone an expert. He believes that there are many factors that contribute to someone's success, including their genes, environment, support, and determination. He looks at many examples, including the world's toughest sled dog race, where the dogs' drive and desire seem to be important.
Epstein also explores the idea that some people may have a natural talent or ability that cannot be changed by training or environment. He examines cases where genes play a significant role and discusses the importance of considering race and gender in sports. For example, he asks why men and women are separated in athletic competitions if only practice matters.'

A recent report shows that many children in wealthy countries are unhappy, lonely, and feel out of place. Jay Griffiths, a writer, asks why this is the case. In her new book, Kith, she suggests that the reason is that children are spending too much time indoors, staring at screens, and not enough time playing outside in nature. She believes that this is the main problem.
A follow-up study found that many children said they would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Many adults also remember their own happy childhoods, playing freely in the countryside or woods. However, they often forget that they are the ones who are now keeping their own children indoors, worried about their safety.
Griffiths argues that this is connected to the way parents are worried about the dangers of the outside world and the toys and gadgets that are designed to keep children entertained at home. She also criticizes the trend of giving children medication to calm them down or making them wear protective gear for simple activities like playing tag.
While Griffiths makes some good points, her book has some flaws. She sometimes presents her ideas in an overly romanticized way and doesn't consider counterarguments. She also believes that children need to take risks to learn how to manage them, but she doesn't explain how to achieve this.
The main idea of the book is that children should be allowed to have autonomy and explore the world around them, even if that means taking some risks. However, not all children may want to do this, and some may prefer to stay close to home."

As a researcher in child psychology, I've studied the importance of play in children's development. My research shows that play is essential for learning and growing. Children need to play to develop their problem-solving skills, creativity, and ability to work with others. These skills cannot be taught in school, but are learned through play.
All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Children play more than any other young animals because they have the most to learn. Play is the natural way for children to learn and develop. It's how they learn to think creatively, work with others, and control their emotions.
In the past, children had more freedom to play and explore. They played with each other, made their own games, and learned from each other. But now, schools are more rigid, and children have less time to play. They are forced to follow a curriculum and do homework, which takes away from their free time.
We need to give children more freedom to play and explore. We need to allow them to follow their natural instincts and learn through play. If we don't, we risk raising children who are not prepared for the challenges of the future.

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to find work. They can connect directly with potential employers through platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn. However, this increased access also means there's a higher risk of making mistakes. A recent incident on LinkedIn highlights the importance of being careful. A young jobseeker contacted a marketing executive, thinking she could help him find a job. But the executive was not impressed and sent a harsh rejection message.
This incident shows that social media can be a double-edged sword for jobhunters who don't know how to use it properly. Many young people have grown up using social media for personal reasons, such as Facebook and Twitter, where they can be whoever they want to be. But when it comes to professional networking, this approach doesn't work.
Young people need to understand that social media is different when used for work. They should be careful not to come across as arrogant or over-familiar. Instead, they should introduce themselves clearly, explain what they can offer, and be humble in their approach. This way, they can increase their chances of getting a positive response.

'Predicting the future of newspapers is difficult. The numbers show that most UK national newspapers have lost between a third and half of their readers since 2000. In the US, only 26% of people get their news from newspapers, compared to 45% in 2001. Many experts think that the last printed newspaper will disappear within 15 years. However, old media have a habit of surviving. For example, theatre survived the rise of newspapers, radio, and television. Even vinyl records have made a comeback.
Newspapers were once new media, and it took time for them to become the main source of news. This was because producing news for a large audience over a wide area became practical and economic in the 19th century. People also started to expect change and updates on what's happening around them.
Before the 19th century, people's lives were cyclical, and they didn't need news on a regular basis. Journalism as a job didn't exist until then. Even now, there's no obvious reason why people need news daily or weekly. Online news allows us to choose what we want to read and when, and correct mistakes quickly. However, many news providers focus on being the first to break the news and creating controversy, rather than helping us understand the world.
In the past, news was shared in marketplaces and taverns, where truth and rumors mixed together. In some ways, we're returning to that world. Newspapers have never been great at explaining how the world works. Maybe they will disappear, or maybe they'll find a way to guide us to wisdom and understanding.'

If humans were meant to live in the dark, we would be happy in the midnight world. However, we are daytime creatures, with eyes adapted to the sun's light. This is a fundamental fact that is deeply rooted in our biology. Although we don't often think about it, it's the reason we've changed the night to suit ourselves. We've filled the night with artificial light, just like we would dam a river. This control comes with consequences, known as light pollution. Scientists are only now studying its effects.
Light pollution is mainly caused by poor lighting design, which allows light to shine upwards and outwards into the sky, where it's not needed. This washes out the natural darkness, affecting many living things, including ourselves. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it affects certain aspects of life, such as migration, reproduction, and feeding. In the past, the phrase ""light pollution"" wouldn't have made sense. Imagine walking through a moonlit London in the 1800s, when it was the world's most populous city. People used candles, torches, and lanterns, and only a few houses had gas lights. From a distance, you would have smelled London more than seen its dim glow.
We've lit up the night as if it were an empty space, when in reality, many species thrive in the dark. Light is a powerful force, and many animals are attracted to it. Scientists have seen birds being ""captured"" by searchlights and gas flares, circling and circling until they drop. Migrating birds often collide with brightly lit buildings, and young birds on their first journey are more likely to be affected. Some birds sing at unusual hours when they're near artificial light.
It was thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, who need a clear view of the night sky. However, like many other creatures, we need darkness to maintain our physical and mental well-being. Denying darkness is futile, as it's essential for our biological rhythms. Messing with these rhythms can cause physical problems. The regular pattern of day and night is fundamental to our being, and altering it is like changing our center of gravity.
In the end, humans are trapped by light pollution, just like frogs near a brightly lit highway. We've cut ourselves off from our natural and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us lose sight of our place in the universe and forget our scale, which is best measured against the vastness of a deep night with the Milky Way above.

""The founder of a large company has announced that the company will no longer keep track of employees' paid holidays. This decision was inspired by an internet company that has already implemented a similar policy. The founder says the idea came from an email from his daughter, who suggested that employees should take as much time off as they want as long as it doesn't harm the business.
But is this idea practical? The internet company has only 2,000 employees and provides a single service, while the large company has 50,000 employees and many different services. It's hard to imagine how employees in a large company could know if their absence would harm the business.
The founder says that employees can take as much leave as they want if they're sure it won't damage the business or their careers. But can they really be sure? Even if they prepare well for their holiday, there's always a lot of work to come back to. This can make people feel guilty and stressed, which can negatively affect their productivity.
The policy could also lead to pressure from colleagues and gossip about who's on holiday and for how long. This can make people feel uncomfortable and unsure about taking time off. In the corporate world, there's already a culture of working late, and this policy could lead to a 'no holiday' culture.
Modern technology has blurred the line between work and leisure time, making it hard to disconnect from work. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees asked how to reconcile their new way of working with their old holiday policy. However, this policy could also mean that all hours are potentially working hours, making it hard for employees to know when they're really off work.
Workers are entitled to a minimum amount of paid annual leave because it's important for their mental and physical health. Increased morale, creativity, and productivity can exist without this, but it's unclear if this is the true intention or outcome of this policy.""

'Journal-based peer review is considered the most important way to ensure the quality of scientific research papers. It's a process where experts in the same field check and comment on a paper before it's published. This helps to prevent bad or incorrect research from being published. However, this process can take a long time, up to a year, which is a significant delay. Some people think it's worth waiting, but others are looking for a faster way to share and discuss research.
One alternative is to post a draft of the paper online, called a preprint, before it's been peer-reviewed. This allows others to read and comment on the research, which can lead to faster progress and more accurate results. Some scientists are starting to use preprints, and it's becoming a popular way to share research.
However, there are some concerns about preprints. Some people worry that they might not be as reliable as peer-reviewed papers, and that they could lead to the publication of bad research. But in reality, preprints are open to criticism and discussion, and authors know that their work will be reviewed and evaluated by the scientific community.
In fact, preprints can be very useful. They allow scientists to share their research quickly, which can lead to faster progress and more discoveries. They also provide a way for scientists to discuss and build on each other's work, which is an important part of the scientific process. Overall, preprints could help to refocus the scientific community on the most important thing - the research itself - rather than where it's published.'"

When I ask my students what a poem is, I usually get answers like 'a painting with words'. But I don't find these answers very satisfying. One day, I asked my students to choose an object and describe it in two different ways. One description should be like a scientist's report, and the other should be from the object's point of view, like a poem. One student chose an oxygen mask. This was a strange choice, but it helped us understand how poetry is special. Poetry is not like anything else in the world.
I didn't like poetry when I was at school. I thought it was confusing and got in the way of understanding and feeling. After school, most people don't read poetry much. Sometimes you see a poem and it stands out because it's different from regular writing. You might feel disappointed or confused, but you still try to understand it. What do we look for in a poem? We want to find deep feelings, beautiful images, thoughtful ideas, and clever language. But sometimes we find these things in other things like films, articles, novels, or music. There is one thing that poetry can do that's special: it can be ambiguous. Our daily lives are full of ambiguity, but poetry can make us think about it in a new way.
Some people try to define poetry by comparing it to other things, like animals or machines. But this doesn't really work. Instead, thinking about what poetry is can help us see the world in a new way. Poetry can get stuck in our heads, like a song. And sometimes a poem can have a big impact on us, even though it's just words on a page.
Poetry is different from other types of writing. It's not created to sell something, but for its own sake. Because of this, poetry can surprise us and make us think in new ways.
