Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of English at the B1 level:

Some time ago, a website talked about the risks of sharing our whereabouts online. The website said that when we post where we are, we're not just telling our friends, but also strangers. This made people realize that there might be a downside to sharing everything on the internet.

We can share many things online, like photos and stories, and it can be exciting. But sometimes we realize that we're not alone and that what we share can affect others. Some people have already learned this the hard way.

In the early days of the internet, some pioneers started sharing their lives online. They shared their thoughts, photos, and stories, and people started reading and talking about them. One of these pioneers was a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall. He started posting on the internet in 1994 and shared his life, including his thoughts and feelings.

Justin's website was popular, but he also faced problems. One day, he wrote about a romantic relationship, and his partner didn't like it. They asked him to stop writing about their relationship, or they would end the relationship. Justin stopped writing about his personal life, but the problem is still there.

Another example is Heather Armstrong, a young woman who worked in a software company. She wrote about her job on her blog, but an anonymous colleague sent her blog to her bosses, and she lost her job.

These stories show that what we share online can affect our real lives. We need to think carefully about what we share and how it might affect others.

'A while ago, some scientists started talking about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? The film shows that there's a lot we don't understand about the universe. Most scientists agree with this, but some were worried about the film's claims. They thought it was important to warn people about the film's ideas. 

At first, I didn't see what all the fuss was about. Scientists were talking about new discoveries that showed the universe is stranger than we thought. But then I started to understand what all the fuss was about. They were talking about discoveries like how water molecules can be affected by our thoughts. This was amazing! 

Some people think this is true because it's easy to understand and looks impressive. But scientists are more critical. They want more proof before they believe something. The film didn't give enough evidence, just some pretty pictures. 

The truth is that scientists are still discovering new things about the universe. They have found out that the universe is made of unknown matter and is being pushed by a mysterious force called dark energy. They have also found out that our brains can't keep up with what's happening around us, and that our brains edit out things we don't notice. 

We are still far from knowing everything. In fact, many things can't be fully understood. Scientists are trying to find a way to explain everything in one equation, but it's a big challenge. Some people think the universe is just incredible.'

I made the following changes:

* Simplified vocabulary: I replaced some words and phrases with more basic ones, such as ""at first"" instead of ""initially"", ""easy to understand"" instead of ""immediate"", ""pretty pictures"" instead of ""nice photos"", and ""big challenge"" instead of ""efforts to create the so-called Theory of Everything"".
* Reduced complexity: I broke up long sentences into shorter ones and removed some complex sentence structures.
* Removed technical terms: I avoided using technical terms such as ""peremptory"", ""darkly disturbing"", ""chaos and quantum uncertainty"", and ""theoretical physicists"", as they may be difficult for level B1 learners to understand.
* Maintained the main ideas: I kept the main points of the original text, including the idea that scientists are still discovering new things about the universe, and that the universe is stranger than we think.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B1 level learner:

Writing novels is a big challenge for me, but writing short stories is a joy. Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both processes are important and help me become a better writer. When I finish a novel, I usually want to write some short stories. When I finish a group of short stories, I want to start a new novel. I never write short stories while I'm writing a novel, and never write a novel while I'm working on short stories.

I started writing short stories in 1984. At first, it was difficult for me, but I enjoyed the experience. I felt like I could explore new ideas and worlds. My readers seemed to like my short stories too. One of my early short stories, 'Breaking Waves', was included in my first collection of short stories.

I like writing short stories because they don't take as long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to write a short story. Writing a novel can take a long time, sometimes a year or two. Writing short stories is a change of pace for me. I can write about small things, like an idea or a word, and see where it takes me. If an idea doesn't work out, I don't worry about it. I can try again. Writing short stories helps me learn and improve my writing. It's like an experiment for me. Without short stories, I wouldn't be able to experiment and try new things in my novels.

My short stories are like memories for me. I remember exactly where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are like a map to my heart. I'm happy to share these feelings with my readers.

Science is a complex subject that touches on philosophy and has a big impact on our daily lives. It helps us understand the world around us and has the power to cure diseases. However, it is not perfect and has its limitations. Scientists are people who try to understand the world, but they can make mistakes. The history of science is full of disagreements and conflicts. New ideas often challenge old ones, and it's not always easy to accept change.

This book looks at some of the most important ideas in science that have changed the way we think about the world. We will explore these ideas and look at their beauty and limitations. We will also consider how they have affected our lives and the world around us.

Science is always changing, and scientists are always finding new ways to explain the world. Sometimes these new ideas are big and change our understanding of the world completely. Other times, they are small and build on what we already know. Either way, science is an important part of our lives, and we need to understand it to make good decisions about our future.

In the past, science was mostly about observing the natural world. Now, we are starting to control it and make changes to the world around us. This gives us a lot of power, but it also means we have to be careful and think about the consequences of our actions. We can no longer just ignore science and hope it will go away. It's part of our future, and we need to be involved in shaping it.

'For a few years, book sales were growing. But then, some big publishers started to say that ebook sales were not growing anymore. In fact, some were even going down. This made people wonder if ebooks would replace print books. One person in the publishing industry said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments. He thought that people were too confident in the power of ebooks.

But the question remains: will ebooks replace print books? Some people think so, but others don't. The truth is that both ebooks and print books can coexist. The idea that ebooks will replace print books is an old one. Even before ebooks, people thought that new technologies would replace old ones. For example, when TV was invented, people thought radio would disappear. But radio survived by finding new uses.

The idea that ebooks will replace print books is not new. People have been saying this since the 1800s, when the phonograph was invented. They thought books would be replaced by audiobooks. This has happened many times before. New technologies have always seemed to threaten old ones, but they usually find a way to coexist.

We create emotional bonds with different media, like books, TVs, and computers. When a new technology comes along, we have to adjust to it. This can make us nostalgic for what we used to have. That's why we often see a demand for older technologies, like vinyl records or film cameras.

The spread of ebooks has made people appreciate print books more. They like the feel and smell of physical books. This should be reassuring for those who worry about the future of print books. However, the idea that ebooks will replace print books will continue to be a popular story. It's a way to talk about the power of technology and our fear of change.'

'For a year and a half, I wrote about how famous people from the past four hundred years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. I looked at what they did every day, including when they slept, ate, worked, and worried. By doing this, I hoped to learn more about their personalities and careers.

I believe that knowing someone's daily routine can tell you a lot about them. For example, what they eat and when they take a nap can say a lot about their character. In this book, I focus on the daily routines of creative people, not just their finished work. I want to show how their daily habits influenced their work and vice versa.

The book's title is Daily Rituals, but I'm really interested in people's routines. A routine can be ordinary, but it can also be a way to make the most of our limited time, energy, and willpower. A good routine can help us stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed.

I started this project because I was struggling to manage my own time and energy. One day, I was supposed to write an article, but instead, I spent the day tidying my office and making coffee. I then started looking at how other writers organized their days and found it interesting. This inspired me to collect these stories and share them with others. The book is a collection of daily routines from famous people, with quotes and summaries from their writings and interviews. I hope it will help readers learn more about how to manage their time and stay creative.'

Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in his family's plans when he was six years old. His father, a careful person, had to cancel their holiday to Spain due to high interest rates. Instead, they rented a chalet by the English coast. On a rainy August afternoon, Howard found an ammonite on the beach. This experience made him want to become a palaeontologist. He decided to focus on the early days of life on Earth. He didn't like the big, well-known dinosaurs; he was more interested in the small, ancient creatures that lived on rocks.

After finishing university, Howard wasn't sure if he would get a job. He knew he was good at his work, but he also knew that it's not always fair. He applied for a job at Tavistock College in London, but he didn't have high hopes. On the day of the interview, the professor who was supposed to chair the panel had an argument with his wife and was late. Another professor took his place, and Howard got the job. Howard was surprised and grateful, but later found out that the professor had helped him because he didn't like the other candidate.

Howard was happy to have the job and could finally do the work he loved. He often compared his professional life, where he could plan and work, to his personal life, where things didn't always go as planned. One day, someone stole his briefcase with his notes for a lecture. He was angry and had to postpone the lecture. Later, he met a colleague who was with a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. The curator told him about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied. Howard was excited and decided to go to Nairobi to study the fossils. He cancelled his other plans and found a way to go to the museum.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of English at level B1:

Charles Spence is a professor of psychology at Oxford University. He studies how our senses work together to create the taste of food. He has found that many things can affect how we taste food, such as who we eat with, how the food is presented, and even the background noise.

Spence has written a book about his research, called The Perfect Meal. He has also worked with famous chefs and food companies to help them create better-tasting food. For example, he has helped a company reduce the amount of salt and sugar in their products.

Spence has also worked with a famous chef named Heston Blumenthal to create special dishes that use sound to enhance the flavor of food. For example, they created a dish called ""Sound of the Sea"" that uses the sound of the sea to make the food taste more like the sea.

Spence's research has shown that many things can affect how we taste food, including the shape of the plate, the color of the food, and even the music we listen to. He has also found that some sounds can make food taste better, such as higher-pitched music, while others can make it taste worse, such as lower-pitched and brassy sounds.

In his free time, Spence enjoys eating and trying new foods with his family. He has even had dinner parties where they use special equipment to test how different sounds and lights can affect the taste of food.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for learners of English at the B1 level:

Our brains are working harder than ever. We're bombarded with information, fake news, and rumors, all pretending to be true. We need to sort through this information to find what's important and what we can ignore. At the same time, we're doing more tasks on our own. Thirty years ago, travel agents booked our flights and salespeople helped us find what we needed. Now we do most things ourselves. We're doing the work of 10 people, but still trying to keep up with our lives, families, work, hobbies, and favorite TV shows. Our smartphones help us do all this, but they also make us want to cram as much as possible into every spare moment.

However, research shows that our brains are not good at multitasking. We think we're doing several things at once, but really we're just switching between tasks quickly. This takes a lot of mental effort. Multitasking makes us less efficient and can even make us stressed. It's like trying to juggle many balls at once - we might think we're doing well, but we're actually just switching between balls quickly.

Our brains are wired to focus on one thing at a time. When we try to do many things at once, we're not using our brains effectively. In fact, multitasking can make us less smart and more likely to make mistakes. It's like trying to learn new things while watching TV - the information goes to the wrong part of our brain, making it harder to understand.

We also make many small decisions every day, like answering emails or texts. These decisions take up a lot of mental energy, and after a while, we can get tired and make bad decisions. Many business leaders, scientists, and writers agree that email is a big problem. It's not the email itself, but the huge amount of communication we receive that's the issue.

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino liked to break concrete into small pieces and throw them at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other bats that are having trouble giving birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought animals just behaved in certain ways and that was it. They didn't think about whether animals felt emotions or had moral rules. But now, scientists are starting to study animal emotions and moral rules. They are even writing books about it, like ""Wild Justice"" and ""Do Fish Feel Pain?"". This has started a big debate: can animals really think and feel like we do? This debate also makes us think about whether animals have a sense of right and wrong. In one experiment, cows had to open a gate to get food. The cows that opened the gate themselves seemed happier than those that didn't. If cows like solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? Some people think it means we should stop eating meat. Others think we should just learn more about animal thinking. There are different opinions on this topic, and it's hard to know what to think.<|eot_id|>"

'Thinking critically is a way to understand what we read or hear more deeply. Adrian West, a researcher at the Edward de Bono Foundation in the UK, believes that argument is a way to find the truth. However, he also thinks that technology is changing the way we approach complex problems. We are exposed to a lot of information, but it's not always good quality. This can make it hard for us to think clearly.

West says that the amount of information we have doesn't necessarily mean we are more knowledgeable or make better decisions. In fact, he thinks that the quality of our thinking hasn't improved much.

The National Endowment for the Arts says that people are reading less, and this might be because of the rise of visual media. Patricia Greenfield, a psychologist, thinks that this could be a problem. She says that when we focus on visual media, we don't develop our critical thinking skills as much.

Greenfield has studied how technology affects learning and found that it can have both positive and negative effects. For example, a computer game might help us think critically or make it worse. Reading on the internet can help us analyze information, but clicking on lots of links can make it hard to think deeply.

Greenfield says that technology changes the way we think, and this is a problem. She thinks that reading is better for our brains than watching TV or playing video games. Reading helps us use our imagination and think critically.

However, some people think that video games can be good for our brains too. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, says that video games can help us learn and think critically. He thinks that games like Sim City and Civilization can teach us important skills like decision-making and analysis.

In the end, it's clear that technology is changing the way we think, and we need to understand how it affects us.'

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic who also writes about how to live a good life. His latest book is about how to deal with modern technology and how it affects our lives. He was inspired to write it when he noticed that advertisements started appearing on his credit card machine while he was waiting for his transaction to process. He realized that we are constantly being distracted by things like advertisements and social media, and that it's hard to focus on what's really important.

Crawford thinks that this is a problem because it's making us lose touch with the world around us. We're spending more time looking at screens and less time talking to each other. He says that we're becoming more like machines, reacting to stimuli without really thinking about what's happening.

He believes that we need to find ways to be more present in the world, to engage with real things and people, rather than just representations of them. He gives examples of people who do this, like chefs, hockey players, and motorbike racers, who have to use their skills and judgment to work with real things.

Crawford thinks that we should find ways to use our judgment and pay attention to what's really important. This can be hard, but it's worth it because it makes us more focused and able to connect with others.

'What do you do for a living?' is a common question. But when someone says they are a philosopher, it can be difficult to answer. This is because people often think that philosophers are special or have some kind of special knowledge. But philosophers are just like everyone else. They study and think about big questions.

A long time ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle said that a life of thinking and learning was the best kind of life. Many people still think this today. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that a life without thinking and questioning is not worth living. This means that we should always think about our actions and decisions.

But philosophy doesn't have to be complicated or only for experts. It's about thinking about our daily lives and making sure they are what we want them to be. It's not about being a special person, but about being thoughtful and aware.

Unfortunately, philosophy has become less connected to everyday life. Many philosophers work in universities and write books that only other experts can understand. This makes it hard for ordinary people to understand philosophy. But this doesn't have to be the case. Philosophy can help us think about our lives and make better decisions.

I am a philosopher and my work is mostly about ethics, which is the study of what is right and wrong. But I think there's more to philosophy than just deciding what is right or wrong. Philosophy can help us think about our values and attitudes, and how they affect our lives.

By thinking about these things, we can learn more about ourselves and the world around us. We might even discover that our beliefs are not as clear-cut as we thought. But this is okay, because thinking and questioning is what makes us human.'

'Eating is a big part of our lives, and many people think that thinking deeply about food can make it even more enjoyable. However, philosophers haven't always talked about food in a serious way. Instead, they have used food as a metaphor for other ideas, like learning. Some philosophers, like Epicurus, believed that pleasure and avoiding pain are important, but they didn't just mean eating and drinking. Today, the name Epicurus is often used to sell food and drink products.

Food is also a social and cultural thing. The food we eat comes from our communities and is often shared with others. This is why food is an important topic for philosophers to explore.

Food critics write about what they think of different foods, but some people think that tasting food is not a special skill. Instead, they think that good food critics are just better at describing what they taste.

Food can also be beautiful, like a work of art. Some people think that food should be considered beautiful, but others disagree because food is meant to be eaten and then gone.

There are also many ethical questions about food, such as what we should eat and why. Philosophers can help us think about these questions and come up with answers.

Cooking at home is different from cooking in a restaurant. When we cook at home, we often cook for people we love and care about. In a restaurant, the chefs have to cook for many people and make sure the food is good, but they don't have the same personal relationships with the people they cook for.

Food can also help us understand and connect with people from other cultures. For example, we can learn to appreciate their food and customs, and this can help us build friendships and bridges between cultures.'

Rob Daviau, an American game designer, created a new type of board game called 'legacy games'. He wanted to make games more exciting and challenging. He took an old game called Risk and changed it so that players' decisions had a lasting impact. For example, players might have to tear up cards or damage the board. The game is played over several sessions, and players can see how their choices affect the game.

Daviau worked on another game called Pandemic, which is a cooperative game where players work together to stop diseases. He then created a new game called SeaFall, where players become sailors exploring the world.

Designing legacy games is complex because designers need to think about all the possible choices players can make and how they will affect the game. To test the games, designers play them with a group of people and see how they unfold.

Many people love legacy games because they feel like they are part of a bigger story. They like the idea of making choices that have a lasting impact. One player, Russell Chapman, said that legacy games are the biggest innovation in game design in years.

The idea of legacy games is not new, but it has become popular recently. The concept is similar to video games and TV shows, where each episode builds on the previous one. Daviau thinks that people will soon get bored with legacy games and want something new.

Colby Dauch, the manager of the company that published SeaFall, thinks that legacy games are revolutionary and change the way we think about board games.

'One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at a New Zealand aquarium. He climbed out of the tank, crawled across the floor, and slipped into a drain that led to the ocean. This is a story that many people found exciting and funny.

People often imagine that animals are like us, and this is especially true for octopuses. They are very smart and can do many things that we can't, like opening jars or recognizing faces. But Dr. Frans de Waal, a scientist who studies primates, says that we often don't give animals enough credit for their intelligence. He thinks that we should recognize that animals are capable of many things that we thought were unique to humans.

Dr. de Waal has studied animals for many years and has found that they are much smarter than we thought. They can think about the past and the future, feel empathy, and understand what others are thinking. In fact, animals are very similar to humans in many ways.

In the past, people thought that animals were not very smart and could not do many things. But this was not always the case. In the past, people believed that animals were intelligent and could even be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, a famous scientist, also believed that animals were intelligent and could think like humans.

In the 20th century, scientists started to think that animals were just machines that reacted to stimuli, rather than thinking beings. This changed the way people thought about animals and how they treated them. But now, Dr. de Waal thinks that we are starting to realize that animals are intelligent and deserve our respect.

He believes that we should design tests that take into account the special abilities of each animal species. For example, squirrels are very good at remembering where they hide their food, while humans need apps to find their phones.

The story of Inky the octopus is a good example of how animals can amaze us. But Dr. de Waal thinks that we should be careful not to exaggerate the intelligence of animals. He believes that animals are capable of many amazing things, but we should not assume that they are as smart as humans.

The story of Inky has also shown us how important it is to appreciate the intelligence of animals. Dr. de Waal has run experiments to show how animals think and feel, and he believes that these findings can help us understand ourselves better.'

'Robotics is a new technology that is changing the way we work. It's like a revolution in the way we do things. Robots are already being used in factories and car production, but soon they will be used in many other areas too. Many people think that robots will take over most of the jobs that humans do, but they also think that their own jobs will stay the same. However, this is not true. Robots will change many jobs, including those in supermarkets and construction. For example, a robot can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, which would take two human bricklayers a long time to do.

Some people think that robots will create new jobs for technicians and programmers, but others worry that robots will take away the human touch and make work less personal. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert on robotics, says that robots will change the way we work and that people will need to adapt to these changes. He thinks that people should learn new skills to stay ahead in the job market.

Robots are getting smarter and more efficient, and soon they will be able to work with other robots and humans. Many companies will need experts to manage their robots, and governments will need to make laws to protect us from the risks of robots. Robots will also change the way we live at home, with robots that can move around and interact with us in new ways.

This change brings both opportunities and challenges.

A Bolivian writer, Tejada-Flores, wrote an essay called ""Games that Climbers Play"" in 1967. He identified seven different types of climbing, from climbing small rocks to climbing high mountains. He said that how you climb depends on the rules of the game.

Many people love climbing because it makes them feel free. However, climbing can also be very restrictive, like being stuck in a tent during a storm. There is a paradox in climbing - it can be both freeing and confining.

A US rock climber, Joe Fitschen, asks a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He thinks that climbing is in our nature, and we climb because it's natural for us to take risks and challenge ourselves.

Another writer, Brian Treanor, thinks that climbing helps people develop good qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. Climbing can also help people develop these qualities in our modern world.

Some climbers believe that climbing on your own is more challenging and rewarding than climbing with others. This can lead to controversy, as some climbers might take unnecessary risks.

Climbing can also be a way to be in the moment, to focus on the present, and to solve problems in a natural way. This is similar to the techniques used in Zen philosophy to achieve inner peace. Climbers might find that climbing helps them feel more at peace.'

'Alfred Brendel was a famous pianist who played classical music for many years. He was a serious person who liked to study and perform, but he didn't like to teach much. People who knew him well saw a playful side to his personality, but it was not often shown in his concerts. One day, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came backstage after a concert and asked for lessons. Brendel was surprised and didn't think much of it at first. However, he was impressed by Kit's playing and decided to give him lessons. Kit was 14 years old at the time and played the piano very well. Brendel was impressed by Kit's ability to listen to his own playing and make improvements. He also liked that Kit was willing to learn new things and was not afraid to make mistakes.

Now, Brendel is 80 years old and has stopped performing, but he still enjoys teaching Kit. He wants to make sure Kit doesn't get too much pressure and burn out too quickly. Kit is 19 years old now and is still learning and growing as a musician. He is also composing his own music, which Brendel thinks is very important. Brendel is happy to see Kit develop his skills and is proud of the progress he has made.'

When I was little, I thought all gardens were beautiful and peaceful. My grandfather's garden was special. It was near a river and had a gentle slope towards the water. You couldn't reach the river, but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds singing in the trees. I imagined that all gardens were like this - a place to escape and be alone. My grandfather's garden wasn't special because of big things like a greenhouse. Some of his neighbors had greenhouses made from old window frames. My father, my grandfather's son, was a quiet person. He didn't talk much, but he liked to make me laugh. He had funny phrases, like ""It's immaterial to me."" He wasn't very ambitious and didn't have a big dream. He became a plumber, which wasn't his passion. He was good at fixing things around the house, like building bookshelves. My parents moved house only once, but my mother loved to buy new furniture. She would often surprise me with new chairs. One day, we got a piano, but I was too scared to play it. My sister had lessons, but I never got to play. My mother said I wouldn't practice. I loved the river and would often go there with a fishing net. I would walk along the riverbank, looking for a good spot to take off my shoes and go fishing. I wanted to get out of school, but it seemed impossible. But then my father told me about a job as an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I was excited.

Lawrence MacEwen lives on a small island called Muck, off the coast of Scotland. I visit him there. The weather is rough, with strong winds and rain. But MacEwen is comfortable on his island. He shows me around and tells me about the other islands nearby. He has a sheepdog named Tie, who helps him with his sheep. MacEwen has lived on the island for a long time, and his family has been there for over 3,000 years.

The island is a working farm, and MacEwen's family runs it together. His wife, Jenny, helps him with the farm work. Their children, Colin and Mary, manage the island's cottages and hotel, respectively. Mary's husband, Toby, loves that their two boys can explore the island and sail boats in the summer.

Life on the island can be challenging. There is no electricity all the time, and mobile phones don't work well. But the islanders are used to it. One day, a boat brings some groceries and three musicians who play music in the island's tearoom. The islanders enjoy the music.

MacEwen tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. Her father bought a farm on a nearby island without seeing it first, and Jenny was sent to manage it. She didn't know much about farming, but she had good typing skills.

I stay on the island for a while, eating delicious food and enjoying the scenery. I even go fishing with a local man named Sandy and bring back fresh fish for dinner. But eventually, it's time for me to leave the island and take a ferry to my next destination. I'm a bit sad to go, but I'm also excited to see what's next.

'The video game industry used to be hard to get into. Many people thought it was just for young people who liked playing games. But now, the industry is growing and taking itself seriously. It's still not easy, though. Making a game takes a lot of skill, hard work, and attention to detail. Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for a games magazine, says that it's hard to get a job at a big company, but there are still opportunities. He thinks the industry needs more game designers, not just people who make big decisions, but also those who design individual parts of a game.

So, how can you get into this competitive industry? Jim says that the most important thing is to make games. You need to have some experience making games to get a job. John Field, another expert, agrees that making games is important, but he also thinks that having a good education can help. He says that a postgraduate course in games can give you the skills and support you need to succeed.

Most game designers start by working as programmers or artists, and then move up to design games. They need to be interested in all kinds of entertainment and art, and have a passion for games. It can also help to have connections in the industry. John thinks that games are becoming more popular and will continue to grow. He believes that games can be a great way to learn new things and sees a lot of opportunities in the future.'

'I've always loved playing football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me. I'm glad he didn't, because it made me enjoy it more. I had a friend who was pushed by his dad to play, but he stopped playing and never did it again. I'm lucky it wasn't like that for me. When I score a great goal, people say it's just luck, but I've worked hard to get good at it. Practice makes perfect. Even the best players in the world need to practice a lot to be good.

I used to play many sports at school, but football was my favourite. My teachers did a good job, but I didn't realize it at the time. Now I want my son to enjoy learning and playing sports too. We're already reading books to him, even though he's too young to sit still. I hope he doesn't want to kick the books around like I did!

When I started my professional football career, my manager gave us opportunities to play in the first team. He didn't make a big fuss about it, but we knew we had to work hard. We lost our first game, and a TV presenter said we couldn't win anything with young players. But we didn't listen to him. We believed in ourselves and worked together as a team.

I rely on my friends and family, but having a lot of money can be a problem. People sometimes think I'm too generous, but I like to help my family and friends. I've paid off my parents' mortgage and bought them a car. My mum loves her job as a hairdresser, and I don't want to make her stop. I have a lot of money, but it doesn't solve all my problems. After I stop playing football, I want to take a break and do things I haven't had time for before.

We moved to Reef Point because of Sam Carter, my father's agent in Los Angeles. He found a cheap place for us to live because my father couldn't write while we were in LA. The beach was usually empty because of the fog, but during the summer, it became popular. My father worked hard to write a script, but I often went to the beach with my dog Rusty. Rusty was a stray who liked to dig and bring me things he found. Sometimes, he would find things that didn't belong to him, like a new shoe or a beach towel. I would return these things to their owners.

My father thought Rusty was a nuisance, but I liked him. He loved the beach and swimming. He would always come with me when I went swimming, even though he couldn't swim as well as I could. After my father left to deliver the script to Los Angeles, Rusty and I spent the afternoon swimming and watching the surfers. One surfer caught my eye - she was very good. She asked me why I didn't join them, and I said I didn't have a surfboard. She suggested I could buy one, but I said I didn't have enough money. She asked if my father was American, and I said no, he was writing a script for a novel he had written. She knew the novel and asked if my father was Rufus Marsh.

Her friend Annie had told her to arrive late, but this time it seemed like a bad idea. Suddenly, an announcement came over the loudspeaker: the computer system had broken down. The atmosphere among the passengers became gloomy. Some people were frustrated, but Violet was worried. She had paid a lot of money for this trip and didn't want it to be ruined. She was also worried because she had left her phone at home. This meant she couldn't call the taxi company to check if she had left it there. 

As she stood in line, Violet met a friendly couple behind her. She asked to borrow their phone to call her son Harry, who could help her find her phone. She left a message asking her neighbor Kristina to check her flat to see if the phone was there. Violet was relieved that she wouldn't be in trouble, but she didn't tell Harry this. 

Finally, the queues started moving, and Violet went to the window to show her travel documents. She was disappointed when she saw the ship's foyer, which was not as luxurious as she had expected.

I interviewed Eleanor Catton when she was in the UK for a book promotion tour. She was very calm and friendly, despite being very busy. She told me a funny story about being stopped at the airport and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed the official her book and he asked what it was about.

Eleanor Catton wanted to write a murder mystery, but she found that the past offered many opportunities for complications and misunderstandings. Her book is over 800 pages long because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good part. When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at such a young age, she said it was nice because everyone in her small country feels like they are part of her success.

Eleanor Catton also talked about the structure of her book. She wanted to write it in a spiral shape, with each part getting shorter. She said she didn't plan the book beforehand, but instead tried to write herself into a difficult situation and then find a way out. She also wanted to make the book fun for readers.

I asked her if she might want to write for TV or film, and she said it could be interesting. She loves watching TV dramas and thinks her book would work well on screen. She also talked about how her home country, New Zealand, inspires her writing. She likes the quiet and peaceful environment, which helps her to focus on her work.

Jonny Kinkead has been making guitars for over 40 years. As a boy, he loved playing guitar and building things with his dad's tools. He learned to play guitar when he was 11 and started making his own instruments when he was 16. Jonny's passion for guitar-making never went away. He loves how different types of wood can create different sounds.

Jonny didn't always plan to make guitars for a living. He studied architecture in university, but dropped out halfway through. He realized that building guitars was a way to combine his love of art and music. He started making guitars part-time and eventually turned it into a full-time job.

It wasn't easy for Jonny to become a successful guitar-maker. He had to work hard to get known and learn how to price his instruments.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at the B1 level:

When talking about English conversations, it's common to start with the weather. This is because, as the famous writer Dr. Johnson said, ""When two English people meet, their first topic of conversation is the weather."" This is still true today. Many people try to explain why English people are so interested in the weather, but they often get it wrong. They think that English people are fascinated by the weather itself, but that's not the case.

In fact, English people don't really talk about the weather because they're interested in it. They talk about it because it's a way to start conversations and make small talk. It's like a code that helps people be friendly and polite. For example, saying ""Nice day, isn't it?"" or ""It's cold today, isn't it?"" isn't really about the weather at all. It's just a way to say hello or break the ice.

English people don't talk about the weather all the time. They only talk about it in certain situations, like when they meet someone new, when they're trying to start a conversation, or when they need to fill a silence. That's why it might seem like English people talk about the weather all the time, but really, it's just a way to be friendly and polite.

The students were interested, but they wanted to know why it was built. Alice didn't have a good answer, so she decided to write a book to help her explain it better.

After teaching for 31 years, Alice retired and started writing books. She wanted to write stories that would be interesting for children. She said, ""Teaching is like acting. You have to perform every day. Writing is exciting, but it's not as tiring."" Alice's friends who are also teachers are jealous of her because she gets to work with children through her stories.

Alice wants her books to fill a gap in the market. She thinks many books for children are either too sad or too fantastical. She wants her books to be in between. Alice used to teach English and History together. She loved seeing students go from being bored to being interested and understanding. She sees writing as an extension of teaching.

Alice started writing because she wanted to fill a gap in the market, but she was also inspired by the idea of not working with her children when they left home. Her head teacher suggested she take a creative writing course, and Alice was surprised. She had to send her best writing to the course organizers, and they accepted her immediately. The other students on the course liked her writing and encouraged her to publish it. Alice's husband, Zachary Leader, helped her edit her book. He read her chapters and suggested changes.

She showed that chimpanzees are not just wild animals, but have feelings and social lives similar to ours. Before her research, people didn't know that chimpanzees ate meat, used tools, or had emotions. Jane Goodall's book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"", is a leading reference book in the field.

Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist who can speak in many different voices. She can be a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an old Scottish woman, and even a fast-talking alien! She talks about what it takes to do voiceovers. 'Lots of actors think they can do funny voices, but it's not just about that,' she says. 'You have to bring the script to life for people who can't see you.' Shirley didn't always want to do voiceovers. She started out as an actress, but then she discovered she could do voices and that's what she wanted to do.

Shirley has worked on many different projects, including cartoons, educational videos, and even vacuum cleaner adverts. She has to use different voices for different characters. For example, she has to make her voice sound lighter when she's playing a child. She collects new voices by watching children's TV and cartoons. Shirley thinks that the key to being a good voiceover artist is to be able to smile while you're talking. This makes your voice sound happy and cheerful.

It's very competitive to get work as a voiceover artist, but Shirley has been successful because she is determined and has a lot of experience. She recommends attending special workshops to learn more about voiceovers and to practice your skills. Shirley loves her job and is obsessed with voices. She even finds that sometimes she starts talking in different voices at home, even when she's not recording.

People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a dream job that many people have as children, like being a race car driver. But most people give up on these childish dreams and choose more realistic jobs, like being a lawyer or a car parts maker. It's hard to believe that you can make a living by drawing simple doodles, but some people do it. Not everyone becomes a cartoonist in the same way, but most who do have wanted to do it for a long time. I studied graphic design in college and then started drawing cartoons for different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted to publish my work. You don't need a lot to become a cartoonist. You don't need a university degree, you don't need a lot of money, and you don't even need to be a good artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. But it's not easy to be a cartoonist. You need to be good at many things and be willing to work hard. I've done many different types of cartoons, including political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also written, drawn caricatures, and designed things. I don't turn down any work, because you can learn a lot from any job. It's also helpful to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world. The business side of being a cartoonist can be difficult. It used to be easy to find a job drawing cartoons for newspapers and magazines, but now it's harder. Most cartoonists have to sell their own work. The more comfortable you are with this, the better you'll do. I've seen many cartoonists with average artistic skills but good business skills do better than those with amazing artistic skills but no business skills. Some people are worried that someone will steal their ideas, but you can protect your work by putting a 'c' for 'copyright' on it. It's more likely that no one will be interested in your work, but if someone steals your cartoon and it becomes popular, it can be a good thing!<|eot_id|>"

I don't usually get rid of things easily, but I was going to throw this guitar away. I took it to the dump and was about to put it in the rubbish, when a young man stopped me. 'You're not going to throw that away, are you?' he asked. I said yes, but then felt sorry for what I was doing. He asked if he could have it, and I said okay. Later, I regretted giving it away. Then, a few months ago, I received an email from a guitar dealer named Keith. He said he had my guitar and wanted to sell it back to me. I was amazed! He had found a label on the back with my name on it and used it to find me online. I was so happy to get my guitar back. My dad used to put his name and address on everything I had, including my guitar. I forgot about that. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar, but I didn't like it. I switched to electric guitar and played simple songs. Now, I'm going to learn again. It feels good to play it again. Maybe I can even play with my son, who is learning the saxophone. We could call our band 'The Regainers'!

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at level B1 on the CEFR:

There's been a lot of talk about sleep recently. When I wrote a book about people who can't sleep, I felt like I was the only one warning about the dangers of not sleeping enough. Sleep is very important for our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important it is. So, it's good that sleep is getting more attention. But I'm wondering, what about dreams? We're not talking about dreams much. When we wake up early, we often cut off the last hour or two of sleep, which is when we have the most vivid and memorable dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time dreaming. When researchers don't let people sleep, they have more and more dreams the next night. This shows that dreams are important.

Some researchers used to think that dreams were a way to understand how our minds work. But now they think that dreams are more about our physical bodies than our minds. There isn't much agreement on what dreams are for. A scientist at Harvard University says that people who are creative, like actors, writers, and directors, have a better memory for their dreams. This makes sense, because creative people often use their dreams to come up with new ideas. But I think that everyone needs to use their dreams, not just creative people. We all need to think creatively in our daily lives, whether we're teachers, software designers, or politicians. Dreams help us bring together different ideas and find new connections. This can help us solve problems and come up with new ideas. For example, a scientist found that when people wake up from a dream, they can come up with more original ideas than when they wake up from other stages of sleep. I also find that when I wake up from a dream, I can write more easily. Even if the dream is scary or hard to remember, it can help me think more clearly. This is why we all need to dream.

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London and moved to a small coastal town in England. She has a studio with a beautiful view of the sea. You can see empty frames on the walls and photos of her two daughters smiling. Susie is a very good artist who copies famous paintings. She can make them look exactly like the originals. People love her work and buy it from her. She has copied paintings by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh.

Susie is very good at her job, but she doesn't have any of her own paintings at home. She finishes them and sells them to galleries and private collectors. Some people buy her paintings because they like art, but others do it because they want to show off. Susie says it's okay if people display her copies as if they were the originals, but she doesn't do it herself.

Susie used to work as an illustrator for a botanical garden, drawing plants. She was very good at it and learned to be very accurate. She didn't get paid much, but it helped her develop her skills. Now, she specializes in copying French impressionist paintings. She thinks people underestimate how hard it is to copy these paintings because they look easy, but they are actually very difficult.

Some people ask Susie why she doesn't create her own paintings. She says she has tried, but they don't turn out as well as her copies. She is a perfectionist and likes to do what she is good at. She makes a good living from copying paintings, and she is happy with her job.

Jordan's team, which includes his parents, wants to inspire other young people to get outside and be active. They also want to climb the highest mountains on each continent, which is a very difficult challenge. Some experienced climbers think it's not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest because they might not be strong enough emotionally or have enough experience. Jordan's parents, who are also climbers, think they can help him and that he is getting stronger and more responsible every day. Jordan says he loves the challenge of climbing and wants to achieve his goal. His parents want him to stay motivated and focused on his goal.

'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, you can be sure they're not listening to classical music. Most people know the names of many pop groups, but ask your friends if they know who Brahms is and you'll see a surprised face. I'm studying music at university, but my classmates know just as little about classical music as anyone else our age. If you don't know who wrote the music, you're unlikely to buy their records. The statistics are worrying for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and most classical albums sell fewer than 300 copies. So, why has classical music lost its appeal? The older generation blames our love of TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is that classical music doesn't interest most people, especially teenagers. I know some teenagers who love classical music, but they're a minority. I'm a musician and play in an orchestra, but I'm not a big fan of classical music myself. I like many types of music, but my computer shows that I listen to classical music very little. So, why don't teenagers like classical music? One reason is that classical music is slow and has many changes in mood, which is hard for us to follow. We like fast-paced music and prefer to listen to it while doing something else. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music requires concentration. Pop music also deals with issues that are more relevant to teenagers. The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would make music together at home, and being able to play an instrument was important. Nowadays, you can find any music you want on the internet, and classical music is rarely part of our daily lives.'

Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother's car and looked at Almonside School. 'I'll show you,' she said to the school. Her mother was getting out of the car at the same time, but Bonnie wouldn't have minded if she had heard. Bonnie's mother knew how she felt.

Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside School was a strange place, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside. It was confusing at first, but then she saw signs on a post: 'Science block', 'gymnasium', 'riding centre'. 'Riding centre,' Bonnie said, showing interest. 'The headmaster's study,' her mother said. 'This way.'

Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between trees. 'I wish you would walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,' her mother said, but Bonnie didn't do as she was told. A few minutes later, her mother was talking to the headmaster in his office, while Bonnie sat outside the door. Bonnie got up. 'Why should I just sit here?' she thought. 'I'll be sent away soon anyway, so why not get it over with?' She left the building and went to the riding centre. There was a nice old building where the horses were kept, and a big structure for indoor riding. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She approached the horses with respect. She liked horses.

Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, looking at each horse and judging it. 'I know what they're doing here,' she said to a small pony. 'You know, I think I've met you before,' she said to another horse. 'In my dreams, and I was riding you in a big competition...' The horse's name was Maverick. Bonnie couldn't resist the temptation to ride him. She found a saddle and bridle, and put them on Maverick. When she sat on his back, she felt like a queen. She laughed, remembering her nickname 'Queen Bee'. 'You're the best horse I've ever ridden, Maverick,' she said. 'I think we could be great friends if I stay here.'

She rode Maverick around the paddock, feeling happy and free. She could tell Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well.

Cody Simpson is a 15-year-old Australian singer who has already had a lot of success. I met him once and was impressed by his calm and confident personality. So, how did a surfer boy end up performing in front of thousands of people?

Cody started playing the guitar when he was six and writing songs when he was seven. But at that time, he was more interested in swimming and surfing. He went to school and posted some videos online. People loved them and asked for more. Cody was happy to share more videos, and the response was amazing.

Cody was a good swimmer and was training hard. But then record labels contacted him, and he had to make a difficult decision: stay in Australia and keep swimming or move to the US and pursue music. He chose to take the risk and move to the US with his family.

It was hard for him to make this decision at such a young age. He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was leaving. They were all surprised. Cody is a modest person and thinks it's important to stay humble in the music industry.

Cody's family is not in the spotlight, but they support him. He thinks it's important to have a small group of close people around you to keep you grounded. Of course, he has doubts sometimes. He worries about how his decision affects his younger brother and sister. But his family reassures him that they are there to support him.

Cody's story shows that success comes from taking risks and saying ""yes"" to opportunities, even when they are scary. He never thought he would be performing in front of so many people, but it's happening. He knows it won't last forever.

I woke up early and looked out of my bedroom window. The river was frozen, but there was a small crack in the ice. I could see the wall of sandbags along the riverbank, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding. My back was still sore from lifting the sandbags the previous week. I had worked with the rest of the town's adults for many hours to get the job done. My grandfather didn't seem to care, though.

As I got dressed, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. He was trying to balance on a thin piece of ice near the warm water coming from the factory. I put on my special wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked my pocket for a special chain my grandfather gave me, which is very important to me. I also have a diary he kept on one of his adventures, which I like to read before I go to sleep.

I went downstairs to the kitchen, where my mom was making breakfast. 'Good morning, Rex,' she said. 'You're up early today. Be careful kayaking.' I said goodbye to my mom and headed out the door.

As I was leaving, I ran into my grandfather. 'Watch where you're going!' he shouted. 'Where are you going?' I told him I was going kayaking. He's always grumpy, but I try not to mind. He's been acting strange lately, and I feel sorry for him.

I put on my kayaking gear and headed to the river. As I was getting ready, I saw the boy from earlier trying to balance on the ice again. I decided to go and help him.

Mum took Jess's arm and led her to the study. There, on the table, was a painting by Grandpa. It was unfinished and looked very different from his other work. 'Do you know anything about this?' Mum asked. Jess shook her head. 'I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on something new.' The painting showed a river, but it was not a real river. It was a fantasy river. The picture was strange and beautiful in a weird way. There were no animals, no birds, no people. Jess was drawn to the painting. Mum said, 'It has a name.' Jess read the words on the back: 'River Boy.' She felt a strange connection to the name, but she didn't know why. Mum told her that Grandpa never gave his paintings names, but this one had a name. Jess looked at Mum and asked, 'There is no boy in the painting.' Mum said, 'Exactly. It's strange that he would give it a name like that.' Jess knew that Grandpa never explained his paintings.

'The Borrowers' is a story about a family of small people who live in the walls and floors of a house. They take things from the normal-sized people who live in the house to survive. When I was asked to make a TV version of the book, I knew it would be difficult. People who love the book have strong ideas about how it should be done. I used the original drawings from the book to make sure I got it right. The author wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the point of view of the normal-sized people. This made filming more complicated. The most important thing was getting the size right. The Borrowers are much smaller than humans, so we had to film them from a distance that was 10 times further away than normal. When filming the normal-sized surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from very low down. We only raised the cameras above their height for special shots. One challenge was making the shadows look right when we combined the images of the small Borrowers with the normal-sized surroundings. We developed a special technique for this. After the series was shown, a famous film director, George Lucas, called me to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards of the house. It was very surreal. The actors had to carry big objects, like giant scissors, and it was funny. We had to stop filming sometimes because the crew was laughing too much. There was one scene where the Borrowers get swept away by a drain. The actors had to go through a tunnel with water and they said it was very scary. I was careful about the costumes, making them look like doll clothes. The actors had a hard time wearing them and couldn't sit down or take them off. The weather was very hot during filming, and the actors didn't thank me for the costumes! We had to film most scenes with the actors separate from their surroundings, in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I drew pictures of every scene to show people how it should look. It took me a long time, but it worked. We had to work fast and efficiently - I even shot a whole scene before realising there was no film in the camera! But in the end, I think the series was successful in capturing the magic of the book.'

'American teenagers have a lot of responsibilities. They are expected to be good students, have a part-time job, volunteer, and do well in all these areas. This is what it means to be an American teenager today. Teenagers can't just blend into the background; they need to stand out. Many people think that teenagers are lazy, but this is not always true.

Teenagers have a lot of stress. They have a lot of homework, tests, and activities, and they also have to take care of their daily responsibilities at home. On top of this, they try to have some kind of social life. This can be very tiring.

Some people think that teenagers spend all their time watching TV and playing with their phones. But this is not true. Teenagers use their phones to help them with their work and to stay in touch with their friends. They can do their homework anywhere, at any time.

Teenagers start their day early and often finish late at night. They have to get up early and do their homework, and then they have to do it all again the next day. Many teenagers don't get enough sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation says that only about 20% of teenagers get the recommended nine hours of sleep a night.

Despite all their responsibilities, many teenagers still find time to help others. They volunteer and do things that help their community. They don't just focus on themselves; they care about others too.

'The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live near Bishop, a town in the US surrounded by mountains. They have been launching balloons into space for several years. The balloons go up to 35 km high, and the students use them to study the stars and the Earth's atmosphere. They also have an adventure while doing it. I joined them one weekend to see how they do it.

On this day, they were going to launch a balloon to see shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and makes a bright light. They attached a special box to the balloon with a camera, a device to measure altitude, and a thermometer to measure the temperature. They also attached two GPS trackers to find the box later.

The balloon grew bigger and bigger, like a small car, and then it took off. The students ran to track its path with flashlights, and they were amazed by the sight. Then the balloon disappeared into the night.

After the launch, some students went home, but a few stayed to watch the stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and looked at the sky. It was very clear and beautiful, and they could see many stars. One boy fell asleep, and the others whispered to each other.

The balloon eventually popped and the box fell back to Earth. The students used the GPS trackers to find it the next day. It was a big adventure, and they enjoyed it. They have only lost two boxes out of 53 launches. They like the challenge of finding the boxes, and it helps them learn about the landscape and how to navigate it.

This time, the box landed 84 km west of Bishop, and it took them 11 hours to find it. It was in a canyon, near a waterfall. They didn't get any pictures of shooting stars, but they had a great time and learned a lot.'

Chloe remembers meeting a professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, for the first time. She was a bit nervous, but he was very kind and patient. He listened to her questions and made her feel at ease.

I ask Chloe about how palaeontologists are often shown in movies and TV shows. She says that they are often portrayed as eccentric geniuses or nerdy people who don't know how to relate to others. She thinks this is not very accurate.

Chloe's job is very varied. She spends time digging up dinosaur bones, studying fossils in the laboratory, and writing scientific papers. She also likes to explain science to the public and help young people understand it.

Chloe was involved in a TV documentary about dinosaurs called Walking with Dinosaurs. She was happy to help make sure the dinosaurs were accurate and realistic.

Here's a simplified version of the text for a learner of level B1 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR):

When you're on a car trip with your family, you probably know you're not there yet, even if you keep asking 'Are we there yet?' And the truth is, once you arrive, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here'. So, if you really think you're 'there' yet, you should ask 'Are we here yet?' 

As a child, you might think it's boring to be in the back seat. You can watch movies, listen to music, or do puzzles while looking out the window at the passing scenery. The grown-ups are in charge and take care of everything, making sure everyone is happy. But sometimes, one of your siblings might do something annoying, like put their foot on your side of the seat. This can lead to a fight, and the grown-ups will tell them to stay in their own seat and keep their hands to themselves.

Sometimes, the car ride can get a bit crazy. You might feel a breeze on your arm, but the window is closed and the car isn't going that fast. It's just your sibling blowing air on you on purpose. This can make you angry, and the fight might start again.

Grown-ups have ways to deal with kids on long car trips. For example, they might say, 'We're there!' even when you're still on the highway. This can keep everyone quiet for a while. And you know you're finally 'there' when the grown-ups get out of the car and go away from the kids.

So, remember: if the grown-ups are still near enough to answer your question, the answer is 'no, you're not there yet'.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B1 on the CEFR:

John and Zuzi Morgan have started a café in Oxford where people can play board games while having a cup of coffee and some cake. They want people to enjoy themselves so much that they will come back. Zuzi explains why they decided to open a café: 'People are always busy with their phones and other devices. We wanted to bring people together in a way that's not just about screens. It's natural for people to be together and communicate with each other.'

The games they play at the café are called 'Eurogames'. They are known for being fun and not too competitive. The first Eurogame was 'The Settlers of Catan', created by a German designer. Players build settlements and trade resources with each other. It's a fun game that keeps everyone involved until the end.

Another popular Eurogame is 'Pandemic', where players work together to solve problems. It was created by an American designer who was inspired by a game called 'Lord of the Rings'. He wanted to make a game that would make people feel good, whether they won or lost.

The growth of video games has actually helped board games become more popular. More people are playing games now than ever before. Some people started looking for a way to play games with friends and family in person, so they started playing board games again.

John and Zuzi's café is very popular, and people enjoy playing games together. In our online world, playing games has become something to be shared with others in person. This trend is likely to continue.

Here is the simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at level B1 (CEFR):

Jamie Scott is a successful songwriter and producer in the music industry. He believes that perseverance and determination are crucial for success, even if things don't go as planned at first. Jamie started playing the guitar because his mother was a great singer. He grew up listening to music on a local radio station that played old songs. He didn't hear a contemporary song until he was 12. At the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis, which he was good at, and music. He chose music because he loved it more. Jamie left school at 17 to pursue a career in music. He was part of a duo with a friend, but they didn't share the same passion for performing. Jamie's parents gave him 18 months to make it as a performer. If he didn't, he would have to get a job. After some close calls with record labels, Jamie was signed to a music publisher at 19. However, the labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to leave his friend. Jamie found success behind the scenes, rather than on stage. He has written for many artists and has helped launch their careers. Jamie believes that writing songs that people love and that sell well is not something to be ashamed of. He thinks it's okay to want to write huge songs that go to number one. Jamie is honest about his goals and doesn't try to make himself sound more acceptable to others. His goal is to write the best music possible.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level B1 on the CEFR:

Tony Connor is a famous street trials cyclist. He does amazing stunts on his bike, like jumping from one high place to another. These stunts are recorded and put on the internet. I met Tony at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids knew who he was and came to say hello. Even some older people came to admire him, calling him a 'legend'. I was impressed by his bravery, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, Tony explains what he's going to do, and I often think it's impossible. But he always manages to do it. After the stunt, I complimented him, but he seemed not to care. Despite being famous, Tony doesn't like the social side of being a celebrity. He prefers to focus on his bike riding rather than talking about it.

Tony's fame is thanks to social media and the small cameras that can record his stunts. He thinks this technology has given him the opportunity to make a living doing what he loves. However, he sometimes feels that people are too focused on taking selfies or watching screens. Tony's attitude is ironic because his fame is partly due to social media.

I've noticed that there are two important things that make someone a top athlete: energy and the ability to deal with disappointment. These qualities are more important than natural talent. The riskier the sport, the more important it is to have mental strength. Tony fell a few times when trying new obstacles, but he just got up and kept trying until he mastered them. Some people think Tony is reckless, but he says they don't understand the sport and the risks are minimized with expert advice.

Tony is aware of the risks he takes and knows that everyone is different. Some people are naturally brave, while others can be scared. Tony is in the group that feels fear but finds a way to overcome it. He's not addicted to risk and spends time planning and preparing before attempting a new stunt. He knows he has to stay focused before he jumps.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of English at the B1 level:

Helen Skelton is a TV presenter who has done many challenging things to help charity. She has run a long way in the desert and traveled down a river in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a thin wire 66 meters high between two tall buildings. There was no safety net, but she had a belt around her waist attached to a higher wire. She carried a long, heavy stick to help her balance. Helen took lessons from an expert wire walker. She found it very difficult because it was unlike anything she had done before. 'The training was a shock,' she said. 'I didn't know how strong I would need to be. Every day, I would run up a steep hill, do some exercises, and then practice on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could keep going. It hurt a lot every time I fell, but it was important to stay positive. If I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!' On the day of the challenge, it was windy, but Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. 'That was the scariest thing I've ever done,' she said afterwards. 'I'm glad it's over!' Despite this experience, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, kiting, and biking.

It's hard work. There are four of us, and we work six hours a day. We've been studying ducks in different places, and I've even taken a boat to some sites to make notes. The weather hasn't been great - some nights are mild, but most are cold and wet. It's very quiet, so I need a lot of coffee to stay awake!

On the one-year course, students learn new things each week and parents come to watch them. Sophia says that to be a good circus performer, you need to keep practicing and trying new things. It's also important to be friends with other performers and learn from them. You need to be fit, just like athletes, and train every day. The best performers are those who want to improve and never give up. Some people think that being a circus performer is dangerous or that you only work for a short time each year. But Sophia says the biggest challenge is thinking about the future. You can only perform for a while when you're young, and then you need to think about what you'll do next. The course also teaches students how to plan a business. Many students who finish the course start their own businesses all over the world and are happy to share their experiences.

I've always wanted to visit this area because our great-grandparents used to live there. I kept asking Harry if I could come, and finally, he agreed.

Before we left, there were bad storms in the area, but the forecast said it would be calm when we got there. I was busy at work and didn't have time to worry about what to pack, but Harry said he had everything under control.

When we arrived, we joined a group and took small boats to explore the coast. We saw very few people, only dolphins and birds. We could see some islands in the distance, but it was hard to see far because of the fog. I enjoyed watching the patterns our boat made in the water.

We stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish I had never seen before. It was great to not have to worry about time. We had lunch and dinner together over campfires. When we slept on the boats at night, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life.

When it was time to leave, I was sad to go back to normal life. But I knew I would miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also excited to tell everyone about our adventures when I got home.

I enjoyed taking pictures of many things, but then someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, it would be even better. So, I started taking pictures of nature, especially birds and the sky. Most of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing. Sometimes I doubted my project and thought about giving up. But I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style. My art teacher told me about a national photography competition for young people. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I was thrilled when the judges told me I won first prize! It was the first time I thought my photography might be good enough to make a career out of it. Now I have my own photography studio and I'm happy with my choice.'

'I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because they do fun activities like camping and sailing, and teach skills like public speaking. I had never done these things before, so I thought it would be a great opportunity. The NYC has different levels, from beginner to advanced, and each level is run by an adult volunteer leader. When you finish a level, you get a certificate. When I started, my leader suggested I help at a local children's club for two hours a week. I wasn't sure at first, but I decided to do it because I wanted my first certificate. It turned out to be really fun, and soon I wanted to spend all my free time there. I even got to keep helping at the club after I finished the challenge. Now I go there for four hours a week and love it. Because of this experience, I've decided to study to become a youth worker when I finish school. I never thought about this job before, but now it seems like a great career. I've also improved my communication skills and helped others at the same time. I've got several NYC certificates now, including one for camping!'

Janine Stuart wrote a book called Being Amelia when she was just 13 years old. The book became a bestseller. Janine says that her own life was an inspiration for the book. When she was a child, her family moved a lot because of her father's job. She had to make new friends often and understand what it's like to be the only new student in a class. This experience helped her write about the main character Amelia's first day at a new school.

The book is also about Amelia's family and her relationship with her older brother. Janine didn't have a brother, so she had to use her imagination to write about it. She wrote the book during a summer holiday when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a writer, and her teachers encouraged her to write too. Janine had already won a writing competition the year before, so when she finished Being Amelia, she sent it to a publishing company. They loved it and published it a year later.

Some people who reviewed the book said that it's not just a happy story, but also deals with some difficult challenges. They think Janine is a very good writer, even though she's still very young. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer, but she says that she just likes to hang out with her friends and get inspiration from her experiences.

He works for a company that looks after old buildings and keeps them open to the public. We were a bit worried about moving to the island because there's no school here. But we got used to it quickly. The castle is okay, but our flat is comfortable. In the summer, many people visit the island and we have parties on the beach. In the winter, we only see the other families who live here, and there aren't many teenagers. The adults help each other and work together to fix things on the island. The biggest change for me was traveling to school every day by boat. I like the boat rides, especially on calm days. But sometimes I miss the last ferry home if I'm late. When my friends come to visit, I tell them to hurry up! The views are amazing, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Sometimes it's foggy, but then the sun comes out again.

My parents taught me how to tell the difference between birds and where to find them. It was amazing! After that, I joined a local birdwatching club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species. I've almost reached my goal because I've seen birds from other countries when I travel with my family. We look for places where we can see birds together. Last summer, we went to South America, but I didn't see my 200th bird. It was okay because I learned that you have to be patient when watching birds. I shared a video about my challenge on the internet, and many people liked it. My teachers asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I was a bit nervous, but I did well and my teachers were happy. I might do another presentation next year! I'm lucky to live in the countryside because there are many birds to see. I think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby.

I wanted to play professionally. I played in local tournaments and a referee noticed me. He told the manager of a professional women's team to watch me play. She was impressed and asked me to join her team. I was surprised because I didn't know girls could play for a women's team. I started training with the team when I was 13. I got better and better. People weren't sure if I would be a star player, which made me feel a bit sad. But my coach encouraged me to believe in myself. He even let me play in a big match, earlier than I expected. I was so nervous, but I scored the winning goal! The team carried me around the pitch. It was amazing! Since then, I've scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament for teenagers. We want to get them interested in football and show them what it's like to play for a top team.

Research is an important part of learning and working. It's not just for experts or famous scientists, but for everyone. Research helps us build knowledge and skills. It's a way of thinking about the world and doing our own work.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions and finding answers. You don't just memorize information, you make it. To research, you ask questions like ""Why?"", ""How?"", ""What if?"", and ""What does it mean?""

Research can be big and complex, or small and everyday. Some people think it's only for experts, but it's actually a natural part of learning and working. You've probably been doing research without realizing it, like when you ask questions about something you don't understand or try to find the best way to do something.

At college and university, you're expected to be curious and ask questions. You should think critically about what you read and hear, and not just accept what others say. You need to be able to evaluate information and think about whether it's true or not.

It's important to be critical and not just believe everything you read or are told. You need to think about whether the information is logical and backed by evidence. This is important not just for research, but for your whole life and career.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B1 on the CEFR:

Cities have always been important for learning and creativity. In the past, people would gather in coffee shops in cities like London and Paris to discuss new ideas. However, city life can be challenging. The same coffee shops that inspired creativity also spread diseases like cholera. Pablo Picasso, the famous artist, even left the city to live in the countryside.

Scientists are now studying how cities affect our brains. They have found that city life can make us less clever and more tired. One reason for this is that cities lack something that is good for our brains: nature. Studies have shown that when people can see trees or plants, they recover faster from illnesses. Even just looking at nature for a short time can help our brains work better.

Most people now live in cities, which is a big change from the past. Instead of living in the countryside, we are surrounded by many people and buildings. This can affect our mental and physical health, and how we think. When we walk in a city, we have to pay attention to many things, like other people and cars. This can be tiring for our brains.

Scientists have found that cities are too busy and overwhelming for our brains. We need to constantly focus on what is important and ignore what is not. This takes a lot of energy and effort. Natural places, on the other hand, don't require as much mental effort. This is called attention restoration theory.

Some people think that being in nature can help our brains rest and work better. This idea was first suggested by a psychologist named Stephen Kaplan. He believed that being in nature can help our brains recover from the stress of city life.

Philosophers and architects have been warning about the effects of city life for a long time. They have been looking for ways to include more nature in cities. Parks and green spaces can help people escape the stress of city life and improve their brain function.

Some people have been searching for ways to improve their brains, such as taking energy drinks or changing their work environment. However, taking a walk in nature may be the most effective way to improve cognitive performance.

Despite the challenges of city life, cities continue to be important for creativity and innovation. The crowded streets and many people in cities can actually help stimulate creativity and innovation. This is because the concentration of people and ideas can lead to new discoveries and inventions.

The key is to find a balance between the benefits and challenges of city life. We need to find ways to mitigate the negative effects of city life while still enjoying its benefits.<|eot_id|>"

'Where do we find the mind? This might seem like a strange question. We often think that thinking happens inside our heads. But I think we should look beyond the skin and the skull. There is a lot of evidence that shows that things, not just our brains, are involved in our thinking. From ancient times to the present day, we have found many examples of how objects, like stones, have helped humans think and learn. 

It's easy to understand why we often think of the mind and the brain as the same thing. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people who are alone, without their usual surroundings. But this means we often forget that our thinking can happen outside our heads. I'm not saying that the brain isn't important, but I think we should consider the idea that our minds are more than just our brains. 

Instead, I suggest we explore the idea that our intelligence is connected to the world around us. This is where my new theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), comes in. MET looks at how objects become part of our thinking and how they help us learn. It also examines how this has changed over time and what it means for how we think. 

For example, think of a blind person using a stick. Where does their self begin? The stick becomes part of their body, and they use it to'see' the world. This shows us that our minds are always changing and adapting to new things. 

I believe that our minds are unfinished and always evolving. We use objects to help us understand the world and to make sense of things. This is why humans make things, and those things in turn shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds are flexible and change as we interact with the world. 

I want to show how important it is to consider the role of objects in our thinking. MET offers a new way of understanding how different objects, from ancient stones to modern smartphones, have helped shape our minds and how we think.'

'Photography has changed the way we see the world. In the United States, it became an important part of American culture, not just in science and art, but also in everyday life. Historians say that photography is the country's most significant contribution to the visual arts. This is because photography has become a central part of American intellectual and artistic discussions. To understand its impact, we need to look at its beginnings in the 19th century.

So, why was photography so popular? Firstly, it was a mechanical process that matched the American enthusiasm for technology. Just as new technologies like steam power and electricity made the world smaller, photography brought the world into people's homes. Secondly, the camera was a way to show people how they looked, and Americans were interested in presenting themselves to the public. Thirdly, the camera was important for creating and sharing memories of families and personal experiences.

Photographs are unique because they are records of real events, people, and things. They can be objective, but they also have a personal perspective. When we look at a photograph, we might think we know what it means, but its meaning can be influenced by the context in which we see it. To understand a photograph, we need to consider its purpose, the culture it was made in, and how people saw it. The same image can have different meanings in different places and times.

Photography has become an important part of art, and many artists now use photographs in their work. In fact, photography has become an essential part of how we represent the world.'

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for learners of English at the B1 level:

William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the'science of mental life' in 1890. This definition is still relevant today. We all have thoughts and feelings, and we know what it means to have a mental life. However, psychology is a complex subject that can be difficult to understand. James believed that psychology involves three main elements: thoughts and feelings, the physical world, and our way of understanding these things. Each of us has our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and these can influence our understanding of the world. This means that we can make judgments about psychological issues based on our own experiences, but this can also lead to misunderstandings.

Psychologists try to find answers to psychological questions by studying people's behavior and using scientific methods. They want to understand what is happening inside our minds and how it affects our behavior. However, it is difficult to study the mind directly, so psychologists use indirect methods, such as observing people's behavior and making educated guesses about what is happening inside their minds.

Psychology is a challenging subject because it is hard to prove or disprove scientific facts about the mind. Psychologists have to be careful when making observations and drawing conclusions. They use scientific methods to study the mind and develop theories about how it works. The goal of psychology is to understand the mind and use this knowledge to help people in their daily lives.

Psychological research has many practical applications, such as helping children learn to read, designing safer machines, and treating people who are emotionally distressed. Despite the challenges, psychologists continue to study the mind and develop new theories and methods to help us better understand ourselves and others.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level B1 on the CEFR:

""In a special warehouse in Michigan, USA, there is a collection of products that did not sell well. This collection is called the Museum of Failed Products. The owner of the museum, Carol Sherry, thinks that each product has a sad story behind it. The museum is interesting because it is a successful business. Many companies do not keep track of their failed products, but Carol Sherry's collection is a reminder that many products do not succeed.

The museum's owner, Robert McMath, started collecting products in the 1960s. He wanted to have a library of consumer products, not just failed ones. However, most of the products he collected were unsuccessful. This is because many products do not sell well.

The culture of optimism might be responsible for this. Companies often invest more money in a product even if it is not doing well. This is because they do not want to admit that the product is a failure. They also do not want to talk about what went wrong.

The concept of 'positive visualisation' is popular in the self-help industry. This means that if you imagine something going well, it is more likely to happen. However, research suggests that this is not always true. In fact, thinking about how well something could go can actually make people less motivated to achieve their goals.

Psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that people's experiences of failure are influenced by their beliefs about ability. Some people believe that ability is fixed, while others believe it can be developed through hard work and challenge. People who believe that ability is fixed are often very upset when they fail, while those who believe it can be developed see failure as an opportunity to learn and grow.""

""Sports teams usually do better when they play at home. But why is this? Many people think it's obvious, but things are changing in sports and we need to think again. Scientists and people who make money from sports are looking at this question. They want to know what makes players perform well and how to explain the advantage of playing at home. Some people think that if players are paid well, they should feel comfortable anywhere. But what about the fans? Would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some of their home games in a different country? It would matter to the fans who love their team and want them to do well.

We often think that something happens because of what we see, not because of what really happened. When a team scores a goal, the fans cheer loudly. But what about all the times when the team didn't score? We remember the cheering, not the times when it didn't happen. Home fans often shout at the referee, trying to help their team. In a study, referees watched a game with and without crowd noise. The ones who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This is because referees don't want to make decisions that will make the crowd angry.

Studying home advantage over time shows that it's not as big as it used to be. In the past, home teams won 70% of the time, but now it's 60%. This might be because travel used to be harder, but now players are treated well and have good hotels. The stadiums are also similar now. But none of these reasons really explains why home advantage is different in different sports. Basketball is the sport where home advantage is biggest, followed by football. Baseball is the sport where home advantage is smallest. This might be because baseball is more about individual players, not teams working together. Team sports are about working together, and playing at home makes teams feel more confident. There's also a possibility that playing at home is connected to a natural desire to defend our territory, like in the old days of rugby.

Players' testosterone levels are higher before home matches, which might be connected to this territorial feeling. This is a natural instinct to defend our home turf. As one referee said, 'It's the law of the jungle out there.'""

'Gary Player, a famous golfer, once said, ""The more I practice, the luckier I get."" This phrase is well-known among athletes and coaches. It's easy to understand why. The quote is often debated, and its meaning is not clear. Player didn't mean he was lucky; he was being ironic. He meant that the more he practices, the better he gets. But where does this idea stop? Is there a limit to how much practice is needed? This is the heart of the debate about whether talent is born or acquired.

Psychologist Anders Ericsson thinks that with 10,000 hours of practice, anyone can become an expert in a field. Many books agree with him, saying that practice is more important than natural talent. However, a new book challenges this idea. The author, Epstein, argues that it's not that simple. He thinks that the way we look at successful people is wrong. We often focus on the successful ones and try to figure out why they're successful, but we don't consider other factors.

Epstein travels around the world to find answers. He visits Kenya, Sweden, and Alaska, and even looks at animals like sled dogs. He finds that some animals have a natural drive to work hard, which might be related to their genes. This makes him wonder if people's drive is also partly genetic.

Epstein says that both nature (our genes) and nurture (our environment) are important. He doesn't dismiss the importance of practice or environment, but he also thinks that some people might have a natural advantage. He looks at cases where genes play a big role and also discusses the difference between men and women in sports. He asks, ""If practice is the only thing that matters, why do we separate men and women in competitions?"" Sometimes the best questions are the most obvious ones.'

Many children in rich countries feel unhappy and lonely. Jay Griffiths, a writer, wants to know why. She thinks that children are spending too much time indoors, staring at screens, and not enough time playing outside in nature. This is the main problem, she says. Many people agree with her. A recent study asked children what they would like to do to be happier. Most of them said they would like to spend more time outside. Older people often remember their own childhoods fondly, when they were free to explore and play outside. They think this is better than the protected life children have now. However, they rarely think about how they are responsible for the changes they see in children's lives. They are the ones who are keeping their own children safe at home, worried about the dangers outside.

Griffiths also talks about how parents' fears of danger are making them buy more toys and gadgets for their children to keep them entertained at home. She is critical of this and also of the way some schools are prescribing medicine for children who are restless or making them wear protective gear for playground games. Griffiths is a passionate writer who wants children to have more freedom and autonomy. She thinks they should be allowed to take risks and learn from their mistakes. However, she doesn't explain how to achieve this or consider that not all children want to take risks. What about the children who are naturally shy or cautious? Maybe the biggest problem is that we are forcing all children to fit into the same mold, whether by keeping them safe at home or pushing them to be more adventurous.

'I'm a psychologist who has studied a lot. I'm good at solving problems, but this skill doesn't come from school. Most problems in life can't be solved with just a formula or memorized answers. They require common sense, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. Children learn these skills through play. In fact, all mammals, including humans, play when they're young. The more they have to learn, the more they play. Children have a lot to learn, so they play a lot. Play is a natural way for adults and animals to learn. The most important skills children need to learn are those that can't be taught in school. These skills are learned through play, such as thinking creatively, getting along with others, and controlling their emotions. Creativity is important for success. We need people who can think creatively and solve new problems. This requires the ability to think creatively. The creative mind is a playful mind. Adults who are good at thinking creatively are those who retain their childlike curiosity throughout their lives. We can't teach creativity, but we can discourage it by focusing too much on what children should learn, rather than what they're interested in. It's more important for children to learn how to get along with others and work together. Children are naturally social and learn these skills through play. Play is voluntary, so children are free to stop if they want to. This freedom makes play a democratic activity. Unfortunately, school has become more stressful, and children don't have as much time for play as they used to. We need to give children more freedom to play and explore, so they can grow into strong, capable adults.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Reduced the use of complex vocabulary and sentence structures
* Removed or simplified technical terms and jargon
* Added transitional phrases and connecting words to improve cohesion
* Changed some abstract concepts to more concrete examples
* Removed some sentences that were not essential to the main message
* Simplified the language used to describe complex ideas, such as creativity and problem-solving

'Many young people in their twenties are using social media to look for a job. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers. However, with this increased access comes a higher chance of making mistakes. A recent example is a young jobseeker who contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. The executive was not impressed and sent a harsh rejection message that went viral. This incident highlights the importance of using social media correctly when looking for a job. Many young people are not aware of the differences between using social media for personal and professional purposes.

When we were teenagers, social media was a way to escape from our parents and teachers. We used it to impress our friends and create a fantasy world. But when it comes to using social media for job hunting, it's a different story. We need to be professional and respectful. We need to remember that just because someone likes our posts on Facebook, it doesn't mean they will like our LinkedIn profile.

Employers often complain that young jobseekers on professional networking sites are too familiar and come across as arrogant. This can damage our chances of getting a job. To avoid this, we should introduce ourselves clearly, explain what we can offer, and be humble. We should not send impersonal emails and should be careful not to make a bad impression. Social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but we need to use it wisely.'

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at the B1 level:

Newspapers are in trouble. Their circulation has been falling since 2000. In the US, only 26% of people get their news from newspapers, compared to 45% in 2001. Many experts predict that newspapers will disappear within 15 years. However, old media have a way of surviving. For example, books, theatre, and cinema all survived the rise of new media. Radio and vinyl records have also made a comeback.

Newspapers were once new media too. They became popular in the 19th century with the invention of the steam press, the railway, and the telegraph. People needed up-to-date news, and newspapers provided it. However, the idea of needing regular news updates is a relatively new concept. In the past, people only needed to know about major events like famines, floods, or diseases.

Journalism as a profession is also a recent development. Before the 19th century, news was mostly spread through word of mouth or written letters. There was no need for regular news updates, and people didn't expect it.

Now, with the internet, people can get news whenever they want. They can search for specific topics and get instant updates. This is different from traditional newspapers, which had to publish news at a set time and had limited space. Online news can also be corrected quickly if there are errors or misconceptions.

Despite these changes, many news providers are still focused on being the first to break the news, rather than providing in-depth analysis and understanding. Perhaps they will learn to use the internet to guide people to wisdom and understanding.

'If we were meant to live in the dark, we would be happy to do so. But we are creatures that thrive in the light of day. Our bodies are adapted to living in the sun's light, even though we don't think about it much. We have managed to control the night by adding artificial light. This has some good effects, but also some bad ones. The bad effects are called light pollution. Light pollution is when we use too much light and it shines upwards into the sky, instead of just where we need it. This can affect many living things, including us. For most of human history, we didn't have much artificial light, so we didn't have light pollution. Imagine walking in London at night in the 1800s - it was very dark. We have lit up the night like it's an empty space, but it's not empty. Many animals are active at night, and light affects them a lot. Some birds get attracted to artificial light and fly into buildings or get caught in searchlights. Some birds even sing at the wrong times because of artificial light. We used to think light pollution only affected astronomers, but it affects us all. Darkness is important for our health and well-being. If we don't get enough darkness, our bodies don't work properly. We need darkness to sleep and wake up at the right times. So, light pollution is like a problem that affects our whole lives. We have cut ourselves off from our natural world and forgotten our place in the universe.'

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level B1:

'The boss of a big company has announced that they will no longer keep track of how many holidays their employees take. This decision was inspired by a company that already has a similar policy. The boss says that his idea came from an email from his daughter, but some people think it was actually written by someone from his team. The company with 2,000 employees and the big company with 50,000 employees are very different. The smaller company has a single service, while the big company has many different services like banking, transportation, and healthcare. The idea of taking as much time off as you want if it won't harm the business might work for a small company, but it's not suitable for a big company like this one.

The boss says that employees can take as much leave as they want as long as they're sure it won't harm the business or their careers. But it's hard to be 100% sure about this. Even if you prepare well for a holiday, there's always a lot of work to come back to. This is the nature of taking time off. People might not take holidays at all or feel guilty about taking them. This could lead to stress and a decrease in productivity.

In a big company, there's already pressure to work late and start early. This could become even worse if people feel they can't take holidays. They might feel they're not entitled to take time off and might not take it. The policy could also lead to people feeling like they're not allowed to take holidays, even though they're entitled to them. This could make people feel stuck and unable to take the time off they need.

Modern technology has made it easy to work from anywhere, which has blurred the line between work and free time. The company that started this policy did it because they wanted to make it fair. They said that if they can't track how many hours people work, they shouldn't track how many hours they're away from work. However, this means that all hours could be working hours, and employees might feel like they're always being watched. This could be bad for their mental and physical health.

Employment laws exist for a reason. People need time off to rest and relax, which is important for their well-being. I'm not sure if this policy will really help people take more holidays or if it's just a way to make them work more.'

'Scientific research papers are reviewed by experts in the same field to make sure they are accurate and trustworthy. This process is important, but it can take a long time. Some people think that publishing papers online without reviewing them first could be a good idea. This is called a preprint. It allows scientists to share their research quickly and get feedback from others. This is important because it helps to speed up the process of discovering new things.

However, some scientists are worried that publishing papers without reviewing them first could lead to bad research being published. But so far, this hasn't happened. In fact, preprints can be very helpful because they allow scientists to share their work and get feedback from others. This can help to improve the quality of the research.

Some scientists are also worried about the pressure to publish their research in top journals. This can lead to scientists cutting corners and not sharing all of their results. Preprints can help to reduce this pressure and focus on the research itself rather than where it is published.

Overall, preprints can be a useful way for scientists to share their research and get feedback from others. It can help to speed up the process of discovering new things and improve the quality of the research.'

When I ask my students what a poem is, they usually say it's like a painting with words. But I'm not satisfied with that answer. So, I asked them to write a paragraph describing an object, like a scientist would, and another paragraph from the object's point of view, called a 'Poem'. One student wrote about an oxygen mask. It's a strange choice, but it helped us understand how poetry is special.

When I was at school, I didn't like poetry. I thought it was confusing and didn't make sense. After school, most people don't think about poetry much. Sometimes you see a poem and it's different from normal writing. It's like a challenge, and you read it to see what it's about. But often, you might not understand it or find it boring. People usually look for poems to make them feel something, to see beautiful images, or to think deeply. But we can find those things in other things, like films or music.

So, what is a poem? Some people say it's like a puzzle, but it's not just that. A poem can be like a special kind of tool that helps us understand the world better. We can find poems in books, magazines, or online. They're different from other writing because they're not just for entertainment or information. Poems can surprise us, even if it's just for a moment.

Here is the simplified text for a B1 level learner:

I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It was £70, which was a lot of money then. My wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip out. Over the years, every coin and brooch I've found has given me pleasure. But it wasn't until 40 years later that I found something that impressed Marion as much as the gold ring.

One rainy afternoon, I went to a spot I knew had old farming equipment. My detector beeped, and I found a piece of a metal wheel. Then it beeped again. I dug down half a meter and found a golden ball. I thought it might be a piece of brass, but as I cleaned it, it became clear it was a beautiful, intricately patterned loop. I'd seen something like this before - the Great Torc, on display at the British Museum. It's a famous necklace from over 2,000 years ago.

I took the torc home and showed it to Marion. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. I hid it in our wardrobe, but I was worried about it getting stolen. Eventually, I hid it in my office under a floorboard. The law says that finds like this must be reported to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy it first, so I took it to show a friend in hospital. Then I took it to the council office. The torc was authenticated and sold to my local council. The money was split between the owner of the field and me. The torc is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 we got was a surprise, but the torc has been more than just a lucky find. It's something I've saved for everyone.

People ask me if I'll stop detecting now, but I won't. I'll keep searching for more treasures. If a fisherman catches a big fish, he doesn't stop fishing - he keeps trying to catch an even bigger one.

'Sleep is one of my favourite things to do when I travel. But I don't often talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their exciting trips, where they do lots of things every day, I smile and don't say much. I think they would be surprised if they knew that my travel plans include taking long naps in the afternoon and sleeping in late in the morning. Sleeping is one of the best things about traveling. When I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast when I was 20, I slept for more than 12 hours a day. It was amazing! The noise from the birds outside didn't bother me. I was far from home, but I felt very relaxed and slept better than I do at home. When I'm traveling, I think sleep is a way to process all the new things I'm experiencing. When I'm in a new place, I feel like I'm taking in so many new sights, sounds, and smells. It's when I sleep that I can make sense of it all. Travel sleep is also different from sleep at home. It's like my body adjusts to the new place and its rhythms. For example, when I was in Trinidad, people woke up early in the morning, took a nap in the middle of the day, and then went out in the evening. It took me a few days to get used to this new routine. When I finally adjusted, I felt like I was really part of the place. Travel sleep is special because it's something I remember. When I'm in a new place, I notice all the little things that I wouldn't normally notice, like the smells and sounds of my surroundings. If you're a slow traveler, like me, you might think that sleep is an important part of the experience. Maybe I should stop feeling guilty about my love of sleep and tell my friends that it's an important part of traveling too.'

But this little hat will make me stand out.' She patted the small red and black hat on her head. 'Yes, this is the one I want.'

Mia knew she couldn't change the woman's mind, so she smiled and agreed that the hat would make her stand out. Mia was thinking about her own daughter, Jen, who was turning 30 today. They were having a family gathering, and Mia was looking forward to seeing her and her husband, Dan, and their son, Luke. She was also excited to meet the friend Jen was bringing, named Tattie. Mia's husband, Jeff, didn't like the name Tattie and thought it was too fancy. He also didn't like it when Mia was too polite and didn't speak her mind.

Although he had never played football before, he is likely to be chosen for a big team. Lawrence is still learning about his new position.

It's surprising that a 21-year-old from London might play for a top team in the US, but Lawrence is used to doing the unexpected. He had a chance to study law at Oxford University, but he decided to focus on discus instead. After just 20 months, he became the world's fourth-best discus thrower.

Lawrence originally went to Atlanta for warm-weather training for discus. He wanted to be ready for the world championships. But when he got to the US, he decided to try out for football. He had thought about it before, but it seemed crazy at the time. After arriving in America, he read about the NFL's trials in Atlanta and decided to apply. He didn't think he would be good enough, but he went for it.

Lawrence is not nervous about trying out with experienced players. He's not a nervous person. He did well in the tests and drills, and the coaches were impressed. He's proud of himself, but also knows he has a lot to learn.

Lawrence is unsure if he will be selected for the team. He's not putting too much pressure on himself. He's had some setbacks, like finishing last in the Olympic discus final, but he's moved on. He's happy to have qualified for the final and is looking forward to the next challenge.

I shook my head. My neighbour, Sergei, woke up and smiled at me. He was a salesman from Moscow who was flying to a remote area to sell safety clothes to mining companies. His English was not very good, but I explained to him that I was going to Magadan, a city in eastern Siberia, with only a one-way ticket. I wanted to cycle back to England. Sergei was surprised and said, 'But there's no road from Magadan. You can't cycle.' I told him that I thought there was a road, even if not many people used it. He asked if I was going alone, and I said yes, just with my friend Al. He looked unconvinced and said 'Holodna' (cold). I showed him that I had warm clothes, but didn't mention that I was on a tight budget. I had bought most of my clothes and equipment at a discount.

It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. The room was full of students, but they were all tired. The lecturer was talking, but I was thinking about a problem. Should I ask him or not? I wrote a note to Al, my old friend, asking if he wanted to cycle across the Karakorum Highway in Pakistan and China that summer. He agreed, and it was six years later that I was going to join him in Siberia.

'The Red Bull Air Race is a thrilling competition where 12 pilots fly their planes through a course of 15-25 metre high pylons. They do sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to try it out. Before the flight, I had to sign two forms. One was to confirm my good health, and the other was to empty my pockets because small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I also learned that I had to stay focused and look at the horizon to stay orientated. The pilot told me to relax and enjoy the view when we were flying upside down.

When we were about to take off, I was given a safety briefing. I was told not to touch anything in the plane. As we taxied down the runway, I felt a bit nervous. I was asked to promise that I would stay calm and focused during the flight. This is the challenge of high-speed flying - you have to stay calm to survive.

When we took off, we banked sharply to the right. It was a sudden and violent movement, and I felt the air squeeze out of my lungs. I looked up at the horizon and felt my stomach drop. We did some more sharp turns and dives, and I felt my stomach lurch. Then, I got to fly the plane for a few minutes. It was very responsive, but my hands were shaking a lot.

After that, the pilot asked me if I was okay. I said yes, but I was really scared. He did some more tricks, like a barrel roll and a loop. I was getting a bit overwhelmed. At the top of the loop, I heard the pilot telling me to relax. When I looked up, I saw some fields. The flight was over after 10 minutes. It was a lot more intense than what the pilots do in the competition. After we landed, the pilot had a snack, but I didn't eat for hours.

Doug showed them around and realized that filming wildlife was his dream job. He loves traveling, adventure, and underwater filming.

Doug has worked on many big TV wildlife series. He is good at filming in cold places. When he started, not many people had filmed in Antarctica. He was one of the first. Now, it's easier to film with digital technology. He can shoot a lot of footage and look at it right away. Before, he had to think carefully about what shots he needed and what he might miss. Film was expensive, so he shot less.

Doug has a lot of experience filming in cold conditions. He knows how to handle it. He has spent a lot of time on sea ice. It's like crossing the street for him now. He gets cold toes, but the polar regions are healthy places. There are no mosquitoes or diseases.

Filming wildlife can be very successful, but also very difficult. Sometimes things don't go as planned. Doug once got lost in the Orkneys while filming birds. He didn't know what kind of birds they were. Recently, he filmed polar bears in the Arctic Ocean. It was a challenging assignment. He walked for hours every day and waited for polar bears for 23 days. On the 24th day, he finally saw a mother bear and her cub. He was very excited.

He made a mistake last time he went away and told his son to take care of his mother and sister, but it was too much for the boy.

Pen is going to the Arctic with two colleagues, Ann and Martin, and they will be supported by a team of six people who will bring them supplies. Pen is a bit worried about the trip because he hasn't trained as much as he would like, but he's excited to be doing something important for science.

'I took a year off after being a successful Olympian. I did some writing, TV work, and spoke to businesses and schools. But I missed the competition and wanted to stay in shape. So, I started doing marathons and triathlons. Then, I received an invitation from TV presenter Ben Fogle to row across the Atlantic with him. I loved rowing, but I wasn't sure if I was ready to train every day. I asked some rowing friends if they wanted to join, but they weren't interested. Ben had already paid for the boat and entry fee, so we decided to do it together. We had to pay £70,000 for the boat and equipment. I also had to think about the money I would lose by being away from home. As a retired athlete, I usually make money by speaking at business conferences. But I wanted to do something new and exciting. Rowing across the Atlantic would be a big challenge and a great experience. I learned a lot while preparing for the race, but I also realized how much I took for granted the easy life of a professional athlete.

'A year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in Finland. I was 26 and felt restless. I wanted to experience the Arctic landscape, which was very different from my life in London. I found a small company in Finnish Lapland that took tourists on dog sled rides across the snow and ice. They had six dogs at first, but soon had over 100. I joined the team for three months. They warned me that the work would be hard and physical. 

When I arrived, I was given a list of over 100 husky names to remember. But I was too distracted to focus. Instead, I looked out the window and saw the winter landscape. 

The bus ride to the farm was long and dark. We drove through forests with snow-covered trees. When I arrived, I was given a pair of boots and told to go outside into the cold. 

The dogs were excited and barking loudly. I followed the noise and saw people harnessing the dogs to sleds. I was a bit lost, but someone gestured for me to get on a sled. We went out into the dark with only a head torch for light. 

After a few days, I was asked if I was useful. I didn't know. I had never driven a snowmobile, done woodwork, or chopped wood with an axe. But I had a driving licence. 

It was hard to learn how to take care of the dogs and drive the sleds. Simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs were difficult in the cold weather. But I was proud of myself for learning to chop wood and use tools in the snow. '<|eot_id|>"

'When Paula Radcliffe finished the marathon, the press was surprised. Her time was so good that she could have run in the men's world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about a special oil, emu oil, which helped her heal from an injury. Radcliffe got the injury when she accidentally ran into a bike while training. She said she didn't really think about her achievement at the time. She and her team believed in not setting limits, so she just kept going.

During the race, Radcliffe's coach and husband, Gary Lough, and her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, were following her progress. They were worried that she was going too fast and might get tired. But Hartmann was angry because he knew how fit Radcliffe was. With 800 meters left to run, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she ran fast. She did, finishing in 2 hours and 15 minutes. She thought she could run even faster.

After the race, people asked how she, with her unusual running style, beat the East African runners. Hartmann said he had never worked with anyone who could take as much pain as Radcliffe. He would get hurt after working with her. He would have to go deep into her muscles, and his thumbs would hurt afterwards.

Radcliffe's coach said that she was very demanding and would push him to his limits. Radcliffe thinks that's why no one has beaten her record. She trained hard, but there are more talented runners. She thinks that people should focus on their own goals instead of racing each other. Radcliffe's marathon was her best performance, and she never ran as fast again. However, she inspired many women to start running long distances.'

""When I first made my cookery show 'In Search of Perfection', I wasn't sure how people would react. There was a lot of talk about a food revolution in Britain, and I thought we had made a unique contribution to that. But I was worried: would people like an approach to cooking that included history, memories, and science? I watched the first episode with mixed feelings. I didn't need to worry. The show was a success and led to more projects, including a book about my restaurant. In all my projects, I feel like I'm on a journey - into the past, into people's minds, or into cooking techniques. I wrote several books called 'Perfection', each one linked to a TV show. These books were about traveling and meeting people who are passionate about their work. In my latest book, 'In Search of Total Perfection', I visited many places and met people who spend their lives trying to make things perfect. Perfection is a personal thing. Even choosing which dishes to include in the book was difficult, and I knew I would upset some people by leaving out their favourite dishes. But we worked together to find a list that everyone could agree on. This made me think that each of us has our own idea of what perfection is, based on our own experiences and memories. The book isn't about claiming that the recipes are the best, but about understanding what makes them work. The TV show gave me the chance to try new foods, meet new people, and explore different places. I was excited to do this because it's what I did when I started my career in cooking.""

We were still far from Marrakech when our van broke down. It veered off the road and stopped in a field. John got out and looked under the hood. He was trying to fix it, but he didn't know what he was doing. 'I'm not sure what's wrong,' he said. My sister Bea was worried. 'We can't stay here forever.' The field was big and empty, with just grass and some flowers. 'We can't stay here forever,' I said, agreeing with Bea. We got back in the van and waited for John to find someone who could help us. Mum lay down on the grass and asked me to tell her a story. I told her about two birds I had heard talking in London before we left. They talked about food, other birds, and the weather. They even had an argument over a worm. Bea laughed at me, saying no one understands bird language. I felt sad and unsure. We eventually found three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to a hotel. Bea didn't want to get out, but the boys didn't mind. We had tea in the hotel's café. The tea was very sweet and made from mint leaves. We stayed there all day while John tried to fix the van.

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at a party in the hotel ballroom. One was from Tokyo and the other was from a European city. Lucy didn't catch their names, but they were both older than her. They talked about the music they were playing and where they had been recently. Lucy mentioned that she was going to the Tanglewood festival, which sounded impressive. But she didn't really want to go. She didn't want to miss school and was working with tutors instead.

Lucy's mom had entered her into the Prague Festival without asking her. Lucy didn't want to be disappointed if she didn't get in, so she didn't say no. The guy from Tokyo asked her how old she was, and Lucy told him she was 15. The woman from the European city was surprised. Lucy didn't mean to brag, but it was hard to know how much to share.

Lucy's grandfather came over and took her away from the conversation. He reminded her not to get too friendly with the other pianists, because everyone is competition. Lucy smiled and talked to everyone he introduced her to. After the party, her grandfather told her she did well and that people were talking about her.

'Dad says I spend too much time online. I should get out more. But I wanted to find out what experts think. Most teenagers who use social media have many friends, feel good about themselves, and learn important skills for the digital world. An expert on internet safety says social networking is just part of modern life. It's like hanging out at a youth club, where you share jokes and gossip with friends. A psychologist says social media helps you figure out who you are and how to deal with problems. It's also good for shy people, as they can practice social skills in a comfortable way.

Another expert says social media is like a virtual youth club, where you can find people with the same interests. You can share your hobbies and discover what you enjoy. Research shows that people who use social media a lot are not as self-centered as those who don't use it.

A digital education expert says that social media can help you find new interests, join groups of like-minded people, and even create your own content. This can be useful in the future, when you're looking for a job. Every company uses social media to sell and promote their brand, and you need to know how it works. If you have 1000 friends on different social networks, they can be potential customers for your products.

Experts agree that using social media creatively will help you in the future. You can work with others to create content and share it with others. This is an important skill for the 21st century and can help you get a job.'

'When most people think of a family holiday, they don't usually imagine a long road trip across nine American states and one Canadian province. But my parents had other ideas. They wanted to plan a special trip for us to spend time together as a family. My dad seemed to enjoy planning the trip, but my brother and I were not too excited. We were worried about being away from home for two weeks and not having our own space.

We packed our bags and set off on our adventure. We drove west through Oklahoma, where we had some exciting experiences. We stopped for the night in a small town under the stars, but we almost got blown off the road in a strong wind storm. We learned that we had to be careful and respect the rules of the road, especially when we saw cattle on the highway.

The next day, we continued our journey. We saw beautiful mountains and went to the Great Sand Dunes. We also visited Pagosa Springs in Colorado, where we smelled the strong smell of sulfur. We had to be careful when driving on mountain roads and sometimes had to wait in traffic. We saw many wind farms and eventually arrived at Yellowstone National Park, where we watched the sunset over the bear habitats.

We had some unexpected surprises, like seeing a bear on the road and having to stop for a while. We stayed in a small hotel with no internet or phone signal, but we enjoyed the beautiful views. After a while, we headed back home, and it was nice to be together again. We took many photos during our trip and will always remember the fun times we had.'

Now, her book is almost ready to be published. When she told her old teacher about it, the teacher was surprised. She thought Charlotte would write a book when she was much older.

Charlotte's book is very good. It's a big achievement for a 15-year-old. The story is exciting and well-written. Charlotte is proud of herself, but she knows that being young can also be a limitation. She talks about the moral issues in her book and says that she was trying to ask big questions, not answer them.

Charlotte thinks that many books about teenagers are not realistic. They often show teenagers as outsiders, or as people who don't know much about the world, or as awkward and socially unskilled. Charlotte thinks that this is not true for many teenagers. She wants to show that teenagers can be normal and fine, and that they don't have to be inadequate in some way.

Charlotte has always liked reading fantasy books, but some of them made her feel like she couldn't write a good book. However, she liked a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which gave her some good advice. Charlotte's parents are both journalists, which helped her get her book published.

""Remember, speed is important, not scary,' said Gareth, our teacher, as we looked at the big hill. 'Who wants to go first?' We all looked nervous. Then one person, David, who had some experience with freestyle skiing, went first. He went down the hill fast and jumped high, but didn't land well. He fell and lost his skis. 'Remember, speed can be unpredictable,' Gareth said. I had never tried freestyle skiing before. I liked skiing, but I didn't like trying new and difficult things. My parents decided we would go to a special ski center in the US where we could learn freestyle skiing. The center had a big indoor area with trampolines and artificial snow. We could practice our moves there before going outside. The slogan at the center said, 'Progression is inevitable!' Gareth told us that before this center, people would just go down the hill and hope they didn't get hurt. But now, we could learn how to do it safely. He also warned us about the 'knuckle', which is the flat part of the hill before the slope gets steeper. If we land on the knuckle, it can be painful. So, we need to go fast. At first, it was hard for me to go fast and not be scared. My legs would stop moving when I got close to the jump, and I would fall. But Gareth told us to control the jump, not let it control us. On the second day, we started on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being inside, looking at the snow outside, but it was fun! We did some exercises to help us learn how to ski-jump and some to help us understand what we were doing in the air. Gareth gave us feedback and told us what we were doing wrong. We went back to the mountain to try again. It took some time, but I finally landed properly. Gareth was happy and I was proud of myself. But then, on the last run of the day, I lost my skis again!""

Miranda Ellington is a successful choreographer. She is 25 years old and has already worked with many theaters and dance companies. She also still dances sometimes. I'm curious to know why she does both jobs. 'As a dancer, I remember how it feels to take orders from choreographers and how stressful it can be. Choreographers often forget what it's like to rehearse all day,' she says.

As a choreographer, Miranda enjoys working with young students. 'They are open to new ideas and willing to take risks. They don't know what they're good at or bad at, so they listen to my feedback. Sometimes they disagree with me, but I like their honest opinions.'

When Miranda works with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. 'I might not like a piece of music, but I still create a good dance routine for it. If the dancers don't like the music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find a solution. I wish I could choose different music, but that's not usually possible.'

Miranda doesn't like to work with just one group. 'I like to meet new people and work with different groups. Each group has its own way of working, so I have to adapt. That means I don't get stuck in one way of working.'

We talked about a recent documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. 'This documentary shows what life is really like in a dance company. It's not all glamour and fun. There's a lot of hard work and dedication involved in ballet.'

I asked Miranda what makes a great dance production. 'When everything comes together - the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers - it's great. It's not always perfect, but aiming high is important. I've been in productions where the dance was great, but something else wasn't right. That's disappointing.'

Miranda has worked on many different types of dance. I asked if she is a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist. 'People like to put labels on people, but I don't think that's necessary. I want to try new things and work with different groups.'

I fixed the wheels and cables, and wore seatbelts as a backpack. I slept on the sofa every night, even on the beach one night.

I told him I would be joining a group of ten people to swim around the islands. He smiled and showed me on board.

The waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group. But I wanted to finish the swim, and I was happy when I did it on my own. The next days were the same: we'd jump in, swim at a comfortable pace, and stop to look at the beautiful scenery. As the swims got longer, I got faster and more confident.

So, the director had to find twice as many actors in the UK. Luckily, he found many talented actors. The show has been a hit in London, with the theatre full every night. People love the songs that were popular in America. I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He loves playing his guitar and said it's great that he gets paid to do it. He told me that the actors have normal school lessons during the day and miss their old school friends. The theatre offers special deals on tickets for schools, and Jamie's whole class came to see the show. They loved it, and it made Jamie feel proud. When I said I also play guitar, Jamie showed me his spare guitar and we played a song together. I was impressed by his skills and happy to have tried playing with him. The young actors are already good musicians, but none of them had played in a band before. They found it easy to learn, but the hard part was looking natural on stage.
