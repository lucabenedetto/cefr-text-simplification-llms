Here is the simplified text for a learner of level A2 on the CEFR:

'Some people are worried about sharing their whereabouts on the internet. They think that by saying where they are, they are also telling everyone else. This can be a problem because not everyone we meet online is a good person. The internet has many opportunities to share our lives with the world. But sometimes we forget that our online life is connected to our real life. We can say things online that we wouldn't say in person.

A long time ago, some people started sharing their lives online. They were the first bloggers. They shared their thoughts, photos, and stories with the world. They faced many problems, like losing friends and getting into trouble. But they learned from their experiences and warned others about the dangers of sharing too much online.

One of the first bloggers was a young man named Justin Hall. He started sharing his life online in 1994. He wrote about his thoughts, feelings, and experiences. He even shared photos and art. People liked reading about him and started visiting his website. But one day, his website disappeared and he was very sad. He had to take it down because people were saying mean things about him.

Another blogger was Heather Armstrong. She wrote about her job and her life. But one day, someone sent her blog to her boss and she lost her job. This is what can happen when we share too much online. It's important to remember that our online life is connected to our real life. We should think carefully before sharing things online.

Heather Armstrong learned from her experience and started sharing her life again. She wrote about her family and her new life. She became famous as a mommy blogger and now she writes about her family and life. She learned that we can say anything online, but we should think carefully before doing so.'

""Some scientists made a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? It's a mix of documentary and drama. They wanted to show that there's a lot we don't know about the universe. Some scientists thought the movie was wrong and said it was bad. But the movie is interesting. It talks about new discoveries that show the universe is strange. For example, scientists found out that water can change shape because of our thoughts. This is a big claim, but it's not proven. The movie shows some pictures of ice crystals, but scientists need more proof.

Actually, scientists have made many discoveries that show the universe is really strange. They found out that the universe is made of something we don't know about, and it's moving because of a mysterious force. They also found out that our brains take a little time to understand what's happening. And they found out where humans came from and how they spread across the world.

Some scientists are still trying to understand the universe, but it's very hard. They can't know everything. They have to accept that some things will always be a mystery. This is why they're trying to make a special theory that explains everything. For many people, the universe is amazing and incredible.""

Writing novels is difficult, but writing short stories is easy. It's like planting a small garden compared to planting a big forest. Both are important to me. When I finish a novel, I want to write some short stories. When I finish a group of short stories, I want to write a novel. I never write short stories while writing a novel, and never write a novel while writing short stories. This helps me to focus and switch between the two. I started writing short stories in 1984. It was a new experience for me, but I liked it. I felt happy to have more possibilities in my writing. Readers liked my short stories too. One of my early short stories was included in a book called 'Tales from Abroad'. I like writing short stories because they are quick to finish. It usually takes me a week to write a short story. I can finish it and move on. Writing a novel takes a long time, and it can be hard. Writing short stories is a change of pace for me. I can write about small things, like an idea or a word. It's like improvising music. If my idea doesn't work, I don't worry. I can try again. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver don't always write great short stories. I learn from my mistakes and use them to improve my next story. Short stories help me to become a better novelist. They are like small marks I leave behind, and I remember how I felt when I wrote them. Short stories are like a way to share my feelings with readers.

'Science is a way to understand the world around us. It helps us to cure diseases, make our lives easier, and learn about the universe. But science can also be complicated and sometimes fails to answer our questions. It has been used by many people, including poets, politicians, and scientists. Scientists often disagree with each other, and their ideas are not always accepted immediately. Sometimes, old ideas are replaced by new ones, and this can cause controversy.

Science has changed a lot over time. In the past, scientists thought they had already discovered everything, but then new discoveries were made. This has happened many times. Today, scientists are still making new discoveries and trying to understand the universe.

Science is important because it helps us to control nature and make our lives better. But it can also have negative effects if we don't use it wisely. That's why it's important for everyone to understand science and its impact on our world. The decisions we make about science can affect our future and the future of our planet.'

'For some time, people thought that ebooks would be very popular and that print books would disappear. But now, many publishers are saying that ebook sales have stopped growing or are even going down. Some people think that this means ebooks are not as good as they thought they would be. But others still think that ebooks and print books can coexist.

Why do people worry about the future of books? The idea of a new technology replacing an old one is not new. In the past, people thought that radio would replace books, and then television would replace radio. But radio and television are still here.

When a new technology comes out, people often feel excited and a little scared. We form strong connections with things like books, TVs, and computers. When something new comes along, we have to adjust to it and say goodbye to the old way. That's why we often miss the old things and want to go back to them.

The idea of a technology ""killing"" another one is a common story that we tell ourselves. It's a way to understand and make sense of change. It's like a storybook that we use to think about the future and our fears about losing things that are important to us.'

I wrote a book about how famous people spend their daily lives. I wanted to find out how they manage to do their best work. I looked at what they eat, when they sleep, and how they organize their days. I thought that by looking at these small things, I could learn more about their personalities and careers.

The book is not just about the work they do, but also about how they live their daily lives. It's about how they make time for their work and still have a life. I struggled with these same questions in my own life, so I wanted to find out how others deal with them.

I read about many famous people and found out what they do every day. I wanted to show how their daily routines help them be creative and productive. I also wanted to show how their routines can be different from one another, and how they can be good or bad.

Howard became interested in fossils when he was six years old. His family couldn't go on holiday to Spain because of high interest rates. Instead, they went to the beach in England, where Howard found an ammonite. He wanted to be a paleontologist and study ancient creatures. He chose to focus on the earliest fossils, not the big, famous ones like dinosaurs. He worked hard and got his PhD. After that, he was worried about finding a job. He applied for a job at Tavistock College in London, but he didn't think he would get it. The person who was supposed to interview him was late because he had a fight with his wife. Howard's interview went ahead without him, and a colleague who didn't like him got the job. But Howard got the job anyway. He was surprised, but happy to have a job doing what he loved.

Months later, Howard found out that the colleague who got the job didn't want him to get it. Howard was a bit upset, but he was relieved to have the job. He liked the order and routine of his work, but sometimes things didn't go as planned. One day, someone stole his briefcase with his notes for a lecture. He was angry and had to cancel the lecture. Later, he met a colleague who told him about a new collection of fossils at the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard was excited and decided to go to the museum to study the fossils.

'Professor Charles Spence loves to eat different foods. He even eats foods that some people might not like. For example, he eats ice cream made from bee larvae. It tastes a bit sweet and floral.

Professor Spence is a scientist who studies how we experience food and drink. He wants to know how our senses, like taste, smell, and sight, work together to make food taste good or bad. He thinks that things like the color and shape of plates, the noise in the room, and who we eat with can affect how we taste food.

Professor Spence has written a book about his research. He found out some interesting things. For example, the person who orders first at a restaurant usually likes their food the most. And when we eat with other people, we usually eat more than when we eat alone.

Professor Spence's lab is not very high-tech. He uses simple things like paper and drawing pins to do his research. He works with cooks and food companies to help them make healthier food. He thinks it's important to make food that is good for us and tastes good too.

Professor Spence has worked with famous chefs and food companies to help them make changes to their recipes. He thinks that if we know what we're eating, we might not like it as much. So, some companies make changes to their food without telling us.

Professor Spence has also worked with a famous chef to create a special dish that uses sound to make the food taste better. He thinks that music and sound can affect how we taste food. He's even worked with an airline to match music with food they serve to their passengers.'

Our brains are very busy. We get a lot of information, but not all of it is true. We have to sort through it all to find what we need. We're also doing more things on our own, like booking flights and buying things online. We're doing the work of many people, but we're still trying to take care of our lives, families, and jobs. Our smartphones help us do all this. But, we think we're good at doing many things at once, but we're not. Our brains are not good at multitasking. We're really just switching between tasks quickly. This can be stressful and make us less efficient. It's like trying to juggle many balls, but we're not good at it.

We think we're getting a lot done, but we're not. Multitasking makes us less efficient. It can also make us feel stressed and confused. Our brains like new things, so we get distracted easily. This is bad for our brains. It's hard to focus when we have many things to do. Even having the chance to multitask is bad for our brains.

""Do animals have feelings and emotions like humans do? Some scientists used to think not, but now they are starting to study animal behavior and emotions more closely. For example, a chimpanzee in a Swedish zoo broke up concrete to throw at visitors. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other mothers with their babies. Are they being kind?

Fifty years ago, scientists only looked at animal behavior, not their feelings. But now, they are studying emotions in animals like bats, chimpanzees, rats, dolphins, and even chickens. This has started a big debate: can animals really think and feel like humans do?

One scientist, Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, thinks that if animals can solve problems and enjoy it, we should stop eating meat. Another scientist, Professor Aubrey Manning, says we should rethink how we think about animal intelligence. And a third scientist, Professor Euan MacPhail, thinks we should not attribute human thoughts to animals.

The debate is not just about science, but also about ethics and philosophy. Can we really know what it's like to be an animal, like a bat or a cow? Some scientists think we should treat animals with more respect and kindness, while others disagree.

In a recent study, starlings were put in different cages. Some had a lot of space and water, while others were cramped and miserable. The birds in the good cages were happier and healthier, and even seemed to get depressed when they were in the bad cages. This shows that animals can have feelings and emotions, just like humans do.""

'Thinking deeply about what we read or hear is called critical thinking. Adrian West, a researcher, says that technology can help us learn, but it can also make it harder to think deeply. He thinks that we are exposed to a lot of bad ideas and opinions, and this can be confusing. We have a lot of information, but this doesn't always mean we know more or make better decisions.

Reading is important for critical thinking. However, people are reading less and less. This might be because they are spending more time watching TV and playing video games. Patricia Greenfield, a professor, says that reading helps us think deeply and imagine things. Video games and TV can also help us learn, but they don't help us think as much as reading does.

James Paul Gee, a professor, says that video games can be a good way to learn. He thinks that they can help us make good decisions and think critically. Some games, like Sim City and Civilization, teach us how to make choices and solve problems. They also let us explore new ideas and concepts.

Matthew Crawford is a writer who also works as a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office, but he didn't like it. His first book was about the good things about doing manual work. His latest book is about how to live with modern technology.

Crawford noticed that advertisements pop up on our phones and computers all the time. He thinks this is making it hard for us to think and focus. We are constantly being interrupted and it's hard to have a conversation with someone without distractions. We are also losing the ability to do simple things, like talk to strangers.

Crawford thinks that technology is making us more selfish. We are more interested in our own thoughts and desires than in interacting with other people. He gives the example of a gym. In the past, people would listen to music together. Now, everyone listens to their own music on their headphones. This has made the gym less social.

Crawford suggests that we need to find ways to focus on the world around us. He gives the examples of a cook, an ice-hockey player, and a motorbike rider. These people have to deal with real things, not just representations of things. They have to use their judgment and work with others. This makes their experiences more real and satisfying.

Crawford also thinks that it's important to learn to focus on one thing at a time. This can help us focus on what's important and make it easier to talk to others.

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a learner of level A2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR):

'What do you do for a living?' is a common question. But what if you're a philosopher like me? It's hard to explain what I do in just a few words. People often think that philosophers are special or smart, but we're just like everyone else. So, why do people think this?

One reason is that philosophers are known for thinking about big ideas and judging what others do. A long time ago, a famous philosopher named Aristotle said that thinking deeply about life is the most important thing. Many people still think that's true today.

Another reason is that some philosophers, like Socrates, said that we should think about our lives and make our own decisions. This means looking closely at what we do every day and making sure it's important to us. It's not just about reading books or being smart; it's about thinking about our daily lives.

However, many people think that philosophers are not connected to real life. They think we're too busy talking about big ideas to care about what's happening in the world. This is partly because philosophers often write for other experts, not for ordinary people. We need to change this and share our ideas with everyone.

I'm an ethicist, which means I think about what's right and wrong. But I think there's more to philosophy than just deciding what's right or wrong. I want to help people think about their daily lives and behaviors. By doing this, we can learn more about ourselves and the world around us.

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for learners of English at level A2 (CEFR):

Food and eating are important parts of our lives. Many people think that thinking deeply about food can make eating more enjoyable. However, philosophers have not often talked about food in a serious way. When they have, it's usually been as a way to talk about something else. For example, some philosophers have used eating as a metaphor to explain how we learn.

The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus believed that we should try to be happy and avoid pain. He thought this applied to many parts of life, not just eating. Today, his name is often used to sell food and drinks. This is because people think that if something is good enough for philosophers, it must be good for them too.

Food is a social and cultural part of our lives. We don't just eat alone, we eat with others. This is why food is an important topic for philosophers. They can help us think about what we eat and why we eat it.

Some people are very good at writing about food. They can describe what it tastes like. But this is not a special skill, just a good way of using words. Philosophers have not paid much attention to how we taste food. This is strange, because we use our sense of taste all the time.

Food can also be beautiful. Some people think that food should be considered a work of art, like a painting or a piece of music. But food is eaten and then gone, so it can't be appreciated in the same way. There are also important questions about what we should eat. Should we choose food that is good for the environment, or food that is produced in a certain way? These are questions that philosophers can help us answer.

Finally, food can bring people together. Sharing a meal with others can help us understand different cultures and build friendships. This is an important part of diplomacy and international relations. Philosophers can help us think about the role of food in these situations.

Rob Daviau is a game designer from the US. He wanted to make board games more exciting and challenging. He thought, ""Why can't games have a story? Why can't what we do in one game affect the next game?"" He took an old game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. This game is special because what we do in the game can change the game forever. We might have to tear up cards or draw on the board. The game is played over several sessions, and we can see how our choices affect the game. Daviau said, ""You can point to the board and say, 'Look, I did that!'""

Daviau worked on another game called Pandemic. It's a cooperative game where we work together to save the world from diseases. He also made a game called SeaFall. In this game, we are sailors exploring the world in the 16th to 19th centuries. The designer of SeaFall, Rob Daviau, had to think about all the possible choices players could make to make sure the story didn't fall apart. He tested the game with players to see how it would work.

When Daviau started making legacy games, he didn't think it would be popular. He thought it would be a niche thing. But many people loved the idea. One player, Russell Chapman, said it's one of the biggest advances in game design in years. He likes that it's a new level of commitment and excitement. Another player, Ben Hogg, said the appeal of an unfolding adventure is more important than how long the game lasts. He compares it to watching a TV series.

The legacy format is like a video game or a TV show. We're buying into an experience. The game designer, Matt Leacock, compares it to writing a novel. He says you need to have an idea of how you want it to end and a good idea of where you want it to begin. Daviau is happy to see where others take the idea, but he thinks gamers will soon ask for something new.

Colby Dauch, the manager of the publisher of SeaFall, thinks the legacy format has changed the way we think about board games.<|eot_id|>"

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at a zoo in New Zealand. He crawled across the floor and slipped into a drain that led to the ocean. This is a fun story that people liked sharing online. It's fun to imagine that animals are like us, with their own thoughts and feelings. Octopuses are very smart, and they can do many things that seem like magic, like opening jars and recognizing faces. But some scientists think that we often don't give animals enough credit for their intelligence. They think that we should be more open-minded and recognize that animals have their own special ways of thinking.

A long time ago, people used to think that animals were very smart and could even be put on trial for crimes. But then, some scientists started to think that animals were just machines that reacted to things, and they didn't have feelings or thoughts. This changed how people thought about animals and how they treated them. Now, some scientists are starting to think that animals are more like us than we thought. They have their own thoughts and feelings, and they can even learn and remember things in their own way.

The story of Inky the octopus is a good example of how animals are smarter than we think. Some people think that animals are just like us, but with different bodies. Dr. de Waal, a scientist who studies animals, thinks that this is a good way to think. He says that animals are not just like us, but they are also very different.

'Robots are becoming more popular and will soon change many jobs. In the past, robots were only used in factories and car-making, but now they will be used in many other industries. Some people think that robots will take over most jobs that humans do, but others believe that humans will still have jobs. 

One company, Fastbrick Robotics, has created a robot that can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, which would take two human bricklayers a whole day to do. Another robot, Tally, helps stock supermarkets and makes sure everything is in order.

Some people think that robots will create new jobs for technicians and programmers, but others worry that robots will make it harder for humans to work together. A expert on robotics, Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, says that robots will change the way we work and that people will need to learn new skills to keep up.

In the next few years, robots will become even smarter and more efficient. Many companies will have a special person in charge of robots, and governments will make new laws about robots. However, some jobs may disappear and people will need to find new ones.

Dr. Zhang says that people should not rely on the government to protect their jobs, but should instead learn new skills to adapt to the changing job market. He also thinks that robots will change the way we live at home and that we will see new types of robots that can interact with us in new ways.

This change also brings challenges, such as making sure we are safe and private. It is important that we learn more about robots and prepare for the future job market. Many countries need more people with skills in science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) to stay competitive.'

Many people wonder why climbers want to climb mountains. One famous climber, George Mallory, said ""Because it's there."" This answer might inspire some people to try new things. Climbing can be a challenge and a way to have fun. 

Some people think climbing is just about adventure and excitement. Others believe it's about the feeling of freedom it gives them. But climbing can also be scary and restrictive. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not very liberating.

There are many different types of climbing, and each one has its own rules. Some climbers like to climb big mountains, while others prefer to climb smaller rocks. The way you climb depends on the type of climb you're doing.

Some people love climbing because it makes them feel free. Others enjoy the challenge of climbing and the sense of accomplishment when they reach the top. 

A US climber, Joe Fitschen, thinks we should ask ""Why do people climb?"" instead of ""Why climb?"" He believes that climbing is in our nature and that it's a way for us to test our limits.

Another idea is that climbing helps us develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for the environment. Climbing can also help us learn to appreciate the value of hard work and perseverance.

Some climbers believe that the most important thing is to be completely committed to your goal and to do it on your own, without help from others. This can make the achievement feel more special.

Finally, climbing can be a way to connect with nature and be present in the moment. It's a way to clear your mind and feel at peace. This is similar to the ideas of Zen philosophy, which teaches us how to be present and peaceful.

Overall, people climb for many different reasons. It's a way to challenge ourselves, have fun, and connect with nature.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at level A2:

My grandfather's garden was near a river. It was a nice place to visit. You could hear the sound of the water and birds singing in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this - a peaceful place to be alone. My grandfather's garden wasn't special, but it was nice. He didn't have a big greenhouse like some of his neighbors. They made their own greenhouses from old windows. My father was a quiet person. He liked to say funny things. He wasn't very ambitious, but he was good at fixing things around the house. My parents never moved house, but my mother liked to change the furniture. They got a piano once, but I didn't like it. I liked the two brass candlesticks, but they disappeared. My sister took piano lessons, but I never got to play. When I was older, I asked my mother why I couldn't play the piano. She said I wouldn't have practiced.

I loved playing by the river. I would go there with a fishing net and imagine I was in a different world. I would walk along the riverbank, looking for a good spot to take off my sandals and go into the water. I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it didn't seem likely. Then my father said there was a job opening for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I was surprised, but I was happy.

I changed some sentences to make them shorter and easier to understand, and removed some complex vocabulary and phrases. I also removed some details that were not essential to the main ideas of the text. The simplified text should be more accessible to a learner of English at level A2.<|eot_id|>"

Lawrence MacEwen lives on a small island called the Isle of Muck. I am visiting him. The wind is strong and it's hard to stand. His dog, Tie, is with us. MacEwen shows me around his island. He points to another island, Eigg, and says it gets a lot more rain than we do. We walk down the hill to move his sheep. MacEwen tells me about the island. It's a special place with geese that eat a lot of grass. The MacEwens have lived here for a long time.

We stop to move the sheep. Tie is not doing a good job. MacEwen is not happy. The island is a family business. Lawrence's wife, Jenny, helps him with the farm. Their son, Colin, takes care of the cottages, and their daughter, Mary, runs the hotel. Mary and her husband, Toby, love that their children can play outside and sail boats in the summer.

Life on the island is different. There is no electricity all the time. We have to wait for the lights to turn on. There is no mobile phone signal, so I don't have a phone. But I like it here. The island is special. One day, some musicians came to the island and played music. Everyone loved it. At night, Lawrence told me how he met his wife, Jenny. He met her on another island, Soay. Jenny didn't know much about farming, but she was good at typing.

I eat well on the island. The food is fresh and delicious. I go to the fisherman, Sandy, to get some fish for dinner. I take it back to Mary and we eat it together. The next day, I have to leave the island. The ferry might not come because of the strong wind. I would be stuck on the island for two more days, which would be nice.<|eot_id|>"

""The game design industry used to be hard to get into. Many people thought it was just a hobby for young people. But now, the industry is growing and needs more game designers. To get a job, you need to make games. You don't need a degree in computer science, but you need to be good at designing and making games.

It's not easy, though. You need to be very good at your job and work hard. You also need to have a good idea and be able to work with others. Some people think that making games is a way of life, not just a job.

There are different ways to get into the industry. You can take a postgraduate course in game design, which can help you learn more about the industry and get support. Many game designers start by working as programmers or artists and then move up to designing games.

It's also important to make connections and network with other people in the industry. This can help you get ahead and find new opportunities. The game industry is growing and there are many new possibilities and opportunities opening up.

In the past, people thought of games as just something for children, but now they are a big part of many people's lives. Games can be a fun way to learn and are becoming more popular all the time.""

I've always loved playing football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he never forced me to. I have a friend who used to play with us, but his dad was too pushy. He always said ""you can't do this"" and ""you can't do that."" My friend stopped playing because of this. I'm glad it didn't happen to me. When I score a goal from far away, people say it's just luck, but I've practiced a lot. You need to practice to be good at football. The best players in the world have practiced for a long time. When I teach kids, I want them to enjoy learning. I played many sports at school, like rounders and basketball. Football was my favorite. I want my son to have fun too. We're already reading books to him, even though he's too young to sit still. I hope he doesn't become too interested in football like me. When I started my professional football career, our manager helped us younger players move up to the first team. He didn't make a big deal about it, but we knew we had to work hard. We lost our first game, and a famous TV presenter said ""you can't win with kids."" This made us realize how much we had to work. We had some doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely on my friends and family. Having a lot of money can cause problems. Some people say I should help my parents more, but I've already helped them. My family is strong and independent, and they wouldn't want me to pay for everything. After I stop playing football, I want to take a year or two off and do things I haven't been able to do before. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing.<|eot_id|>"

We moved to Reef Point because of Sam Carter, my father's agent in Los Angeles. My father couldn't write his book while we lived in Los Angeles because he and the city didn't get along. Sam helped us find a cheap place to live. Reef Point is a small beach town that not many people visit. It's a bit far from the main resort, La Carmella, so only a few people come here. But during the hot summer, more people come to the beach. My father was working hard to finish his book and was in a bad mood. I would often go to the beach with my dog, Rusty. Rusty was a stray who decided to stay with us. My father wasn't happy about it, but Rusty became a part of our family.

Rusty loved the beach and would dig up things and bring them to me. Sometimes, he would find things that didn't belong to us, like a new shoe or a towel. I had to give those back to their owners. Rusty also liked to swim with me, but he couldn't swim as well as I could. One day, my father left to deliver his book to Los Angeles, and Rusty and I spent the day swimming and playing on the beach. We watched some surfers, and one girl caught my eye. She was very good at surfing and asked me to join them. I told her I didn't have a surfboard, and she said I could buy one.

Violet was standing in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She was waiting to board a ship called the Queen Caroline. Her friend Annie had told her to arrive late, but Violet got there early. Now she was getting impatient. An announcement came over the loudspeaker saying that there was a problem with the computer system. People in the line started to get upset. Some were frustrated and some were even angry. They had paid a lot of money for this trip and wanted it to go smoothly.

Violet was worried and looked for her phone in her bag. It was missing! This made her even more upset. She couldn't call the taxi company to see if she had left it in the taxi. She was starting to regret taking this trip.

A kind-looking couple behind her in the line offered to let her use their phone to call her son Harry. Violet asked them to call her neighbor Kristina to check if she had left her phone at home. If she didn't have her phone, she would be in trouble when she got to New York.

After a while, the lines started moving and Violet was able to board the ship. She went to the elevators and got to her room on the 12th floor. She was relieved to find that it had a balcony, which she had requested. She had been worried that it wouldn't be available.

Instead, he found 30,000 photos taken by a street photographer named Vivian Maier. Maloof has been studying Maier's life and work. He has many of her cameras, films, and photos in his home. He and his friend Anthony Rydzon are trying to learn more about Maier's life. They talked to people who knew her and looked at her old films and tapes.

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and grew up in France. She moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. She always carried a camera with her. Maier was a private person, but she loved taking pictures of people and things she saw on the street. She was very good at her job and didn't let anyone stop her from doing what she loved.

Maier's photos are very special because they are not just for show. They are art. She took pictures of women, children, old people, and poor people. Photography expert Larry Silverman thinks her pictures are very good and wonders if she was influenced by other photographers.

John Maloof is excited to share Maier's work with the world. He didn't know much about photography until he saw her pictures. Now, he takes pictures too and appreciates Maier's work even more. He wants to make sure people know about Vivian Maier and her amazing photographs.'

The story is very complicated because there are 20 main characters and a lot of things happen. Eleanor wanted to make each character important, so the book is very long - over 800 pages.

When I asked her about being successful at such a young age, she said it's nice because people in her country feel like they're all part of her success. She also said that some people don't understand what she's trying to do in the book. She wanted to write it in a special way, like a spiral, so that the story gets faster and faster as it goes.

I asked her if it matters if readers notice this special structure. She said she wanted to make a book that's fun to read, and if people want to find the special patterns, they can. Eleanor didn't plan the story beforehand. She just wrote and saw where it took her.

He loves how two pieces of wood can make a beautiful sound. Jonny started playing the guitar when he was 11. He wanted to learn the bass guitar too, so he studied how to make it. He and his brothers made things together, like model boats and planes. Jonny's dad taught him how to use tools like saws and chisels.

After school, Jonny went to university to study architecture. But he didn't finish the course. He realized that he liked making things more than designing buildings. He thought that making guitars was like sculpture, but instead of making art, he made things that people could use.

Jonny started making guitars for a living. At first, he didn't make much money. He had to clean windows part-time to make ends meet. But as he got better at making guitars, people started to notice and he could charge more. Now, Jonny makes about 10 guitars a year. He still has to work hard to make a living.

Jonny thinks it's easier for new guitar-makers today. People now know that UK-made guitars are good quality.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at the A2 level:

When we talk about English conversation, we usually start with the weather. This is because, as the famous writer Dr. Johnson said, ""When two English people meet, they first talk about the weather."" This is still true today. But many people try to explain why English people talk so much about the weather. They think that we are interested in the weather itself. But that's not true. We don't talk about the weather because we like the weather. We talk about it because it's a way to start a conversation and be friendly.

Some people think that the English weather is not very exciting. They say that we don't have big storms or extreme weather like other countries. But others think that the uncertainty of the weather is what makes it interesting. They say that we like to talk about the weather because it's a way to connect with others.

My research shows that people who talk about the weather are not really interested in the weather. They are using it as a way to be friendly and polite. We use fixed phrases like ""Nice day, isn't it?"" or ""It's cold today, isn't it?"" to start a conversation or fill a silence. This is like a secret code that helps us talk to each other.

We only talk about the weather in certain situations. We might use it as a greeting, to break the ice, or to fill a silence. So, even though it might seem like we talk about the weather all the time, we are actually using it as a way to be friendly and polite.

She couldn't find a book that would help her explain it, so she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started writing books for children in 2001. She was nervous, but excited to start this new job. She said that teaching is like acting, but writing is more relaxing.

Alice wants to write books that are fun and interesting for children. She thinks that many books for young people are either too sad or too imaginary. She wants to write books that are just right in the middle. She used to teach English and History together, and she loves seeing children become interested in a subject.

Alice started writing because she wanted to fill a gap in the market, but she also wanted to keep writing because she loves working with children. She was inspired to write her first book because she was going to have more free time when her sons grew up and left home.

Playing tennis on Centre Court at Wimbledon is a special experience. The grass is soft and quiet. You can hear the sound of your own shots echoing. The court is surrounded by a rich history and a big, old stadium. The players wear white clothes, and the crowd is respectful. This helps me focus on my game. 

When I play tennis, I try to forget everything else and just think about the match. The silence of the court helps me do that. But sometimes, when I hit a good shot, the crowd cheers and claps. I hear it, but it's far away. I'm so focused that I don't even think about all the people watching me on TV. 

I've always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My coach, my uncle Toni, told me it was the biggest tournament. When I was 14, I told my friends that I wanted to play there one day and win.

She has done voiceovers for many things, like TV shows and cartoons. She has to learn new voices quickly. For example, she had to learn how to say medical words correctly.

Shirley says that many actors think they can do funny voices, but it's not just about that. You have to bring the script to life and make the audience laugh. She has worked with many famous people, but they often don't get the parts because they're used to acting with their bodies.

Shirley started her career by taking a drama course. She did some singing for TV ads and then got a part in a cartoon. She realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be the right job for her.

Now, Shirley works on many projects, from educational videos to ads for vacuum cleaners. She has to sound excited about things she doesn't really care about, but she's good at it. She's learned to make her voice sound happy and cheerful. She says the key is to smile while you're talking.

Shirley has been in the business for a long time and has worked hard to get where she is. She recommends making a good showreel and practicing your voices.

Some people ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a dream job that many people have when they're young. But most people grow up and choose more practical careers. It seems silly to think that you can make a living by drawing simple doodles. However, some people do make a living as cartoonists. I did. I studied graphic design in college and then showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted my cartoons. I started selling them and was able to support myself.

You don't need a lot to become a cartoonist. You don't need a university degree, a lot of money, or even drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to make marks. But it's not easy. It's a tough job. You need to be very good at what you do and know how to make a living from it.

I've done different types of cartoons, like political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also written, drawn caricatures, and designed things. I take on any job I can get because it helps me learn and grow. It's also important to be smart, well-read, and curious about the world.

The business side of being a cartoonist is important. It's not easy to find a job as a cartoonist anymore. Most cartoonists have to sell their work themselves. You need to be good at selling and marketing your work. I've seen cartoonists with average drawing skills but excellent business skills do better than those who are very talented but not good at business.

Some cartoonists are worried about people stealing their ideas. But it's easy to protect your work by putting a 'c' with a circle around it and your name and date. And if someone does steal your work, it's not the end of the world. It can even be a lucky break!<|eot_id|>"

I didn't know why I wanted to get rid of it, but I did. I took it to the dump and was about to throw it away when a man stopped me. He asked if I was really going to throw it away. I said yes, but then felt sorry. He asked if he could have it, and I said okay. We parted ways. After that, I felt sad for a long time. Then, a few months ago, I got an email from a guitar dealer named Keith. He said he had my old guitar! It had been sold a few times since the man at the dump took it from me. Keith found my name on the back of the guitar and looked me up online. He contacted me through my work and offered to sell it back to me. I was very happy. I would have paid a lot for it, but he asked a fair price. I was surprised to remember that my dad used to put his name and address on everything I owned, even my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn classical guitar, but I didn't like it. I switched to electric guitar and played simple songs. Now, I've got my old guitar back and I'm going to start playing again.

Here is a rewritten version of the text, simplified for a learner of English at the A2 level:

There's been a lot of talk about sleep lately. When I wrote a book about people who have trouble sleeping, I felt like I was warning people about the dangers of not sleeping enough. Sleep is very important for our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important it is.

But what about dreams? People don't talk about dreams much. When we wake up early, we often cut off the last hour or two of sleep. This is when we have our most vivid and memorable dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time dreaming. In fact, we spend about six or seven years of our lives dreaming!

Researchers have studied dreams and found that they are important. They even found that people who have trouble sleeping have more dreams to make up for it. When we dream, our brains are working hard to make sense of things. Some people think that dreams help us be creative and think outside the box.

For example, actors, writers, and directors have a special relationship with their dreams. They use their dreams to come up with new ideas. But it's not just artists who need to think creatively. We all need to think creatively in our daily lives, whether it's at work or in our personal relationships.

Dreams can help us find new patterns and make new connections. They can even help us come up with new ideas. For example, when we wake up from a dream, we might have a sudden idea that we wouldn't have thought of otherwise.

I think that's why I write better when I wake up from a dream. Even a strange or disturbing dream can give me ideas and help me write more easily. We all need our brains to work well, and dreams are an important part of that.

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London and moved to a small town by the sea in England. When you visit her studio, you'll see many empty frames on the walls with photos of her two daughters. Susie is a very good artist who can copy famous paintings from a long time ago. She is very good at making copies of paintings by artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that people think they are the original paintings. She sells her copies to galleries and collectors, and they pay her a lot of money.

Susie is very good at her job, but she doesn't have any of her own paintings. She finishes each painting and then sells it. She is very busy and has many clients. Some people buy her copies to show in their homes, but others keep the original painting in a safe and show her copy instead. Susie is honest about what she does. She makes sure her copies look like the real thing, but she signs her name on the back of the canvas. She doesn't make fake paintings that people might think are real.

Susie used to work as an illustrator for a botanical garden, drawing plants. She learned to be very accurate and careful in her work. She is glad she found a job that pays her well and allows her to do what she loves. When young artists ask for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well and to be accurate. She also says that she has studied a lot to be able to make such good copies.

Susie likes to copy paintings by the French impressionists, like Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. She thinks people might think that modern art is easy, but it's actually very hard to copy the impressionists' style. She makes a good living from her work, but she doesn't make her own original paintings. She's happy with what she does and is good at it.<|eot_id|>"

Ellen MacArthur loves the sea. She used to be a sailor and wanted to be the fastest person on the water. She spent many days at sea, alone, and had to take care of everything herself. After one big trip, she realized that the world is like a small boat that we need to take care of. She started to think about how we can use things better and not waste them.

Ellen visited a place called South Georgia, where she saw old whaling stations that were abandoned. She thought about how we take things and then leave them behind. She started to think about how we can use things again and again, like carpets that can be used many times.

Ellen is now trying to help people understand the importance of taking care of the planet. She talks to big companies and governments about using renewable resources instead of non-renewable ones. She also started a charity to help young people think about how to make the world a better place.

Ellen misses the adventure of being at sea, but she thinks that her new mission is even more important. She wants to use her voice to make a difference and help the planet.

'Jordan Romero is 13 years old. He wants to climb Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. If he succeeds, he will be the youngest person to do so. Jordan wants to inspire other kids to go outside and be active. He is climbing Everest with his parents, Paul and Karen. They are a team called 'Team Romero'.

Jordan has already climbed five of the highest mountains on each continent. He wants to climb all seven. Climbing Everest is part of his goal. Some people think it's not a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the mountain. They think he might not be strong enough or experienced enough. But Jordan's parents are experienced climbers and think they can help him.

Jordan's father says, 'We know people might think this is a bad idea, but we're not listening. We're too busy preparing for the climb. We think about the risks, but we're confident that our experience will help us.'

Jordan's motivation is to achieve his goal. He doesn't care about being famous. His father says, 'This isn't about us trying to be famous because of Jordan's achievement. We just think he should do it now instead of later.'

Jordan likes the challenge of climbing mountains. He says, 'I just focus on achieving my goal.' But he also knows that he needs to do things to make his achievement famous, like writing a blog and giving interviews. His father says, 'If Jordan doesn't want to climb mountains anymore, we'll stop and do something else instead.'

""When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, you can be sure it's not classical music they're listening to. Most people know many pop group names, but ask friends if they know who Brahms was and they might not know. I'm studying music, but my friends and I don't know much about classical music. If you don't know who wrote the music, you won't buy their records. The statistics are not good for classical music lovers. Only 3% of concert tickets were sold for classical music last year. On average, classical music records sell only 300 copies. I think this is surprising. So, why don't teenagers like classical music? It's not because of TV and video games, as some people think. The truth is that classical music is not interesting to most people, especially teenagers. They like to listen to music fast and simple, not slow and complicated. Pop music is easy to listen to and has words, which classical music often doesn't. Classical music is powerful, but it's not about things that teenagers care about. The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families played music together at home, and it was important to be able to play an instrument. Now, we can find any music on the internet, and classical music is not popular. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? My teacher says that more people are going to classical concerts, but I think they're mostly older people. When I play classical music with my orchestra, I see mostly older people in the audience. I don't know why people like classical music more when they're older, but I know that if your parents like something, you might not like it. Some people think that schools are to blame for not teaching classical music well, but there are still kids who like playing classical music in school. They practice before and after school. Classical music is fun for them when they play it, but they don't listen to it otherwise. People often listen to pop music when they relax.""

Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother's car and looked at Almonside School. 'I'll show you I'm not happy to be here,' she said. Her mother was getting out of the car at the time, but Bonnie didn't care. Her mother knew how she felt.

Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside School was a strange place, with different buildings hidden among the trees on a hill. She saw signs that said 'Science block', 'gymnasium', and 'riding centre'. Bonnie saw the riding centre and got interested. 'Riding centre,' she said. 'That way,' said her mother.

Bonnie followed her mother to the headmaster's study. 'I wish you would walk beside me,' her mother said, but Bonnie didn't do that. Her mother talked to the headmaster, and Bonnie sat outside the door.

Bonnie got up and went to the riding centre. She saw a nice old building where the horses were kept and a big place for riding inside. She looked around, but there was no one there. She liked horses and was careful to respect them. The horses were well taken care of.

Bonnie walked along the stalls, looking at each horse and judging it. 'I know what they're doing here,' she said to a little pony. 'I think I've met you before,' she said to a brown horse with white. 'In my dreams, I rode you in a big competition...'

She saw his name: Maverick. She wanted to ride him. She found a saddle and bridle and put them on Maverick's back. She forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she sat on Maverick outside, she felt like a queen. She laughed, remembering her nickname at her old school.

'Maverick, you're the best horse I've ever ridden,' she said. 'I'm not joking, because I know about horses.' She rode Maverick around the paddock. It was fun, and she felt happy.

'I've met Cody Simpson before and I think he's very confident. He's only 15, but he has already released many popular songs. So, how did a laid-back surfer boy end up performing in front of thousands of fans? 'I started playing the guitar when I was six and writing songs when I was seven,' Cody says. 'But I loved swimming and surfing even more back then. I was busy with school and other things. I was 13 when I posted some videos online.' These videos were very popular. People wanted to see more of him, so he recorded more at home. The responses were amazing. Cody was a good swimmer and trained hard. But then record labels wanted him to sign a deal and move to the US. It was a difficult choice: stay in Australia or take a big risk. Cody decided to take the risk. 'It was hard for me, especially at such a young age, to choose what I wanted to do. Can you imagine being 12 or 13 and having to decide what you want to do for the rest of your life?' He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. 'It was a big surprise for most people. I'm a quiet person and I like to stay humble.' So Cody packed his bags and moved to the US with his family. He gave up one dream to try to make another one come true. His family is important to him and they support him. Of course, we all have doubts sometimes. 'Sometimes when I'm alone, I think about how my decision affected my little brother and sister. My little brother is eight and he's traveling the world, doing school on the road. I worry about the effect on him sometimes, but my family always reassures me that they're here to support me.' Success comes from being brave and taking chances. 'It all happened so fast and unexpectedly. Now, I'm visiting countries I never thought I'd visit and performing in front of hundreds of thousands of fans. It's like a dream come true, but I know it won't last forever.'

""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on something."" Jess looked at the painting. It was a picture of a river. The river was strange and beautiful. There were no animals, no birds, no people. Jess liked it. Mum said, ""It has a name.""

There was no boy in the picture. Mum said, ""Maybe Grandpa will add a boy later."" Jess knew what Grandpa would say if she asked him about the painting. He would say that the painting has its own meaning and we either understand it or we don't. Mum had asked him about the painting, but he said he didn't have time to explain it to everyone.

'The Borrowers' is a story about a family of tiny people who live in a house. They take things from the big people who live there to survive. I directed a TV version of the book. It was hard because people who love the book have strong ideas about how it should be made. I used the original drawings from the book to make sure it was right. The author wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the humans'. This made filming more complicated. The most important thing was to get the size right. The Borrowers are 10 times smaller than humans, so we had to be 10 times farther away when filming them. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from a low height. We never raised the cameras high except for some special shots. One big challenge was making the shadows look right when combining the tiny Borrowers with the big surroundings. We developed a special technique for this. After the series was shown, a famous director, George Lucas, called me to ask how I did it. We built a special set for the Borrowers' home under the floorboards. It was like a dream world. The actors had to carry big objects, like giant scissors, which made us all laugh. We also had a scene where the Borrowers go down a drain. The actors had to be swept down a tunnel with water hoses and said it was very scary. I wanted the costumes to be right, so I made them from heavy material. This made it hard for the actors to move. The costumes were so heavy that the leading actress couldn't even sit down during breaks. The weather was very hot during filming, and the actors didn't thank me for the heavy costumes. Most of the action happened away from the Borrowers' home, so we filmed them in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I drew pictures of each scene myself, which took a long time. In the end, the series was successful and people liked it.'<|eot_id|>"

The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in Bishop, a town surrounded by wilderness in the US. They like to launch balloons into the sky, about 35 km above the Earth's surface. They do this as a science project, but it's also an adventure. They want to see shooting stars, which are bright lights that appear when small rocks or pieces of metal enter the Earth's atmosphere.

The club prepares the balloons carefully. They put a special box with a camera, a tool to measure height, and a thermometer inside. They also attach GPS trackers to the box so they can find it later. The balloon gets bigger and bigger, like a small car, and then it rises into the sky.

The students chant ""Five, four, three, two, one"" and the balloon takes off. They follow it with flashlights, watching it disappear into the night. Some students stay to watch the shooting stars, lying on blankets on the mountain side. They gaze up at the incredibly clear sky, which is hard to believe is just a few hours from a big city like Los Angeles.

The balloon pops and the equipment falls back to Earth, helped by a parachute. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. It's not always easy to find, because there's not much inhabited land around Bishop. The students enjoy the challenge of finding the equipment, which is part of the adventure.

In this story, the club's leader says that the journey is important, because it helps them get to know the wilderness better. They've lost only two boxes in 53 launches. This time, it took them 11 hours to find the box, which was stuck in a canyon near a waterfall. They didn't see any shooting stars, but they had a great adventure and can talk about it with others.

Chloe remembers meeting a famous palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, for the first time. She was nervous, but he was kind and patient. This made her feel more comfortable.

I asked Chloe about how palaeontologists are portrayed in movies and TV shows.

She thinks it's important to teach young people about science and show them that it's interesting. She was involved in a TV documentary about dinosaurs, called Walking with Dinosaurs.

I've learned that there are two important things that make someone a great athlete: energy and being able to deal with disappointment. These qualities are more important than talent. The more dangerous the sport, the more important it is to have these qualities. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times, but he got up and kept trying until he was good at it.

For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a thin wire high above the ground between two big buildings. The wire was 66 meters above the ground, and there was no safety net. Helen had to hold onto a wire with her waist and use a long stick to help her balance. She took lessons from a professional high-wire walker to learn how to do it.

Helen said that the training was hard. She had to run up a big hill every morning, do exercises, and practice walking on the wire.

'Jeff Somers wanted to travel around the world. He had already written a book about his trip in a old car. Jeff liked motor sports and fixing cars. He rode an old bike to work and on holiday. After a trip to Amsterdam, he thought, ""I want to see the world on a bike."" Jeff didn't want a normal bike, so he built a special one called a penny farthing. He went to a museum to learn how to make it. Jeff tried to go on his trip in 2001 and 2003, but he got hurt and had to stop. Finally, in 2006, he went on his trip. He traveled to 23 countries on four continents. The best part was seeing Mount Everest in Tibet. People were amazed by his special bike. The worst part was when he got sick and had to drink dirty water. He was in a hostel for 10 days without medicine. But Jeff still loves his penny farthing and would go on another trip if he could.'

""Have you ever wondered what it's like to be a circus performer? Sophia Grayson teaches circus skills to young people at Circus Experience. She says her course is popular because it includes many different skills, like juggling, throwing and catching balls, and flying through the air on the trapeze. On the course, students learn new things each week and their parents come to watch them. Sophia says that to be a good circus performer, you need to keep practicing and trying new things. It's also important to be friends with other performers and to learn from them. Being fit is important too - circus performers need to train every day to stay strong. Sophia says that the best performers are those who want to do well and never stop improving. Some people think that being a circus performer is not safe or that you only work for a short time each year. But Sophia says that the real problem is thinking about the future - you can only perform on the road when you're young, and then you need to think about other options. The course also teaches students how to plan a business. Many students have started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences. Sophia warns that being a circus performer is not a job that makes a lot of money. It's a competitive job, but it's also a lot of fun!""

'Mariam Hobson is a singer who helps other singers by singing in the background. People often think that backing singers are not as good as the main singers. But that's not true. Backing singers have to be very good. Mariam loves her job because she never knows what she will be asked to sing. It could be a classical song, a pop song, or even a funny tune for a radio commercial. Sometimes producers ask her to sing in a strange way, like singing like a fish underwater! But Mariam just gets on with the job.

To be a good backing singer, you need to have good musical skills and be able to learn quickly. Sometimes, there is no written music to follow, so you have to remember everything. Mariam remembers her first time recording music for a movie. It was very complicated because there were eight of them singing different songs and an orchestra too. She was very nervous because if she made a mistake, they would have to record everything again. Recording sessions can take a long time.

One of Mariam's favourite jobs is helping songwriters. Some songwriters don't know which kind of music suits a female voice best. By listening to Mariam sing their song, they can learn how to make it better.'

When she was a teenager, her brother Jamie got a special bike and started racing. Vicky thought it looked fun and decided to try it too. She loved it and started racing every day.

After joining the club, Ana sang with 50 other students at a concert. Her brother asked her to write a song for his band, and she wrote her first song, Falling Stars. She liked writing it so much that she took a songwriting course. Ana was the youngest student, but she knew a lot about music. She wrote a song called Something to Say about how she felt when the teacher didn't listen to her. She put the song online and it became very popular. People loved it and found new meanings in the words each time they listened. A music company owner, Joss Alton, came to ask Ana to join his company. At first, Ana was unsure, but Joss promised she would be free to write her own songs. Ana liked this idea and performed at a concert in Dublin. The concert was a big success.

He loves boats, but I don't. I had always wanted to visit this place because my great-grandparents used to live there. I asked Harry if I could come, and he finally said yes! A few days before we left, there were big storms in the area. But the weather forecast said it would be calm when we were there. Harry took care of everything, so I didn't have to worry. When we got to Canada, we joined a group and took small boats. The guide said there weren't many people living in this area, and we only saw dolphins and birds on our first morning. We could see some islands in the distance, but the fog was too thick, so we just enjoyed the boat's pattern in the water. We stopped for hours to look at the rock pools on the beach. They were full of colorful fish I had never seen before. It was great to not worry about time. We always had lunch and dinner together, making food over campfires. When we went to sleep on the boats, it felt like a stress-free life! When it was time to leave, I was sad. But I knew I would miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also excited to tell everyone about our adventures when I got back home!'

We're happy to make a little money, but we're not trying to make a profit. It's easier now that we have our own equipment. We also know how many people are coming because everything is online. When people come to talk about the film after it's finished, it's great. We're in touch with other film clubs from all over the country. We've visited them and learned how they do things.

In an interview, she said, 'Because my family moved a lot when I was young, I learned to make new friends easily. This helped me write about the main character, Amelia, who starts at a new school. The funny parts of the book are about Amelia's family and her older brother. Since I don't have a brother, I had to use my imagination to write about it.'

Janine started writing the book during the summer when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother always wanted to write a book, and her teachers encouraged Janine to write too. So, she decided to write a story. The year before, she won a short story competition, and that gave her confidence to send her book to a publishing company. They liked it, and a year later, the book was in bookshops.

One reviewer said that the book is not just about happy teenagers, but also about the challenges they face. The reviewer thinks that Janine is a good writer, even though she is still young. Janine is getting used to being a famous writer, but she says that every writer is different, and she just likes to hang out with her friends to get ideas for her writing.

'My name is Tom. I'm 15 years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad got a job as the castle's manager. He works for a company that takes care of old buildings and lets people visit them. We were worried about moving to the island because we didn't know what it would be like. We didn't have a school there and our new home wasn't as comfortable as our old one. But we got used to it quickly. The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment is nice. In the summer, the island is very lively and there are parties on the beach. In the winter, we only see our neighbors and don't have many friends our age. The adults on the island help each other and work together to fix things. The biggest change for me was traveling to school every day by boat. I like going on the boat, especially on stormy days, but the ferry doesn't run then. I have to be careful not to miss the bus or the last ferry home. When my friends come to visit, I tell them to hurry up! We see beautiful views, like the sunset over the sea. Sometimes it's foggy, but then the sun comes out again. We have big storms sometimes, and I worry about the castle. But it's been here for a long time and it's still standing.'

'I live in a house in the countryside in Scotland. I love nature and animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby - birdwatching! I went to the mountains in Scotland with my family. We saw many birds in their natural habitat. My parents showed me how to tell the difference between the species and where to find them. It was amazing! After that, I joined a local birdwatching club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species. I've almost reached my goal because I've seen birds from other countries on family holidays. We look for places where we can join birdwatching groups to see new birds. I went to Egypt and last summer we went to South America. I was excited to see my 200th species, but it didn't happen. That's okay, because I've learned that you have to be patient with this hobby. I posted a video about my challenge online and many people enjoyed it. My teachers asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I felt a bit nervous, but it went well. I might do another presentation next year! I'm lucky to live in the countryside. I think it's a good idea for birdwatching clubs to try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter how old they are, and it doesn't have to cost a lot of money.'

'In recent years, there has been a change in how students learn in universities and colleges. Now, students are encouraged to start doing research early on in their studies. This is because research is not just for famous experts or scientists who are discovering new things. Research is a way to learn and improve our understanding of the world. It's a way to think critically and solve problems.

As a student, you will be doing research as part of your studies. You will be asking questions, finding answers, and making new discoveries. You will be learning how to think critically and solve problems. These skills will be useful not just in your studies, but also in your future job.

Research is not just about finding answers. It's about asking questions like ""Why?"", ""How?"", and ""What if?"". It's about looking at things in a different way and finding new solutions.

Many students have already been doing research without even realizing it. For example, when you did a project at school or asked questions about something that interested you, you were doing research. When you decide what to do on holiday or how to fix something, you are also doing research.

In college and university, you will be expected to think critically and ask questions. You will be expected to evaluate information and make your own decisions. This might seem difficult at first, but it's an important part of learning.

It's important to be careful when reading information and listening to others. You should not just accept what you are told without thinking about it. You should question what you read and hear, and make sure it makes sense.'

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for A2 level learners:

Cities have always been important for learning and creativity. Think of the coffee shops in 18th-century London, where people gathered to discuss science and politics. Or the cafes in modern Paris, where famous artist Pablo Picasso talked about modern art. But city life can be difficult. The same coffee shops that encouraged discussion also helped spread diseases. Picasso eventually left the city and moved to the countryside.

Modern cities are both exciting and overwhelming. Scientists are now studying how cities affect our brains. They have found that cities can make us less clever and even affect our memory. One reason is that cities often lack nature. Studies have shown that patients in hospitals recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small glimpses of nature can help our brains work better.

This research is important because most people now live in cities. We used to live in the countryside, but now we are crowded into cities with millions of strangers. This can affect our mental and physical health. Cities are full of distractions, like people walking quickly, cars, and confusing streets. Our brains have to work hard to process all this information.

The brain is like a powerful computer, but it takes a lot of energy to focus on all the things around us. Natural places, like parks, don't require as much effort. This is called attention restoration theory. It means that being in nature can help our brains rest and recover.

Before scientists studied this, philosophers and architects were warning about the problems of city life and trying to find ways to include nature in cities. They designed parks like Central Park in New York, where people can escape the city. Spending time in a park can even improve our brain function.

So, why do cities continue to grow, even though they can be difficult? Research shows that the same things that make cities overwhelming can also make them creative. The concentration of people and interactions in cities leads to innovation. Just like the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to new ideas, the crowded streets of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, contribute to its success as a center of technology.

The key is to find a balance between the benefits and challenges of city life.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for a learner of English at level A2 (CEFR):

""Do our thoughts happen only in our heads? It seems like a strange question. We can use special machines to look inside our brains and see what's going on. But I think we should think about what's outside our heads too. There is a lot of evidence that shows that things around us can help us think and learn. For example, archaeologists have found that ancient people used stones, shells, and other objects to help them remember and understand the world.

Most of what we know about our brains comes from studying people who are isolated from their surroundings. This makes sense for scientists, but it means we often forget that our thoughts are connected to the things around us. I'm not saying that our brains aren't important, but I think our minds are more than just our brains. Instead, I think our intelligence comes from our brains and the things we use to think and learn.

I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). It says that things we use, like sticks, stones, and tools, are connected to our brains and help us think. This idea helps us understand how our minds have changed over time and how we use things to think and learn. For example, a blind person with a stick is a good example of how our minds can change and adapt to new things. The stick becomes a part of the person's body, and the person uses it to feel and understand the world.

I think our minds are always changing and growing, and that's because we use things to help us think and learn. This is a special ability that humans have, and it's what makes us different from other animals. I want to show that our minds are connected to the things around us, and that's what makes us who we are.""

""Photography has changed the way we see the world. It has had a big impact on American culture and society. People in the United States were very excited about photography from the very beginning. This was because it was a new technology that could capture images quickly and easily. Photography also allowed people to share their experiences and memories with others.

Photography was important because it helped people to show who they were and what they looked like. It was also a way to capture special moments and events. Many people used photography to take pictures of their families and homes.

Photography is a unique way to capture the world. It is a record of what was in front of the camera. But it is also a reflection of the person who took the picture. This means that the same picture can have different meanings depending on who is looking at it and why.

Photography has become an important part of art. Many artists use photography in their work. This is because photography can be used to create new and interesting images. It is now common for artists to use photography in their paintings, sculptures, and other forms of art.

Overall, photography has changed the way we see and understand the world. It has given us a new way to capture and share our experiences and memories.""

Here is the simplified text for A2 level learners:

'William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the'science of mental life'. This idea is still important today. We all have thoughts and feelings, and we know what this means. But psychology is hard to understand because it's not just about humans. Animals like rats and monkeys also have thoughts and feelings. 

Psychologists are interested in human psychology, which includes our thoughts, feelings, and how we understand the world. Each person has their own thoughts and feelings, and they come from our own experiences. We can use our own experiences to make judgments about psychology, but this can be tricky. 

Sometimes, two people can understand things differently. That's why psychologists try to find ways to decide what is true and what is not. They study how people behave and try to understand what is going on in their minds. 

Psychology is about the mind or brain, but we don't fully understand how the brain works. Psychologists study people's behavior to learn more about what's going on in their minds. 

Studying psychology is like solving a puzzle. You have to look at clues and figure out what they mean. The clues come from careful observations and measurements. 

Psychology has the same goals as other sciences: to understand, predict, and control the things it studies. It can help us understand ourselves and make our lives better. 

Psychologists have used their findings to help us in many ways, such as teaching children to read, designing safer machines, and helping people who are upset. 

People have been thinking about psychological questions for a long time, but scientists have only been studying them for about 150 years. Early psychologists tried to understand the mind by thinking about their own thoughts and feelings. But this method has limitations. Today, psychologists prefer to study the behavior of others to understand the mind.'

In a special storehouse in Michigan, USA, there is a collection of products that didn't sell well. It's called the Museum of Failed Products. The owner, Carol Sherry, sees each product as a story of failure for the people who designed, marketed, and sold it. The museum is surprising because it's a profitable business. Many companies don't keep samples of their failed products.

The museum was started by Robert McMath, a former marketing expert. He wanted to collect a reference library of consumer products, not just failed ones. But over time, his collection became mostly unsuccessful products because most products fail. This might be because companies are too optimistic and don't want to talk about their failures.

In today's culture, people are often encouraged to be positive and focus on the good things. This can be helpful, but it can also make people avoid talking about their failures. A psychologist named Tali Sharot found that people often think they have more control over their lives than they really do. This can lead to unrealistic expectations.

A psychologist named Gabriele Oettingen studied how thinking positively about the future affects our motivation. She found that it can actually make people less motivated to achieve their goals. People who think about how well things could go often end up doing worse than those who don't.

A psychologist named Carol Dweck believes that our experiences of failure depend on our beliefs about ability. Some people think that ability is fixed and can't be changed, while others believe it can be developed through hard work and practice. Dweck thinks that believing ability can be developed is a happier and more effective way to approach challenges.

Sports teams often do better when they play at home. But why is this? Some people think it's obvious, but experts are now questioning this idea. Two main factors have changed the way we think about home advantage: science and money. Scientists want to know what makes players perform well, and they have come up with many theories about home advantage. Meanwhile, people who make money from sports want to know why home advantage matters at all. If players are paid well, shouldn't they feel comfortable anywhere?

Fans also have an important role to play. They can make a lot of noise and cheer on their team. But sometimes, fans think that the noise they make helps the team win, when in fact it might not. In fact, most of the time, the noise doesn't make a difference.

One interesting study found that referees make different decisions when they hear a lot of noise. They are less likely to make decisions against the home team. This is because referees don't want to make the home crowd angry.

Studies have also looked at how home advantage has changed over time. In the past, home teams used to win a lot more often. But now, the difference between home and away wins is smaller. This might be because players are now treated better on the road, with comfortable travel and good hotels.

Despite all these changes, one thing remains a mystery: why does home advantage vary from sport to sport? For example, basketball is a sport where playing at home is very advantageous, while baseball is a sport where home advantage is much smaller. One possible reason is that team spirit is more important in team sports like basketball, while individual skills are more important in sports like baseball.

Another possible reason is that playing at home gives players a sense of territoriality, or a desire to defend their own turf. This might be connected to a primitive urge to protect what's ours.

Overall, home advantage is a complex issue that is still not fully understood.<|eot_id|>"

‘The more I practice, the better I get,’ said golfer Gary Player a long time ago. This saying is popular among athletes and coaches. But what does it really mean? Some people think it means that practice makes you lucky, but Player meant the opposite - that practice makes you better. This idea is important in sports, because it talks about whether natural talent or practice is more important.

Some people think that practice is more important. A psychologist named Anders Ericsson said that with 10,000 hours of practice, you can become an expert in anything. Many books have been written about this idea. But another expert, Epstein, disagrees. He thinks that it's not that simple. He says that we need to look at why some people are good at something and others are not. He traveled around the world to learn more about this.

Epstein talked to people in different places, like Kenya and Sweden, and even studied sled dogs in Alaska. He found that some dogs are naturally good at racing because of their genes. This made him think that maybe some people are naturally good at things too. He also looked at why some people are better at certain sports than others. For example, he asked why men and women are separated in athletic competitions.

Many children in rich countries are unhappy and feel lonely. A writer named Jay Griffiths thinks she knows why. She says that children are not spending enough time outside and playing in nature. They are too busy playing with screens like TVs and computers. This is making them unhappy.

A recent study found that many children would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Some people who are now over 40 remember their own childhoods as happy times when they spent hours playing outside. They would climb trees, play in streams, and make dens in old sheds.

Griffiths argues that parents are too worried about their children's safety and are keeping them indoors. This is helping the toy and gadget industry, which makes money from keeping children entertained indoors. She also thinks that some rules and regulations are too strict and are making childhood less fun.

Griffiths' book is interesting and has some good points, but some people disagree with her. She is a romantic who thinks children are naturally good and kind, but this is not always true. She also thinks that children need to take risks and have accidents to learn how to be safe. However, she does not explain how to make sure these accidents are not too big or too dangerous.

'I'm a psychologist who studied a lot. I'm good at solving problems, but not because of what I learned in school. Most problems can't be solved with formulas or answers from books. They need creativity and wisdom, which come from life experiences. Children learn these skills through play. I study how play helps children grow and develop. All mammals, including humans, play when they're young. Children play more than any other young animals because they have a lot to learn. Play is how we learn and grow. The most important skills children need to learn are not taught in school. These skills, like being creative, getting along with others, and controlling their emotions, are learned through play. We need people who can think creatively and solve new problems. If we want a successful workforce, we need to teach children to think creatively. Creative people are playful people. Even famous scientists like Albert Einstein learned through play. We can't teach creativity, but we can stop it from growing by focusing too much on what we want children to learn, rather than what they want to learn. Children are born with a desire to play with others and this is how they learn social skills and be good friends. Play is voluntary, so children can choose to stop if they want to. This is what makes play fair and democratic. Unfortunately, school has become too strict, with less time for breaks and more homework. Adults are now always watching and telling children what to do. This is not good for children. They need more freedom to play and explore. We should give children back their childhood and let them play and learn in their own way.'

'Many young people in their twenties are using social media to find a job. Sites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them connect with potential employers. But with more opportunities comes more chance to make mistakes. A young jobseeker in the US contacted a successful marketing executive on LinkedIn. The executive had many important contacts, and the young person thought they could help him find a job. But the executive was not impressed. She rejected his request and sent a mean message that became famous online. Many people were shocked, and the executive probably regrets her harsh words.

The incident shows that using social media for job hunting can be tricky. Many young people don't know how to use it correctly. Social media is a tool that can help you find a job, but you need to use it wisely.

When we were teenagers, social media was just for fun. We used it to escape from our parents and teachers, and to be someone we're not. But when it comes to finding a job, social media is different. You need to be professional and respectful.

Some young people think that because many people like their posts on Facebook, they will be popular on LinkedIn too. But this is not true. You need to be careful and respectful when using social media for job hunting.

Employers often complain that young job seekers are too familiar and come across as arrogant. This makes them think that we're an ""entitled generation"". But this is not true. Many young people are desperate to find a job and are using social media to help.

So, how can you use social media correctly? First, introduce yourself and explain what you can do for the person you're contacting. Don't send generic emails, and be humble. Remember, social media can be a great tool, but you need to use it wisely.'

Some people think that newspapers will soon disappear. But, surprisingly, old media have a way of surviving. Theatre, radio, and even vinyl records have all had a comeback.

Newspapers were once new and exciting, but it took a long time for them to become popular. This was because it was hard to print and distribute newspapers until the 19th century. People used to think that the world was unchanging and only needed news occasionally. But now we expect things to change and we need to stay updated.

Journalism as a job is not very old. Before the 19th century, news was shared in the marketplace or tavern, where rumors and misunderstandings spread easily. Today, with the internet, we can get news quickly and easily. But instead of using this to help us understand the world, newspapers are trying to be the first to break the news and get a lot of comments.

""If we were meant to live in the dark, we would be happy in the night. But we are not. Our bodies are used to living in the light of the sun. This is because most of us don't think about being daytime creatures, just like we don't think about being primates or mammals. But it's true. We've made the night brighter by putting lights everywhere. This is like building a dam to control a river. It has good and bad effects. The bad effect is called light pollution. It's because we don't use our lights correctly. We shine them upwards and outwards, not downwards where they're needed. This makes the night darker and changes the way many living things, including us, behave.

In the past, people didn't use so many lights, so the night was darker. Imagine walking in London at night in 1800. There were only a few lights. The city was not very bright. Now, we've made the night bright like a city. But this is not good for many living things. Some animals are attracted to light and get lost or hurt. Birds can even crash into buildings at night.

We think that light pollution only affects astronomers, but it's not just about them. We all need darkness to be healthy. Darkness helps our bodies work properly. If we don't have darkness, we can get sick. We need darkness to feel tired and sleep at night. It's like our bodies have a natural clock that needs to be set. If we mess with this clock, it can cause problems.

We are like frogs near a bright highway. We are trapped in our own light. We've forgotten our place in the universe and how we fit into the world. We need to remember the stars and the rhythm of day and night.""

'A big company has decided not to keep track of its employees' holidays. The idea came from a smaller internet company that already does this. The big company's boss says that employees can take as much holiday as they want, as long as they are sure it won't affect their work. But is this a good idea? The smaller internet company has only 2,000 employees and provides only one service. The big company has 50,000 employees and many different services. It's hard for employees to know what their colleagues are doing and whether their absence would harm the business.

Even if employees try to plan ahead, there is always more work to do when they come back. This can make them feel guilty and stressed. They might not take holidays at all or feel too guilty to take them. This could lead to a decrease in productivity. The company might also become a place where people work too much and don't take breaks. This could make people feel like they need to work all the time to get ahead.

Technology has made it easy to work from anywhere, so people can never really be sure when they are working or not. This can make people feel like they are being watched all the time, which can be bad for their mental health.

Workers need a break from work to rest and relax. This is important for their health. The company's policy might not be good for their well-being. I'm not sure if this policy will really work or if it's a good idea.'

Some people think it's very important, but it can also be slow. Some scientists are now using a new way called preprints. A preprint is a draft of a paper that is shared online before it's officially published. This way, other scientists can read and comment on it quickly. This helps to share new results fast and get feedback from others.

Some people think that publishing in good journals is important for their careers, so they might not share their work until it's perfect. This can lead to problems, like hiding important information or making mistakes. Preprints can help solve this problem because they are open to everyone and anyone can comment. This way, scientists can focus on the work itself, not where it's published.

In the past, scientists used to discuss their work with each other, but now they can share it with the whole world through preprints. This can help to share important results that might not be published in journals. It also means that more people can read and use the work, which is good for science.'

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level A2 on the CEFR:

What is a poem? I ask my students, and they often say it's like a painting with words. But I'm not satisfied with this answer. One day, I asked my students to choose an object and write two paragraphs about it. The first paragraph should be like a scientist's description, and the second paragraph should be from the point of view of the object itself. One student chose an oxygen mask. This was an interesting choice because it helped us understand how poetry is special.

I didn't like poetry when I was in school. I thought it was confusing and didn't make sense. But now I think poetry is special. It's not like other writing because it can be short and still have a big impact. Sometimes we read a poem and it doesn't make sense at first, but then we understand it and it's powerful. We often look for poems to be deep and emotional, but we can also find them in everyday life. A poem can be like a puzzle that makes us think.

What do we want from a poem? We want it to be beautiful, moving, and thought-provoking. But we can find these things in other art forms too. A poem is special because it can be ambiguous, which means it can have many meanings. This is like everyday life, where things are not always clear-cut. Some people think a poem is like a machine, while others think it's like a wild animal. Both views are interesting, and thinking about them can change our understanding of the world.

A poem is a creation, like a thing made. It's not like other writing because it's not made to sell or to inform. It's made for its own sake. This is why it can be surprising and special.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at level A2:

I bought a metal detector after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money then. My wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip out. I've been detecting for many years and have found many interesting things. But it wasn't until 40 years later that I found something that impressed Marion as much as the gold ring. It was a rainy day and I had some free time. I decided to search a spot near my house that had old farming equipment. The detector beeped twice, and I dug down to see what it was. The first time it beeped, I found a piece of an old wheel. The second time, I found something round and golden. I was excited and kept digging until I saw a beautiful, intricate pattern. It was like nothing I had ever seen before. I took it to the car and couldn't stop staring at it. When I got home, I showed it to Marion and told her it was a very old and rare piece of jewelry. We didn't try it on because it was too valuable. We kept it in our house for a few days, but then I hid it in a safe place because I was worried it might get lost or stolen. Eventually, I took it to the authorities and they said it was very important and valuable. They sold it to the British Museum in London. We got £350,000 for it, which we split with the owner of the field. But the most important thing is that I got to keep the memory of finding it and being a part of history.

'Sleeping is one of my favourite things to do when I travel. But I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends tell me about their trips, they always have a plan for every minute. They visit museums and go on hikes. But my trips are different. I like to have some free time to take a nap in the afternoon or sleep in late in the morning. I think this is one of the best things about travel. When I was in Mexico, I slept a lot. It was nice to sleep in a new place, away from my own bed. I felt relaxed and had good dreams.

I think sleep is connected to travel. When we travel, we see and experience new things. We hear new sounds and smells. This is what makes our sleep different when we're on the road. It's not just about resting, it's about processing all the new things we've seen and experienced.

Sleep is also different in different places. For example, in Trinidad, people wake up early and sleep a lot in the middle of the day. It takes me a few days to get used to this. But when I do, I feel like I'm really part of the place. I remember one time in Santo Domingo, I had a big lunch with some friends. We were all tired, so we went to sleep. It was nice to relax and feel like a local.

I like that I remember my sleep when I travel. I think about the smells and sounds of my new place. If you want to travel slowly and enjoy everything, then sleeping is a big part of that. Maybe I should tell my friends about this. They might understand that sleeping is an important part of traveling too.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Reduced vocabulary: I replaced some complex vocabulary with simpler alternatives, such as ""favourite"" instead of ""deepest pleasure"", ""nice"" instead of ""profound"", and ""relaxed"" instead of ""liberated"".
* Simplified sentence structure: I broke up long sentences into shorter ones and used simpler sentence structures to make the text easier to follow.

I told him I was going to Magadan, a city in eastern Siberia, but I didn't have a return ticket. I wanted to ride my bicycle back to England. Sergei was surprised and said there was no road from Magadan. I told him I thought there was a road, even if not many people used it. He asked if I was going alone. I said yes, with a friend named Al. Sergei looked doubtful and said ""Holodna"" (cold). I showed him my warm clothes and explained that I had bought them cheaply. I didn't tell him that I was on a tight budget. I had started planning this trip six years ago in a lecture hall in Scotland. I had written a note to my friend Al, asking if he wanted to cycle across a highway in Pakistan and China. He said yes, and now we were going to meet in Siberia.

Before I flew, I had to sign some papers. One was to say I was healthy, and the other was to empty my pockets because small things can be dangerous during the flight. I also had to promise to stay calm and look at the horizon to know which way to go. Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety talk. I was told not to touch anything. When we started moving down the runway, I felt a bit nervous. My legs were shaking and I didn't want to touch the important parts of the plane. The pilot, Dario, told me to relax and enjoy the view when we were upside down. But I was too scared to relax. It's hard to explain, but you have to be calm and focused to fly a plane like this. If you get scared, you might pass out. We took off and started flying. It was very fast and we did some sharp turns. I felt my heart racing and my stomach was in my throat. We flew low over the ground and then did a big loop. I was upside down and saw fields below. The flight was over after 10 minutes. It was exciting, but I was glad it was over.

Doug used to be a marine biologist and commercial diver. He learned about surviving in cold places while diving. One day, a TV crew came to Antarctica where he was working. They asked him to show them around. After 48 hours, he realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for him. He loves traveling, adventure, and underwater filming.

Doug has worked on many big TV shows. He was one of the first people to film in Antarctica. He says it was exciting to explore new places and capture amazing moments on camera. When he started, cameras and technology were not as good as they are now. He had to remember everything and think carefully about what shots he needed. Now, with digital technology, he can take many photos and watch them right away.

Doug has a lot of experience filming in cold places. He knows how to stay warm and healthy. He's been to the Arctic and seen polar bears in their natural habitat. He's had some exciting moments, like when he filmed a mother bear and her cub. He also had some failures, like when he couldn't identify some birds.

He had to swim in cold water, fight against frostbite and polar bears. Just eight months later, he went to the South Pole. Now, he is going back to the North Pole again.

This time, Pen will walk with two friends for three months. They will measure the thickness and density of the ice. Nobody has done this before. The results will be very important for scientists. They will learn more about global warming and how it affects the ice.

Pen was trained to be strong and brave. When he was a child, his father's old nanny took care of him. She sent him outside in the cold weather with few clothes on. His father loved adventure, and Pen grew up to be very strong. He is married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too. She helps him with his work and is worried about him when he is away.

Pen has two children. He is going to be away from them for a long time, so he won't have much contact with them. He is also worried about being 47 years old and not feeling prepared for the trip. He is going to be with two other people, Ann and Martin, and they will have a team to help them.

I took a break from being a professional athlete. I wanted to do different things like write, work on TV, and talk to businesses and schools. But I missed the feeling of competing. So, I started doing marathons and triathlons. Then, my friend Ben Fogle asked me to row across the Atlantic Ocean with him. I liked rowing and wanted to do it again. Ben and I talked about the costs - the boat and equipment would cost £70,000. We needed to work hard to make it happen. I also thought about the money I would lose by not working. As a retired athlete, I make money by speaking at conferences. But I wouldn't be able to do that if I was away for the race. Rowing across the Atlantic would be a new challenge and a way to earn money. We learned a lot while preparing for the race. One of the most important things I learned was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My training for the Olympics was hard, but it was straightforward. I was worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. But as we prepared, my concerns went away. The Atlantic Rowing Race is not just about rowing. It's about being strong mentally. Ben had done some tough things, like running a long distance and spending time on a deserted island. But he couldn't row very well. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by how little I knew about his experiences. I should have been more patient with him, but I knew he needed to improve a lot. I should have realized that when I agreed to race with him.

When I first made my cooking show, ""In Search of Perfection"", I wasn't sure how people would like it. There was a lot of talk about a food revolution in Britain, and I thought our show would be different because it would show how to cook with history, memories, and science. I was a bit worried, but I didn't need to be. The show was a success, and it led to other projects, including a book about my restaurant.

In each project, I like to go on a journey, whether it's into the past, into someone's mind, or into cooking techniques. I wrote several books, each one for a TV show of the same name. In these books, I travel to different places and meet interesting people who make special foods. In my latest book, ""In Search of Total Perfection"", I travel all around the world to meet people who make amazing foods. They spend many years trying to make their foods perfect.

Perfection is a personal thing. Even choosing which dishes to include in the book was hard because people have different opinions. Some people might say, ""Where's steak and kidney pie?"" But I worked with my team to choose dishes that everyone would like.

I didn't want to claim that my recipes are the only perfect way to make a dish. Instead, I used my cooking skills and scientific knowledge to understand what makes each dish special. I talked to food makers and chefs to learn more. The book title ""Total Perfection"" is a bit misleading, because perfection is not always easy to achieve. The dictionary says that perfection is when something is perfect, but it also says that it's about trying and improving until you get it right.

I loved making this book because I got to try new foods, meet new people, and explore different places. I even got to make ice cream from fresh milk and try to make a perfect Neapolitan-style pizza!<|eot_id|>"

Psychologist Keith Davidson says that social media can help you find your identity and discover what you like. It's also a good way to practice social skills in a comfortable way.

Professor Andrew Phillips thinks that social media is good for quiet people who have special interests. You can connect with others who like the same things.

Pauline White, an expert on digital education, says that teenagers are using social media to create their own content, like videos and blogs. This is a great way to develop skills and be creative.

Charlotte likes to read fantasy books. She likes books that explore deep thoughts and feelings. She was worried that she couldn't write a good book like those. But she likes a book called How Not to Write a Novel. It says that if readers can guess what will happen, the story is not exciting.

Charlotte's parents are journalists. Her father knows someone in the publishing business, which helped get her book noticed. Charlotte is grateful for her good luck. She knows that getting someone to read your first book is hard, but after that, it's up to you to be a good writer.

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a learner of English at level A2 (CEFR):

""We went to a ski resort in the US to learn freestyle skiing. Our instructor, Gareth, told us that speed is important, but we should be careful. One of my friends, David, tried to ski-jump first. He went too fast and fell. Gareth reminded us that speed can be unpredictable.

I wasn't very good at freestyle skiing. I had never tried it before. I liked skiing, but only doing simple turns. I thought freestyle skiing looked fun, but I was afraid to try it. I didn't want to look silly in front of the other skiers.

At the ski resort, we practiced on trampolines and small ski jumps. We had to learn to control our movements in the air. Gareth helped us with exercises to improve our balance and coordination. I was not very good at first, but I kept trying.

We went back to the mountain to try again. It took me a few tries to land properly. When I finally did, I felt proud. But then I lost my skis! They slid down the mountain without me.

I learned that freestyle skiing takes practice and patience. It's not just about going fast, but also about controlling your movements. I'll keep practicing and try to get better.""<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a learner of English at level A2:

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty and your nails are digging into the harness. You stop suddenly and then go slowly up. Then you drop down quickly and your stomach is in the air. You feel scared and your senses are mixed up. But you chose to go on the ride, just like millions of other people every year. What's strange is that amusement parks are very popular, even though they're very scary. Behind the scenes, there are many people who work hard to make the rides. They are engineers, designers, and marketing experts. 

Rollercoaster designers are not just people who make the ride go up and down. They have to make sure the ride is safe and exciting. They also have to make it new and interesting so that people want to go on it again. Some people might think that rollercoasters are getting more and more extreme, but most of the techniques used today were invented a long time ago. 

I talked to three experts about rollercoasters. They said that the key to making a good ride is to make sure it's exciting but also safe. They also said that they have to be careful not to make the ride too scary or too boring. They want people to feel like they're having an adventure. To do this, they have to test the ride many times before it opens to the public. 

Some people might think that rollercoasters will change with new technology, like virtual reality. But one of the experts said that the physical experience of the ride will always be the most important part. People will always want to feel the thrill of the ride, even if it's just for a few seconds.

* Shortened sentences and paragraphs

Here is the simplified text for a learner of English at level A2:

Miranda Ellington is a 25-year-old choreographer. She creates dance performances for many theaters and dance companies. She also still dances sometimes. I'm curious why she does both. 

She says being a dancer again reminds her of when she was a student and had to follow choreographers' orders. As a choreographer, she likes teaching young dancers. They are open to new ideas and willing to try new things. They are eager to succeed, but they don't know their strengths and weaknesses yet. This makes it easier to work with them.

When Miranda creates a new dance, she focuses on the steps and the music. She tries to make the best dance possible, even if she doesn't like the music. Sometimes, dancers don't like the music, but she has to find a solution. She doesn't have the option to change the music.

Miranda doesn't like working for one company all the time. She likes to work with different people and adapt to their styles. This way, she doesn't get stuck in a routine.

We talked about a recent documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda said it was a realistic portrayal of what it's like to be a dancer. She thinks people don't understand how hard it is to be a dancer.

I asked her what makes a great dance production. She said it's when everything comes together - the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. It's okay if it's not perfect, but it's nice to aim high.

Miranda has done many different types of dance. People want to label her as a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist, but she doesn't like that. She wants to do different types of dance and keep learning.

Here's a simplified version of the text for a learner of English at level A2:

'I have a friend who asked me why I travel when I can watch TV at home. I said that TV is not the same as seeing things in real life. I decided to go on a crazy adventure to show that. A friend gave me his old sofa, and I fixed it up so I could sleep on it. I put my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa every night, even on the beach one night. Some friends joined me on the way and helped me pull the sofa along. This was a new kind of adventure for me. I walked a long way, but I could stop at cafes and rest on the sofa. People would ask me, ""Why are you doing this?"" and I would say, ""I'm not doing it for charity or training for a marathon. I just wanted to do something different."" Now, I like to tell people about my adventure instead of talking about TV shows.'

I made the following changes:

* Simplified vocabulary: I used shorter sentences and easier vocabulary to make the text more accessible to A2 learners.
* Reduced complexity: I removed some complex sentences and rephrased them to make them easier to understand.
* Removed idiomatic expressions: I replaced idiomatic expressions like ""get people to turn off their television sets"" with more literal language.
* Retained the core message: I kept the main idea of the text intact, focusing on the author's adventure and their desire to experience something new and different.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a learner of English at the A2 level:

'I read about a swimming trip in the sea around some small Greek islands. I was excited because I'd never gone on a group trip before. My brother was busy, so I decided to join a group. The man at the port was surprised when I asked for a single ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I told him I was joining a group of ten people to swim around the islands. He smiled and showed me on board.

We had talked to each other by email before we left, but there wasn't much time to chat before our first swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would be with us the whole time and showed us how to call for help if we needed it. We did a short swim to split us into groups, and then we did a longer swim. I was a bit nervous because I'd never swum so far in the sea before. The waves got bigger, and I was swimming with the slow group. I watched the faster swimmers ahead of me. I wanted to finish the swim, and I was happy when I did it on my own.

The next days were similar: we jumped in the water, swam at a comfortable pace, and stopped to look at the beautiful views. As the swims got longer, I got faster and enjoyed them more. I didn't need the support boat much. I'm looking forward to going again next year.'

""I'm not going to lie, being a flight attendant isn't easy. But I love my job. I've been to many countries, from the US to Australia. I work with nice people and have a lot of free time. It's a great job for young people like me. When I was a child, I used to travel alone to school, and I would help the flight attendants serve food to passengers. This made me happy. When I was tired of my old job, I wanted a change. I applied to be a flight attendant and was accepted. Many people were at the interview, and we were all changing careers. I prepared what to say before the interview. I didn't just say I loved to travel, like everyone else. I talked about my strengths and work experience. I got the job! I would recommend this job to anyone. There are many good things about it, like being able to travel and having a lot of free time. But the best thing is being part of a big family. We work hard, but we're close. When I'm not working, I don't have to think about work. And if I have difficult passengers, I know the flight will soon be over and I'll never see them again.""

'I work at a summer camp where I see children learn new things. Most kids know how to swim and play table tennis, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some kids are scared at first, but after a little encouragement, they try and succeed. This makes them very happy. Some kids miss their homes at first, especially those aged 10-13. We don't let them use their phones all the time. We let them phone home after lunch, and then again later in the day. Most kids get used to it quickly. At the end of the week, they all thank us for a great time. Not just the kids feel lonely. Sometimes parents call too much, asking how their child is doing. This is not necessary. Their child might be busy playing or doing something else. We tell parents to call back later. We get some kids who wear new, expensive clothes. These kids often argue when we tell them to change, but soon they understand why.'

Here is the simplified text for A2 level learners:

'Rock the Planet, a musical show, opened in London. It was in the USA for five years before coming to London. The show is very popular. The actors in the show are also musicians. But it was hard to find British actors who could do the show. In the USA, actors can do more shows. Here, they can only do half as many. So, the director needed to find twice as many actors. Luckily, he found some great British actors. The show has won an award. The theatre in London is big, but it's always full. People love the songs from the show.

I met a young actor named Jamie. He's 11 years old. He likes playing his guitar. He told me that he has to go to school during the day, but it's not the same as his old school. He misses his friends. His parents come to the show when they can, but it's expensive.

I also play guitar, so Jamie showed me his guitar and we played a song together. I was surprised at how well he played. I was happy to play along with him. The other young actors in the show are also good musicians. They didn't play in a band before, but they found it easy. The hard part was remembering to smile when they performed. The show will be in London for another year, and it's worth seeing.'<|eot_id|>"
