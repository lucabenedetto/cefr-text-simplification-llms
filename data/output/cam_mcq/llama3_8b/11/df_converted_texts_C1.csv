Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at level C1:

Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of sharing your location online. The site pointed out that by posting about where you are, you're also sharing your movements with many people you might not want to meet. This idea fits with the growing awareness that there may be downsides to sharing everything about our lives online. The internet offers many opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, but it can also be a treacherous place. In the early days of the internet, some pioneers explored these dangers and learned valuable lessons. They shared their experiences, including the risks of sharing too much, and the consequences of doing so.

One of these pioneers was Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student who started posting on the internet in 1994. He shared his life online, including photos and personal stories. In 1996, he began writing a daily blog, which became popular. Hall's philosophy was to share everything, and he included topics that others might consider private. Although his blog was considered reckless, it was also beautiful and artistic.

However, Hall's openness eventually led to problems. He fell in love and wrote about it on his blog, but his partner told him to choose between the blog and their relationship. Hall's blog was shut down, and he realized that sharing his life online had made people lose trust in him.

Another example is Heather Armstrong, a young woman who wrote a blog called Dooce. She wrote about her job and sometimes shared personal stories. However, an anonymous colleague sent her blog to her company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized. Armstrong lost her job as a result.

Experts have a term for this phenomenon: the ""online distribution effect."" It's the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. However, the internet is not a separate reality where we can be anonymous. Our online and offline lives are connected, and we need to be careful about what we share online.

Armstrong's story has a happy ending. She learned from her experience and eventually started a new blog focused on her family. She is now a successful ""mommy blogger"" and has learned to balance her online and offline life.

The main message is that while the internet allows us to share our lives with others, we need to be careful about what we share and think about the consequences.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level C1 on the CEFR:

Some scientists recently warned people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? The film combines documentary and drama to show that there's still much we don't understand about the universe. This is a fair point, as even the most confident scientists wouldn't claim to know everything. However, some scientists were so concerned that they publicly criticized the film, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""dangerous"". This made me curious, so I watched the film. At first, I didn't see what all the fuss was about. Scientists were simply saying that new discoveries are revealing the universe to be stranger than we thought. It wasn't until the film discussed some of these discoveries that I began to understand the controversy - discoveries like the ability of water molecules to be affected by thought.

I had heard of this idea before, but the film didn't provide convincing evidence. It showed pictures of ice crystals looking nice when someone was happy and nasty when someone was upset. Many people find this kind of evidence compelling, but scientists are skeptical. They want more proof before accepting such a claim. The film's claims were too good to be true, and the evidence wasn't sufficient.

However, the film wasn't entirely wrong. There are some amazing discoveries being made that show the universe is indeed stranger than we thought. For example, scientists have found that the universe is made up of a mysterious form of matter and energy that we don't fully understand. They have also discovered that our brains can delay our perception of events by half a second, and that our conscious mind is not always aware of what's really happening. These discoveries are astounding and show that science is still a long way from understanding everything.

In fact, many scientists believe that some natural phenomena can never be fully understood. The concepts of chaos and quantum uncertainty have shown that there are limits to what we can know. This has led some scientists to try to create a Theory of Everything, a single equation that explains all the forces and particles in the universe. Overall, the universe is an incredible place, and science is still uncovering its many secrets.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Shortened sentences and paragraphs to make them easier to follow
* Removed technical terms and jargon, replacing them with simpler language
* Simplified complex ideas and concepts, such as quantum uncertainty and the Theory of Everything
* Removed some of the author's personal opinions and biases to make the text more objective
* Changed the tone to be more neutral and informative, rather than critical or sarcastic.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at the C1 level:

Writing novels is a challenging task for me, while writing short stories is a joy. I find that writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure. The trees in the forest provide shade, and the wind rustles their leaves, which can be a beautiful golden colour. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colourful petals attract bees and butterflies, reminding us of the changing seasons.

As a fiction writer, I have always alternated between writing novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I feel the need to write some short stories, and after completing a group of short stories, I want to focus on a novel. I never work on short stories while writing a novel, and never start a novel while working on short stories. The two types of writing engage different parts of my brain, and it takes time to switch between them.

I started writing short stories in 1984, after publishing two short novels in 1975. At first, it was difficult, but I found the experience memorable. I felt my fictional world expand, and readers appreciated this new side of me as a writer. One of my earliest works, 'Breaking Waves', was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad.

I enjoy writing short stories because they don't take as long to finish as novels. It usually takes me about a week to get a short story in shape, although revisions can take longer. Writing short stories is a change of pace for me, and I find it necessary to avoid burnout. I also like that I can create a story from a small idea or image. It's like jazz improvisation, and the story takes me where it wants to go.

Another advantage of short stories is that I don't have to worry about failing. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write masterpieces. I can learn from my mistakes and use them in my next story. In fact, short stories are like an experimental laboratory for me as a novelist. Without them, I would find writing novels even more challenging.

My short stories are like footprints I've left behind, and I remember exactly where I set each one down. They are like guideposts to my heart, and I'm happy to share these intimate feelings with my readers.<|eot_id|>"

To simplify the text for a learner of level C1 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR), I will make minor changes to the vocabulary and sentence structure while preserving the factual content and coherence of the passage. Here is the revised text:

Science is a fascinating field that has both improved our lives and raised questions about the nature of the universe. It has helped us understand the world around us, from the smallest particles to the vastness of space. Science has also had a significant impact on society, influencing the work of poets, politicians, and philosophers. However, its importance has been both overestimated and underestimated, and its limitations are often overlooked.

The history of science has been marked by ongoing debates and conflicts. Established theories have been challenged and replaced by new ones, often after a period of ridicule and skepticism. Scientists have different personalities, and their work is not always free from personal biases and emotions.

This book will explore the key ideas in science that have shaped our understanding of the world and our place in it. While science has many practical applications, our focus will be on the ideas themselves, examining their beauty, complexity, and limitations. Science is constantly evolving, and new discoveries often challenge our existing knowledge.

In the past, science has led to significant advances, such as the discovery of radioactivity, X-rays, and the nucleus. Today, scientists are working on a theory of everything, a complete explanation of the universe and its workings. However, science is not just an intellectual pursuit; it has practical implications for our daily lives and the future of our planet.

As we move forward, it is essential for non-scientists to understand the advances in science and their potential impact on our world. Science is no longer just about observing nature; it is about controlling and shaping our future. The choices we make will affect our children's future and the future of our planet.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Simplified vocabulary: replaced complex words like ""perpetual conflict"", ""malevolently exaggerated"", ""ingenuity"", and ""fragility"" with more accessible alternatives like ""ongoing debates"", ""overlooked"", ""complexity"", and ""limitations"".
* Shortened sentences: broke up long sentences into shorter ones to improve readability and flow.
* Removed technical jargon: avoided using specialized terms like ""quantum mechanics"" and ""antimatter"" unless absolutely necessary.
* Emphasized key points: highlighted the main ideas and themes in the passage to help learners focus on the most important information.

Here is the simplified version of the text, adapted for a C1 level learner:

In recent years, the growth of ebook sales has slowed down, and some publishers have even reported a decline. This has raised doubts about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people think that the rise of ebooks may have led to unwise investments, and that the industry has lost faith in the power of physical books. Despite the fact that digital and print books can coexist, the question of whether ebooks will replace print books still sparks debate. This idea is powerful because it taps into our emotions and our fears about innovation and change.

The idea of one medium replacing another is not new. Before the invention of digital technologies, people predicted the demise of radio, television, and other media. However, these technologies often find new uses and adapt to changing circumstances. The idea of the disappearing book is not new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with audiobooks. This has happened many times before, and it's a natural reaction to technological change.

We form emotional bonds with different media, and when a new technology emerges, it can make us nostalgic for what we used to know. This is why we often see a resurgence of interest in older technologies, such as vinyl records or film cameras. The rise of e-readers has led to a new appreciation for physical books, including their smell and tactile qualities.

While the idea of the disappearing book may continue to spark debate, it also reflects our fascination with the transformative power of technology and our fear of change. We use familiar narrative patterns, such as stories of tragedy and endings, to make sense of change. The story of the death of the book is a powerful narrative that taps into our hopes and fears about the future.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Reduced the vocabulary and sentence complexity to make it more accessible to a C1 level learner

Here is the simplified text for a C1 level learner:

I spent almost two years researching how some of the most talented people of the past four hundred years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. I wanted to explore the everyday habits of famous individuals, such as when they woke up, ate, worked, and relaxed. By looking at these mundane details, I hoped to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers. As the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat and whether you take a nap, and I'll tell you how you work.""

This book is about the daily routines of creative people, not just their final products. It's about how they organized their time and schedules to achieve their goals. My own struggles with balancing creative work and earning a living inspired me to write this book. I wanted to know how others handled these challenges and how they managed to fit everything into their busy days.

The book is called Daily Rituals, but I focused more on people's routines than on their daily habits. A routine can be ordinary, but it can also be a powerful tool for achieving success. A good routine can help you make the most of your time, energy, and motivation. The psychologist William James believed that by forming good habits, you can free your mind to focus on more important things.

I was inspired to write this book after procrastinating on a project one Sunday afternoon. Instead of working, I started researching the daily routines of other writers and found it fascinating. I realized that someone should collect these stories in one place, so I created a blog and eventually, this book. The book includes a wide range of voices and stories, with quotes from letters, diaries, and interviews. I also relied on the research of other biographers, journalists, and scholars to help me write this book.

Howard became a palaeontologist because his family had to cancel their holiday to Spain when he was six years old. Instead, they went to the English coast and he found an ammonite on the beach. From then on, he knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist. As he grew older, he became more interested in the early history of the Earth and the fossils that tell us about it. He decided to focus on the earliest life forms, rather than the more famous dinosaurs. After completing his university studies, Howard wrote a PhD thesis and was looking for a job. He applied for a position at Tavistock College in London, but wasn't sure if he would get it. On the day of his interview, the professor who was supposed to chair the panel got into an argument with his wife and ended up in the hospital. The interview went ahead without him, and Howard was surprised to find out that he got the job. Later, he learned that the professor who replaced him had a personal vendetta against the previous professor and wanted to hire someone else. Howard was relieved to have the job, even if it wasn't exactly as he had hoped.

As he started his new job, Howard found that his professional life was very structured and predictable, but his personal life was more chaotic. He often felt that external factors could affect his life in unexpected ways, like when his briefcase was stolen at an Underground station. He had to cancel a lecture and report the theft to the authorities. Later, he met a colleague who told him about a new collection of fossils at the Natural History Museum in Nairobi, which could be his ticket to a major discovery and a secure career. Howard decided to make a big change and use all his resources to visit the museum and study the fossils.

Charles Spence is a professor of psychology at Oxford University. He is interested in how our senses work together to create the taste of food. He has studied how the way we eat, the company we keep, and even the noise around us can affect what we eat. Spence's research has had a big impact on the food industry. He works with big food companies to help them create new products and improve the taste of their food.

Spence's lab is not high-tech, but he is able to work with cooks and chefs to create new and interesting food combinations. He has worked with famous chefs, like Heston Blumenthal, to create new dishes. For example, they created a dish called ""The Sound of the Sea"" that used sound to enhance the flavor of the food.

Spence's research has shown that the way we eat can affect how much we enjoy our food. For example, eating with others can make us eat more. He has also found that the music we listen to can affect the taste of food. He has worked with companies to create music that complements the taste of their products.

In his free time, Spence likes to experiment with food and music at home. He has had dinner parties where they have used different sounds and music to enhance the taste of the food. He believes that the way we eat is closely connected to our senses and that by understanding how our senses work, we can create a more enjoyable eating experience.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level C1 on the CEFR:

Our brains are busier than ever before. We're constantly bombarded with information, some of which is accurate, some not. We need to sort through it all to find what's important and what we can ignore. At the same time, we're doing more tasks on our own, like booking flights and shopping online. We're doing the work of 10 people, all while trying to balance our personal and professional lives. Our smartphones are a key part of this. They help us stay connected and organized, but they also contribute to the constant feeling of being busy.

However, our brains are not designed to handle multiple tasks at once. We may think we're multitasking, but we're actually switching between tasks quickly, which can be costly. This can lead to decreased efficiency and increased stress. Multitasking has been shown to increase the production of stress hormones, making it harder to focus and think clearly.

In addition, our brains are easily distracted by new and shiny things. This can make it difficult to stay focused on one task. In fact, research has shown that having multiple tasks to complete at once can reduce our cognitive abilities and even lower our IQ.

The constant stream of information and the need to make quick decisions can also be overwhelming. We may feel like we're making good decisions, but in reality, we're often making poor choices because we're exhausted from making too many small decisions.

In the end, it's not the technology itself that's the problem, but the constant stream of information and the pressure to respond to it all. This can be overwhelming and make it difficult to get anything done.

In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino would break concrete into pieces at night and throw them at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other bats that can't find the right way to have their babies. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought animals just behaved and did things, and scientists recorded what they did. They didn't think animals had feelings or moral values. But now, scientists are studying the behavior of bats, chimpanzees, rats, dolphins, and chickens to learn more about their emotions.

This new research has led to a debate about whether animals have consciousness, or the ability to think and feel. This debate has also raised questions about whether animals have a moral sense, or a sense of right and wrong. For example, in a recent study, cows were given a task to open a locked gate to get food. The cows that could open the gate themselves seemed to enjoy it more than those that didn't. Does this mean that cows like to solve problems? This could have implications for how we treat and eat cows.

Some scientists think that this research means we should stop eating meat, while others think we should just learn more about animal cognition, or how animals think. There is no clear answer, and the debate is not just about science, but also about philosophy. It's hard to define what consciousness is, and it's even harder to know what it's like to be an animal.

'Critical thinking is a way to understand and analyze what we read or hear. Adrian West, a researcher, believes that argument is a way to find the truth. However, he also thinks that technology is changing the way we think. We are exposed to more information than ever before, but this can be overwhelming. As a result, our critical thinking skills may not be improving.

In fact, reading has declined significantly, and many people think that this is affecting our ability to think critically. Patricia Greenfield, a professor of psychology, believes that the emphasis on visual media, such as video games and television, is partly to blame. She thinks that these media can be entertaining, but they do not encourage deep thinking.

On the other hand, some researchers argue that technology can actually improve our critical thinking skills. For example, video games can teach us decision-making and analytical skills. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, believes that video games can be a useful tool for learning. He thinks that they can help us build smarter children with better reasoning skills.

In conclusion, technology is changing the way we think, and it's important to understand how it affects our critical thinking skills. While there are concerns about the impact of technology, it's also important to recognize its potential benefits.'

Matthew Crawford is a writer who used to work in social policy. He now works as a motorcycle mechanic because he got tired of office life. His books explore the benefits of manual work. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life. He was inspired to write it when he noticed that advertisements started appearing on his credit card machine while he was waiting for it to process. He realized that it's getting harder to focus on what's important because of all the distractions around us.

We're constantly being interrupted by things like video games and social media. These distractions make us feel like we're in control, but they're actually taking over our lives. Crawford is not the only one who thinks this. Many people are worried about the impact of technology on our attention span.

Some people think that our attention span has been affected by technology since the invention of the telegraph. However, it's clear that we're more aware of the things we might be doing. Crawford thinks that technology has created the perfect way for us to be self-absorbed. With so many choices available, we're constantly trying to manage our time and attention.

This has a social impact. We're more likely to send a text message than have a real conversation. Crawford thinks that this is making us lose something fundamental in our society. Screens are just part of the problem. He gives the example of a gym, where people used to listen to music together, but now everyone listens to their own music on headphones. This has made the gym a less social place.

Crawford suggests that we need to regulate noise and distractions in public spaces. More importantly, he thinks we need to develop skills that allow us to engage with the world in a more satisfying way. He gives the examples of a cook, an ice-hockey player, and a motorbike rider, who all have to deal with the physical world. These skills help us develop good judgment and the ability to work with others.

When we focus on real things, we realize that manufactured experiences are not as fulfilling. This is not just about finding a new job, but about developing the ability to pay attention to what's important. By resisting distractions, we can actually improve our ability to focus on what matters.

Here is the simplified version of the text, adapted for a C1 level learner:

'What do you do for a living?' is a common question that often gets a quick answer. However, when you're a philosopher, it's a bit more complicated. Saying you're a philosopher can sound pretentious, as if you're claiming to have some kind of special knowledge. But philosophers are just ordinary people who think deeply about the world. So, why do people think philosophers are so special? One reason is that philosophers have a reputation for judging others and valuing intellectual pursuits. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of contemplation was the most virtuous one. Many modern philosophers wouldn't agree, but the idea persists.

Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that an unexamined life isn't worth living. This means that a life that simply follows the crowd without questioning anything can be unsatisfying. Our ability to reflect on the world allows us to make our own decisions and take control of our lives. But examining our lives doesn't require reading philosophy books or being a genius. It's about taking a closer look at our daily experiences to make sure they're worth our time.

Philosophy has become a profession, and as a result, many philosophers focus on specialized areas of study and write for other experts. This can make it seem like philosophy is only for academics. However, philosophy should be relevant to everyone's life. It's about exploring the big questions and thinking deeply about the world around us.

I often describe myself as an ethicist, because my work focuses on ethics, which is the part of philosophy that explores what's right and wrong. However, I've started to feel that this title doesn't capture the full range of my work. Ethics is often associated with rules and laws, but philosophy is about more than just deciding what's right or wrong. It's about understanding the world and our place in it. By exploring these big questions, philosophy can help us think more deeply about our lives and make better choices.'

Food and eating have often been neglected in philosophical discussions, despite being a fundamental part of human experience. Historically, philosophers have used food as a metaphor for other topics, such as the pursuit of knowledge. However, food is not just a means to an end; it is a complex and multifaceted aspect of human culture.

Epicurus, an ancient Greek philosopher, advocated for the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, but his ideas have been misinterpreted and applied to food and drink alone. This highlights the importance of understanding the cultural and social context of food.

Food is not just a personal preference, but a shared experience that brings people together. It is often associated with community, tradition, and identity. Food critics and writers may have a privileged status, but their expertise is not necessarily in taste, but rather in describing the experience of eating.

Philosophers have neglected the aesthetics of food, despite the rise of modern gastronomy. Food is often destroyed in the process of consumption, making it difficult to appreciate its aesthetic value. However, some philosophers argue that food can be considered an aesthetic object, similar to sculpture or poetry.

Ethical issues surrounding food are also important, such as what we should eat and why. These questions often reveal our values and beliefs. Philosophers may debate the answers to these questions, exploring the ethical implications of our food choices.

Cooking in restaurants and at home can also be seen as having different ethical implications. Home cooks have a special duty to their guests, while professional chefs have obligations to their employers and the food itself. This highlights the importance of considering the context in which food is prepared and consumed.

Food can also play a role in bridging cultural gaps, whether through learning to appreciate different cuisines or sharing meals with people from other cultures. This can be seen in the ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" essay, which explores the ways in which food can bring people together.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 level learner:

Rob Daviau, an American game designer, created 'legacy' board games. He wanted to make games more exciting and challenging. He started by modifying a classic game called Risk, creating Risk Legacy. In this version, players' decisions had a permanent impact. They might have to tear up cards or damage the board. The game is played over several sessions, and players' choices affect the game's outcome.

Daviau was asked to work on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular cooperative game. His next project was a game called SeaFall, set in the age of sail. In this game, players become seafarers, exploring a new world. Legacy game designers must consider all possible player choices to ensure the story remains coherent. They test the games with players to see how they unfold.

When developing the concept, Daviau expected it to be a niche interest. However, many players loved the idea. Russell Chapman, a fan, considers it a major innovation in game design. Ben Hogg, another fan, likes the sense of adventure and excitement it provides.

The legacy format draws inspiration from video games and the popularity of episodic TV shows. Daviau, who initially wanted to be a TV writer, saw parallels between game design and storytelling. Matt Leacock, creator of Pandemic, compares the legacy design process to writing a novel. Daviau hopes others will build upon his idea, but he also wants to see what new innovations come next. Colby Dauch, a game publisher, believes the legacy format has revolutionized the way people think about board games.

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at a New Zealand aquarium. He slid across the floor and slipped into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was widely shared online and was like something out of a children's film. We enjoy imagining that animals are like us, and this is especially true for octopuses. They are highly intelligent, but their bodies are very different from ours. How can creatures with eight tentacles open jars, recognize faces, and even play like humans? Some people think it's unscientific to attribute human-like qualities to animals, but Dr. Frans de Waal disagrees. He believes that it's actually the opposite - an unwillingness to recognize the human-like traits of animals - that is unscientific. He has studied primates and other animals and found that they exhibit many behaviors that were previously thought to be unique to humans, such as considering the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding other animals' motives. In other words, animals are much smarter than we often give them credit for.

Dr. de Waal believes that this limited view of animal intelligence is a relatively recent phenomenon. In the past, people thought animals were intelligent enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even Charles Darwin, the famous naturalist, believed that the difference between human and animal intelligence was one of degree, not kind. However, the development of behaviorism in the 20th century led to a shift in public perception of animal intelligence. Many people began to view animals as either stimulus-response machines or robots with useful instincts. Anyone who thought animals had internal lives was seen as romantic or unscientific.

Fortunately, Dr. de Waal believes that we are moving away from this limited view and recognizing that animal cognition is on the same spectrum as human cognition, even if it's not at the same level. The most effective tests of animal intelligence are designed with the species' unique traits and skills in mind. For example, squirrels may not do well on human memory tests, but they can remember where they've hidden nuts. In her book, Sy Montgomery notes that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might test us on the number of color patterns we can produce on our skin. Seeing us struggle, it might conclude that we're not very intelligent.

Dr. de Waal is skeptical of Inky's escape story, but he acknowledges the power of viral stories to raise awareness of animal intelligence. He once ran an experiment to test whether capuchin monkeys can experience envy. The monkeys were given cucumbers or grapes as rewards, and those given cucumbers became upset when they saw their peers get the better reward. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a one-minute video clip of the experiment released ten years later really brought the findings to the public's attention. This is just one of the quirks of the human animal mind.<|eot_id|>"

'Robotics is expected to have a profound impact on the way we live and work. While robots have been used in industries like manufacturing and automotive for a long time, experts predict that they will soon be used in many other areas. This change will be significant, and many people are not prepared for it. Some people think that robots will take over most jobs currently done by humans in the next 50 years, but surprisingly, many people also believe that their current jobs will remain unchanged. However, this is unlikely. Every industry will be affected by robotic automation in the coming years.

For example, a company in Australia has developed a robot that can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, which would take two human bricklayers a day or more to do. Another robot, called Tally, is used in supermarkets to check that shelves are fully stocked and priced correctly.

Some people think that the development of robots will create new, well-paid jobs for technicians and programmers. However, others are concerned that the loss of human interaction in the workplace will have a negative impact on society.

Dr Jing Bing Zhang, an expert on the commercial applications of robotics, believes that the key to adapting to this change is for people to retrain themselves and acquire new skills. He also predicts that the demand for skilled workers in the robotics industry will increase, but there will be a shortage of workers to fill these jobs.

In the future, we can expect to see robots that are more advanced and capable of interacting with us in new ways. This will create new opportunities for companies, but also raises concerns about safety and privacy. To prepare for this change, it is essential that we focus on education, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM), to ensure that we have the skills needed to compete in the job market.'

Climbers often face questions about why they risk their lives to climb mountains. One famous climber, George Mallory, replied, ""Because it's there."" This answer is simple, yet it challenges people to think about what drives them to take on such a dangerous pursuit. Climbing can be a thrilling adventure, and many people find it enjoyable. However, it can also be a confining and restrictive activity, as climbers often face harsh weather conditions and limited options.

In his essay ""Games that Climbers Play"", the Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores identified seven types of climbing activities, each with its own set of rules. He argued that the style of climbing depends on the specific game being played. Over time, this approach has become widely accepted in the Western climbing community.

For many climbers, the freedom and sense of liberation they experience while climbing is a major draw. However, this freedom can also be limited by the physical and emotional demands of climbing. Climbers may feel trapped in a tent during a storm, for example, which is not what they expected from the experience.

In his essay, US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests that we should ask ""Why do people climb?"" rather than ""Why climb?"" He argues that climbing is an innate human desire to take on challenges and test our limits. Climbing is a natural part of human nature, and the pleasures we get from it are rooted in biology.

US academic Brian Treanor believes that climbing can help develop important virtues such as courage, humility, and respect for the environment. He argues that these virtues are essential in today's risk-averse society. Climbing can also serve a practical purpose, helping us develop the traits and virtues necessary to live well in the non-climbing world.

Some climbers believe that those who climb independently, without relying on others or technology, are more committed to their goal and therefore deserve greater recognition for their achievements. However, this idea has sparked controversy, as it may encourage some climbers to take unnecessary risks.

Climbing can also be a meditative experience, allowing climbers to be in the moment and connect with nature. This aspect of climbing has been compared to Zen philosophy, which aims to train the mind towards a state of perfect peace.

These are just a few of the many reasons why people are drawn to climbing. Ultimately, the answer to ""Why climb?"" is complex and personal, and may vary from person to person.<|eot_id|>"

For over 60 years, pianist Alfred Brendel was a dominant figure in classical music. He was a serious and reserved person who focused on playing and recording well-known European piano pieces. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he didn't teach much. Those who knew him noticed that he had a playful side, but this wasn't often seen in his concerts. His life was a constant cycle of studying, traveling, and performing. Four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after a concert and asked for lessons. At first, Brendel wasn't interested, but he was impressed by Kit's skills. Kit played the piano very well and from memory. He even brought a CD of one of his performances, which impressed Brendel. Brendel decided to take Kit on as a student, noting that Kit had a rare ability to play with subtlety and overview.

As Brendel is retiring, Kit is starting to make a name for himself. Brendel is careful not to push him too hard, as he worries about Kit burning out. Kit is a restless person who enjoys learning new things, such as languages, math, and computer programming. He also composes music. Brendel praises Kit's ability to listen to his own playing and to learn quickly. However, he cautions against expecting too much too soon, as Kit still has much to learn.

At 80 years old, Brendel looks back on his career with a sense of satisfaction. He never sought to be famous, but rather focused on achieving certain goals by a certain age. Although he no longer performs, he still has many pieces he wants to play in his head. He sees his post-performing career as a new and enjoyable chapter in his life.

'I never thought of gardens as anything less than perfect places when I was young. My grandfather's garden was special. It was by a river and sloped gently down to the water. You couldn't reach the river, but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds singing in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this - a place to escape, relax, and be alone. My grandfather's garden wasn't special in terms of features. He didn't have a greenhouse like some of his neighbours, who had made their own from old window frames. My father was a quiet person, but he had a sense of humour. He liked to use funny phrases, such as 'It's immaterial to me'. Deep down, he was probably disappointed that he hadn't achieved more in life. He left school without qualifications and became an apprentice plumber, which wasn't his passion. He was never ambitious, but he had a moment when he thought of moving to Canada. However, it didn't happen. What he was good at was fixing things around the house. He had an eye for detail and could do amazing jobs. My parents only moved house once, but my mother loved to change the furniture. When a piano arrived, I was intimidated by it, but I liked the two brass candlesticks on the front. My sister took lessons, but I never got to play. My mother said I wouldn't have practiced. I preferred the river to the moors or woods. I loved walking along the riverbank, imagining another world. I would take a fishing net and walk along, looking for a spot to take off my sandals and explore. I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father said there was a job available as an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. He might have preferred it if I became a carpenter, but I think he hoped things would work out for the best if I stuck with gardening.'

Lawrence MacEwen lives on a small island called the Isle of Muck, off the west coast of Scotland. I visit him there and find him surrounded by his sheepdog, Tie. The wind is strong, but he seems completely at ease. He shows me around the island, pointing out the surrounding islands and explaining that it rains more on one of them than on Muck. We go down to the shore, where he tells me about the island's history and geology. Suddenly, he needs to move his sheep, so we set off across the hills.

As we walk, he tells me more about the island, including its volcanic origins and the fact that his family has lived there for 3,000 years. We encounter some sheep and Tie, the dog, who is not very good at herding. MacEwen is disappointed, but Tie looks sorry.

The island is a family business. Lawrence's wife, Jenny, helps him with the farm, while their son, Colin, manages the island cottages. Their daughter, Mary, runs the hotel with her husband, Toby. The family loves that their children can explore the island and sail boats in the summer. However, island life has its challenges, such as limited electricity and no mobile phone signal. I have to get used to this, but it's not too difficult.

One day, a boat arrives with some groceries and three musicians who play a concert in the tearoom. The islanders enjoy the music and dance along. In the evening, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. Her father bought a farm on another island without even visiting it, and Jenny was sent to manage it. She had good typing skills, but no experience with farming.

I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more of the same. However, I enjoy the food, which is all locally sourced. I go to the fisherman, Sandy Mathers, to collect some fresh fish, which Mary cooks for dinner. The next morning, I take the ferry to my next destination. Many of the ferries had been cancelled due to bad weather, so I'm relieved to be leaving. Despite the challenges of island life, I secretly wish I could stay longer.

The video game industry used to be a niche field, mainly attracting computer scientists and self-taught individuals. However, it's now gaining recognition as a serious profession. Industry experts agree that getting into the industry can be challenging, but it's expanding. To succeed, you need to be skilled, persistent, and knowledgeable about the intricacies of game design.

Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for an online games magazine, emphasizes the importance of making games to get noticed. He believes that having a degree in computer science is not essential, but having a portfolio of your work is crucial. John Field, another industry expert, agrees that making games is the best way to get started, but notes that it's not as simple as just ""doing it"". He highlights the need for creative talent, technical skills, and entrepreneurial ability to succeed in the industry.

John also suggests that a postgraduate course in game design can be helpful, providing guidance and support. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They often have a passion for entertainment media, arts, and culture, and are eager to explore the future possibilities of games. Networking is also crucial, as it can help you get ahead in the industry.

The stereotype of a teenager glued to a console has given way to a more accurate perception of games as a medium that appeals to people of all ages. Families play together on consoles, and smartphones offer a wide range of games through apps and social media. John believes that the industry has plenty of room for growth, as games are becoming a popular way to learn and entertain.

My friend eventually stopped playing football altogether. I'm glad it wasn't like that for me. When I score a goal from far away, people often say it's just luck, but it's not. I've worked hard on my shooting skills since I was young. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also need years of practice. When I teach children, I try to show them how to enjoy learning new skills. I was involved in many sports at school, but football was my main focus. I want my son to have a good education and enjoy playing sports, but not be too focused on one thing. At the beginning of my professional football career, our manager made sacrifices so we could play for the first team. We knew we had to work hard, but he didn't make a big deal about it. We lost our first game of the season, and a famous TV presenter said we couldn't win anything with young players. That made us realize how much we had to improve. I rely on my close friends and family, but having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. I've helped my parents financially, but I want to make sure they know they're not on my payroll. After I stop playing football, I plan to take a break and do things I haven't had time for before, like skiing.'

She had been advised by her friend Annie to arrive late, but this time it didn't seem to be a good idea. The queue wasn't moving, and an announcement came over the loudspeaker saying that there was a problem with the computer system. The atmosphere among the passengers became gloomy, and some people even got annoyed. They had paid a lot of money for this cruise and didn't want to waste their time.

Violet was feeling frustrated and worried. She couldn't find her phone, which was very annoying. She also realized that she had made a mistake by booking this cruise. She couldn't even call the taxi company to check if she had left her phone there because all her numbers were stored in the phone.

Behind her in the queue, Violet met a friendly couple who were also having trouble with their phones. She borrowed their phone to call her son Harry and ask him to check if her phone was left in the taxi. She was relieved to have found a solution, but she was still worried about being without her phone in New York.

As the queue started moving, Violet handed over her travel documents and boarded the ship. She was disappointed by the ship's foyer, which looked like a hotel that was trying too hard to be grand.

When John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, he had no idea he was about to uncover the work of Vivian Maier, a talented street photographer. Maloof was looking for pictures to use in a book about a neighborhood in Chicago, but instead, he found over 30,000 images taken by Maier. Since then, Maloof has collected many of Maier's cameras, films, and prints, as well as some movies and audio recordings. He is now working with his friend Anthony Rydzon to learn more about Maier's life and work.

Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent part of her childhood in France. She moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. Despite being a private person, Maier was always taking pictures with her camera, which was often around her neck. She was interested in art, movies, and politics, and her photographs reflect this. Her work is unique because it was not done for commercial reasons, but rather because she loved taking pictures.

Maier's photographs are of people, street scenes, and abstract compositions. Photography expert Larry Silverman believes that her work was influenced by other photographers, but he is not sure if she developed her own style independently.

Eleanor Catton's novel, The Luminaries, is a big and ambitious book. When she was interviewed, she seemed calm, despite being in the middle of a whirlwind of publicity. She told me a story about being stopped at passport control and being asked to prove she was a writer. She showed them her book and they asked what it was about. This is not an easy question for an author!

The book is set in New Zealand in the 1860s. There have been some crimes, and a group of 12 men has been brought together to solve them. The story gets very complicated. Catton started writing a murder mystery, but found that the past offered many opportunities for misunderstandings and complications for her characters.

The book is over 800 pages long, which is big because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a fair share of the story. When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at such a young age, she said that it's nice because everyone in her small country feels like they have a part in her success. She also said that what's annoying is when people assume that she's not trying to do something meaningful with her book.

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in a special way, like a spiral. Each part gets shorter than the previous one, and it speeds up as it goes. I asked if it matters if readers notice these things, and she said that she wanted to create a book with hidden patterns that readers could discover if they wanted to.

Despite the unusual structure of the book, it's still a thrilling murder mystery with a great plot. Interestingly, Catton didn't plan everything out beforehand. She would write herself into a difficult situation and then try to think of a way out. She also wanted to make the book fun to read.

We talked about her love of TV drama series, and how The Luminaries has cliffhangers, multiple viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she might be interested in writing for TV, and she thought it could be cool. She's very enthusiastic when talking about her work and New Zealand. She loves how being in a different place can change her imagination. For now, she plans to stay in New Zealand, which she hopes will continue to inspire her for many more novels.<|eot_id|>"

He learned to play his brother's guitar at 11 and later built his own bass guitar at 16. Jonny's passion for guitar-making started with his childhood hobby of customizing and repairing instruments for his friends.

After finishing school, Jonny studied architecture at university, but he dropped out halfway through. He realized that his true passion was guitar-making, which he saw as a form of sculpture that involved creating something functional and beautiful. Jonny started making guitars for a living, initially supplementing his income by cleaning windows part-time. As he gained a reputation for his high-quality instruments, he was able to charge more for his work.

Jonny believes that developing a career as a guitar-maker is easier today than it was when he started. He thinks that taking instrument-making courses can be helpful, but also emphasizes the importance of trial and error.

Discussing English conversation, it's common to start with the weather. This is because, as the famous diarist Dr Johnson noted, when two English people meet, they often talk about the weather first. However, many commentators fail to explain why English people are so interested in the weather. They assume that we talk about it because we're fascinated by the subject. But this is not the case.

The American writer Bill Bryson, for example, thinks that the English weather is not exciting or unpredictable, so it's hard to understand why we're so obsessed with it. The English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees, saying that the interest in the weather is not about the weather itself, but about its uncertainty.

My research suggests that both Bryson and Paxman are missing the point. English conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all. Instead, they're a way for people to break the ice and start talking to each other. We use fixed phrases like ""Nice day, isn't it?"" or ""Ooh, it's cold!"" as a way to greet each other or to fill an awkward silence.

These phrases are not about getting information about the weather; they're a way to show social bonding and build relationships. There are specific situations where we use weather-speak, such as when we meet someone new, when we're not sure what to say, or when the conversation is dying down. It's easy to see why people might think that English people are obsessed with the weather, but really, it's just a way for us to connect with each other.

The students were interested, having chosen this trip over more popular destinations like Spain, Greece, or France. However, they wanted to know why the wall was built. Alice found it hard to answer their questions and decided to write a historical novel to add context and make the story more engaging. After 31 years of teaching, Alice retired and started writing in 2001. She found that writing was a new and exciting challenge, but also a bit scary. Her former colleagues were envious of her new career, as she was still able to connect with children through her writing.

Alice's main goal is to fill a gap in children's fiction. She wants her books to be different from the ones that focus on negative experiences or pure fantasy. She believes that her writing is an extension of her teaching, and she loves seeing children become interested and engaged in a subject.

'To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, professional triathletes, to participate in a unique competition. They would race to the same point, but in different ways. Jonny would drive a car on roads, while Alistair would ride a mountain bike across country. The brothers were excited about the challenge. Jonny said, ""I've never done anything like this before. It's going to be exciting! The roads have beautiful views, and it's very cold, so I'll be able to stay warm in the car."" Alistair was also eager, but he was dressed in full winter cycling gear. He wasn't worried about the cold, though. ""To be honest, I've seen Jonny drive before, so I'm not sure he'll make it. I might even stop for a cup of tea halfway up.""

The race started at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and finished at Yorkshire's highest road, Fleet Moss, which is 350 meters above sea level. The car could easily make it to the finish, but Alistair's first few miles were very challenging, with a steep 25% incline. As Alistair sprinted away on his bike, Jonny got into his car and started driving. They wouldn't see each other again until the finish line.

The only question was, who would get there first? Jonny's confidence was high at first, but it quickly dropped when he faced his first obstacle - a tractor blocking the road. ""Welcome to Yorkshire,"" he joked to the cameraman in the back of his car. ""If Alistair beats me, it's all because of this farmer!""

Alistair, meanwhile, was struggling with the steep hill. He had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill, over fences and walls. The sheep looked on, amused by the sight of an Olympic champion struggling to carry his bike. Finally, he reached the top of the hill and was able to ride again. Jonny, on the other hand, faced more obstacles on the road, including a narrow corner and a stream that had formed on the road.

As they approached the finish line, neither brother knew how close the other was. Jonny roared his engine and sped to the finish, while Alistair flew across the final field and onto the road. He reached the finish line, looked up, and asked, ""Is he here?"" The crowd told him Jonny wasn't there yet, and Alistair raised his arms in victory.

When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, the silence is striking. You bounce the ball on the soft grass, serve, and hit it, and all you hear is the echo of your own shots. The trimmed grass, the history of the stadium, and the players in white, all create a sense of isolation from the outside world. The quiet of the Centre Court helps me focus on the game. What I struggle with most is to block out everything except the match and the point I'm playing. The silence is broken only by applause and cheers when a point is finished. I'm so focused that I don't even notice the 15,000 people watching me, or the millions around the world who are following the match.

I had always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My coach, my uncle Toni, had told me since I was young that this was the biggest tournament of all. By the time I was 14, I was sharing my dream with friends that I would play here one day and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost twice, both times against Roger Federer. The loss in 2006 wasn't so bad, but the one in 2007 was devastating. I knew I could have done better, and it wasn't my ability or game that let me down, but my head. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room after that loss. Losing hurts, but it hurts more when you have a chance and throw it away.

My coach, Toni, is usually tough and doesn't offer me comfort, even when I win. But after that loss, he told me not to cry, that there would be more Wimbledons and more finals. I told him he didn't understand, that this might be my last chance. I know that as a professional athlete, my time is limited, and I want to make the most of it. Every moment counts, but some moments count more than others. I had let a big one slip away in 2007.

Toni was right, though. I got another chance a year later. I was confident that I had learned from my mistakes and would not let my head get in the way this time. The best sign of this was my conviction that I would win. The night before the final, at dinner with family and friends, we didn't talk about the match. I didn't want to think about it, but I was already playing it out in my head. From now on, that space in my head should be mine alone.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level C1 on the CEFR:

Jane Goodall, a young English woman, arrived in Africa in 1957. She was excited to be in the place she had always dreamed of. She spent most of her life in Africa and became famous for her work with chimpanzees. Goodall's research changed the way people understand these animals. Before her work, people didn't know that chimpanzees ate meat, used tools, or had emotions like humans. She also discovered that chimpanzees have their own cultures and ways of living.

Goodall's book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe, is considered the most important book on chimpanzee research. Her study of chimpanzees in Tanzania helped us understand these animals better and changed the way we think about ourselves. Even as a child, Goodall showed signs of her future career as a biologist. When she was five years old, she crawled into a henhouse to see how hens lay eggs. This incident might be seen as the start of her journey as a scientist.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

1. Simplified sentence structure: I broke down long, complex sentences into shorter, simpler ones.
2. Reduced vocabulary: I replaced technical terms like ""National Geographical Society"" with more general language like ""a famous organization"".
3. Removed unnecessary details: I omitted some details that were not essential to the main message of the text.
4. Changed tone: I maintained a neutral tone, focusing on presenting the facts about Jane Goodall's life and work in a clear and concise manner.

The changes I made should not affect the answerability of the questions associated with the text, as the main ideas and facts remain the same.<|eot_id|>"

Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist who can mimic many different voices. She can sound like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an elderly Scottish woman, and even a fast-talking alien. She has worked on various projects, including children's TV shows, cartoons, and educational videos. Shirley explains that doing voiceovers requires more than just being able to make funny voices. It's about bringing the script to life for the audience and making it engaging.

Shirley started her career in acting, but she discovered that she was good at doing voices and decided to focus on voiceover work. She has worked on many projects, including cartoons, where she often plays the voices of children. She has learned to create different voices by watching children's TV shows and by using her own imagination.

Shirley believes that a good showreel is essential for getting work as a voiceover artist. She recommends attending specialist workshops and having a passion for human sound. She is obsessed with voices and enjoys becoming the characters she is performing.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of English at level C1 (CEFR):

Many people ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a dream job that people often have as children, like becoming a race car driver. However, most people give up on these childhood fantasies and choose more realistic careers, like being a lawyer or working in manufacturing. The idea of making a living by drawing simple doodles is, when you think about it, quite silly. Yet, some people do make a living doing just that.

I became a cartoonist in a typical way. I studied graphic design in college and then showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted political cartoons on local issues. I drew some ideas and they bought them. Within a few months, I was making enough money to support myself.

You don't need a university degree, a lot of money, or even drawing skills to become a cartoonist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to make marks. However, it's not an easy job. You need to be passionate about it and willing to work hard.

I've done various types of cartoons, such as political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also written, caricatured, and designed. I believe that the more things you know how to do well, the more chance you have of making a living with your art.

In the past, many cartoonists could find regular jobs doing cartoons for several newspapers and magazines. However, those days are almost gone. Today, cartooning is mostly an entrepreneurial activity, which means you need to produce and sell your work. It's essential to be comfortable with the business side of things.

I've seen cartoonists with average creative skills but excellent business skills do better than those with exceptional artistic talent but poor business skills. Many cartoonists are worried about someone stealing their ideas, but it's not a big deal. You can protect your work by adding a 'c' for 'copyright' and your name and date. However, it's more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal your cartoon and it becomes popular, it can be a lucky break!

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at level C1 on the CEFR:

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and decided to get rid of some old things. I threw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. I was surprised because I usually don't like getting rid of things, especially not something as valuable as a guitar. A young man saw me throwing it away and asked if I was sure I wanted to get rid of it. I said yes, but then felt a pang of regret. He asked if he could have it, and I agreed. Later, I felt a constant sadness about what I had done.

Then, a few months ago, I received an email from a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He told me that he had found my old guitar and was willing to sell it back to me. I was overjoyed and relieved. It turned out that the guitar had been sold several times after I gave it away.

I remembered that my dad used to put labels on all my belongings, including my guitar. Keith found this label and used it to find me online. He contacted me through my work and offered to sell the guitar back to me at a fair price.

I was so happy to have my guitar back that I almost cried. I had forgotten all about my dad's habit of labeling my things. My parents had always wanted me to learn classical guitar, but I never made much progress. I switched to electric guitar and played simple music.

When I took my guitar out of the box, I remembered my 16th birthday, when my parents gave it to me. It felt smooth and familiar in my hands, and I started playing without thinking. I realized that I had forgotten how to play, but my fingers knew the chords instinctively. I think I'll start a band with my son, who is learning the saxophone. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!

Here is a revised version of the text, simplified for a learner of English at the C1 level:

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. When I wrote my book about people who can't sleep, I felt like I was warning people about the dangers of not getting enough sleep. Sleep is crucial for our mental, physical, and social well-being. Those who struggle to sleep understand just how important it is. It's great that sleep is getting more attention. However, I'm surprised that dreams haven't been discussed much. We're losing our dreams all the time. When we wake up early, we sacrifice the last hour or two of sleep, which is mainly REM sleep, the stage when we have our most vivid and memorable dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM. When researchers deprive people of REM, they experience an increase in REM the next night. This suggests that dreams are important.

Researchers have been studying dreams since 1953, when they discovered REM sleep. Initially, they thought that interpreting dreams could help us understand how our minds work, but this idea was later disproven. Today, there is little agreement among researchers about the purpose of dreams. However, a study found that people who use their dreams, such as actors, writers, and directors, have a better ability to remember and use their dreams. This makes sense, as film is a creative process that requires imagination.

But I wonder if creative types are the only ones who benefit from their dreams. Don't we all need to think creatively in our daily lives? Dreams can help us bring together new ideas and find new patterns. For example, researchers have found that when people are awakened from REM sleep and asked to respond to a word, their answers are more original than when they are awakened from other stages of sleep. This is what creativity is all about.

I've noticed that when I wake up from a vivid dream, I write better. Even a troubling dream can provide a spark of creativity. This is why we need to dream. In today's complex world, we all need to think creatively and flexibly to navigate our relationships and daily lives.<|eot_id|>"

It's been twenty years since Susie Ray left London and moved to a small coastal town in southwest England. Her studio has an incredible sea view, and as you walk in, you'll notice empty frames on the walls between photos of her two daughters. As a renowned copyist artist, it's surprising that she doesn't have any of her own work displayed. 'I don't have any of my own work around,' she says with a shrug. 'As soon as I finish a piece, it goes to my clients.'

Susie has spent the last thirty years reproducing the works of famous artists, including Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so accurate that art experts often mistake them for the originals. While the originals can sell for millions, Susie's reproductions fetch between a few hundred pounds and £12,000, depending on the time she spends on each piece.

Susie's clients are mostly galleries and private collectors, and she doesn't reveal their identities. Some collectors use her copies as a status symbol, and she's aware that some even pass off her work as the original. However, she's never been tempted to do the same, as it's illegal.

Susie has always been open about her work, and she believes that reproducing a masterpiece accurately is essential. She signs her name on the back of the canvas to distinguish her work from the original. She's had her own struggles, but her situation is more secure now, and she wouldn't risk damaging her reputation.

Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She stresses the importance of learning to draw accurately and emphasizes the value of her years of study. She's now specialized in reproducing French impressionist paintings, with Manet, Cezanne, and Degas being her favorites.

Susie notes that people often underestimate the difficulty of reproducing impressionist paintings, which require both speed and precision. Despite her skills, she doesn't create her own original work, preferring to focus on her reproductions. While she has occasionally tried her hand at creating her own art, she's realized that it's not her strength. She's content with making a good living from her reproductions and is proud of her expertise.

Ellen MacArthur's passion was the sea, and being the fastest person on its surface. As a sailor, she had a special connection with her boats. After racing, she felt restless and wanted to be back out on the water, testing herself against nature. After finishing second in a solo, non-stop round-the-world race, she took me on a tour of her boat, Kingfisher, which had been her home, workplace, and life support system for 94 days. She showed me how she planned every detail, from food to medical supplies. Her boat was her world, and she took care of it because her life depended on it.

Now, Ellen sees the world as a fragile, beautiful thing that needs to be protected. Her turning point came when she helped with a bird survey on a desolate island in the South Atlantic. Seeing abandoned whaling stations made her realize how we take and use resources without thinking about the consequences. She believes we need to design a way to use resources sustainably, rather than just using them up.

Ellen emphasizes the importance of reusing and reducing waste. She has been touring factories, mines, and power stations, talking to governments and businesses about our reliance on non-renewable resources. She has also launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works to educate young people about sustainable living.

Ellen misses the adventure of sailing, but she believes her new mission is more important. She says, ""I may have been the fastest person round the world, but this beats everything I've ever done.""<|eot_id|>"

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to be the youngest person to climb Mount Everest. If he succeeds, he might become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Jordan hopes to inspire young people to spend more time outdoors, rather than just playing computer games. His team, which includes his parents, Paul and Karen, is planning the climb. They are not only aiming to climb Everest, but also to reach the highest point on each continent, a feat known as the Seven Summits. Jordan has already climbed five of these peaks and is close to completing the challenge.

Some experienced climbers have expressed doubts about taking a 13-year-old on such a dangerous expedition. They think that a young climber might not have the emotional strength or experience to make good decisions and stay safe. Jordan's parents have heard these concerns before, but they are confident in their son's abilities and believe their own experience as climbers will help them navigate any challenges.

Jordan's motivation for the climb is not just about becoming famous. He has always been interested in adventure and wants to inspire others to try new things. However, he also knows that he needs to make his achievement public in order to inspire others. This means sharing his experience through social media and interviews. His parents are supportive of his decision and will stop the project if Jordan loses interest or decides to pursue a different hobby.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 level learner:

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's unlikely they're listening to classical music. Most people know many pop group names, but ask your friends if they know who Brahms was and you'll see a confused expression. I'm studying music, but my classmates don't know much about classical music either. If you don't know who wrote the music, you're unlikely to buy their recordings. The statistics are concerning for classical music lovers. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells only 300 copies. I find this hard to believe. So, what has caused this decline in interest for music that has been around for centuries? The older generation blames our obsession with TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is that classical music just doesn't appeal to most people, especially teenagers who are likely to buy music and concert tickets. I'm aware that not everyone my age dislikes classical music. I know some teenagers who attend classical music concerts regularly, but they are a minority. Although I'm a musician and play in an orchestra, I'm not a big fan of classical music. I enjoy many styles of music, but my computer shows that my classical music listening is probably similar to that 3% figure. So, why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music, with its many mood changes, are challenging for us. We prefer fast-paced activities and music. Additionally, we have difficulty focusing for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical music pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music requires time and attention. The subject matter of pop music also appeals more to teenagers than classical music with no lyrics. Classical music is powerful, but it doesn't deal with the issues that concern teenagers. The way we listen to music has changed. In the past, families would make music together at home, and playing an instrument was valued. The only other opportunity to hear music was at a concert. Now, we can find any music we want online, and classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you went to a shop with classical music playing in the background? My teacher claims that classical concert audiences have increased recently. Maybe, but I bet few of those new audience members are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in different locations, but the crowd is usually older. I don't know why people are more attracted to classical concerts in middle age, but I do know that if your parents love something, you're less likely to be interested in it. Some people blame schools for the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers, but there are students who enjoy playing classical music in their school orchestra. They practice early and stay late to rehearse. Classical music appeals to them when they perform, but it's not their preferred choice. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, it's usually pop music.

Mrs. Wyndham looked around and saw that the school was a bit confusing, with buildings hidden among the trees. She pointed out different parts of the school to Bonnie, including the science block, gymnasium, and riding centre. Bonnie was interested in the riding centre.

Bonnie's mother took her to the headmaster's study, and Bonnie sat outside the door while her mother talked to the headmaster. Bonnie was not happy to be there and decided to take matters into her own hands. She left the building and walked to the riding centre.

When she arrived, she saw that the horses were well taken care of and decided to take a closer look. She treated the horses with respect and admiration. Bonnie liked horses and knew how to care for them. She walked along the stalls, looking at each horse and judging its quality. She stopped in front of a brown horse with a touch of white and was impressed. 'You're the best horse here,' she said. The horse's name was Maverick.

Bonnie felt a connection with Maverick and decided to ride him. She found a saddle and bridle and put them on Maverick's back. She forgot about her mother and the headmaster and felt like a queen on the horse. She remembered her nickname 'Queen Bee' and laughed.

I jumped out of bed, pulled back the curtain, and looked down at the river bend. A new crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sunlight. I shielded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted. My back still ached from lifting them into place. All last week, I had worked with most of the town's adult population for long hours, showing that I was capable of doing the job. My grandfather didn't seem to care. I kept my hand on the curtain and looked along the half-mile stretch of steaming black water from the factory in Milltown. On either side, there were fragile ice shelves, followed by solid ice downstream. As I got dressed in my kayaking gear, I spotted a boy on the far side of the river. I didn't recognize him. I frowned. Unbelievably, he was trying to balance on an ice shelf near the warm water from the factory. I put on my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I checked my pocket for the lucky chain I keep there - a silver chain my famous grandfather brought back from an expedition in South America. It's more important to me than having a famous grandfather. I also have his diary from that trip, which I keep under my pillow and read before I go to sleep. I patted the chain and went to the kitchen. 'Good morning, Mom,' I said, taking a banana from the counter. 'You're up early for a Saturday. I'll cook brunch after your training session. Be careful, okay?' 'Thanks, Mom,' I replied. I headed downstairs, almost bumping into Grandpa as he came out of his bedroom. 'Can't you watch where you're going?' he shouted. 'Where are you going, anyway?' 'I'm going kayaking,' I said, as if it wasn't obvious. As if he didn't see me kayaking every morning. Grandpa can be difficult to deal with sometimes. 'What's the point of training if you didn't win the competition?' he said. For a moment, his words hurt. But I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went into the bathroom and slammed the door shut. Mom appeared with a sympathetic smile. 'Don't mind him. He's...not himself right now.' I finished the sentence for her. I tried not to say that he's always been like that. But I try to be understanding. When I was a child, he was my hero - from the time he showed me pictures of himself in National Geographic. Those old photos still hang on his bedroom wall, along with his dusty medals and trophies. But I don't go into his room anymore. I have my own collection of trophies and maybe someday I'll be in National Geographic too. But a part of me still wants to be close to him, this difficult old man. Mom smiled. 'At least, he's getting out of his bedroom more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even on cold days!' I smiled back at her. 'It'll be warmer in South America,' I said. 'If I can find sponsors for my expedition.' She laughed and went back to the kitchen. I ate my banana and went downstairs. I went to the backyard and hurried to the boathouse.'<|eot_id|>"

'Mum grabbed Jess's arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study, where a painting was propped against the wall. It was one of Grandpa's, but unlike anything he had done before. 'Do you know anything about this?' Mum asked. Jess shook her head. 'I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything.' Jess looked at the painting. There was a river that dominated the scene, but it didn't look like a real river. It was a fantasy river. The picture was strange and beautiful in a weird way. The riverbank was almost invisible, and the eye was drawn to the pale waters. There were no animals, no birds, no people. It felt right that way. Jess was captivated, thinking about the coming of autumn after a long summer. Mum spoke again. 'It's got a name.' There was something in her voice that betrayed her enthusiasm. Jess knew why. Grandpa never gave his pictures names. He just painted them and left others to figure them out. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them aloud. 'River Boy.' The words seemed important, but she didn't know why. And there was a mystery. She looked at Mum. 'There's no boy.' 'Exactly. It's strange, isn't it - for him to be so specific. Maybe he'll add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it.' 'Mum, you should have known better.' 'I know, but I couldn't resist. It's such an unusual picture, especially with a name. I suppose you can guess the response.' Jess didn't need to guess. She knew what Grandpa would say. 'He told you that it's not up to the artist to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and its own language, like a poem. We either understand it or we don't. And he said painting is hard work, so artists shouldn't waste time explaining their pictures to everyone who comes along.' Mum interrupted her, laughing. 'Anyway, I was hoping you might know something about this painting, since you seem to be his muse.' 'Muse?' 'Someone who inspires an artist.' Jess knew what the word meant. Grandpa used it when she watched him paint, but he never suggested she was his muse. 'He doesn't need me to inspire him,' she said. 'He's been painting all his life.''

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to damage my bedroom carpet. I didn't trip or anything, but I did have my dad's Stanley knife in my hand. I was trying to fit a corner cabinet into a corner, but it didn't fit because my room is shaped like a wedge of cheese. I have a small bedroom under the roof, and it only has two corners. My sister has a bigger room, and when she goes to university, my brother will have her room, and I'll get his. But that's not for a while, so I'm stuck in my small room for now. I like it, though - it's cozy and has a sloping roof and a window at floor level. The problem is, there aren't enough corners for my furniture. I tried to fit the cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was too tall. Then I thought, why not cut a hole in the carpet?

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live in the walls and floors of a house. They take things from the normal-sized people to survive. When I directed a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it would be challenging. People who love the book have strong ideas about how it should be done. I used the original drawings from the book to guide my work. The author wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not from a human perspective, which made filming more complex. The most important thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so we had to film them from a distance ten times greater than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from a low angle. We developed a special technique to get the shadows right when combining the tiny Borrowers with the background. One of the biggest challenges was building the set for the Borrowers' home under the floorboards. We built it with giant objects to make the actors look small. The actors had to carry big props, which was funny. We even had to stop filming sometimes because everyone was laughing too much. In one scene, the Borrowers get swept away by a drain. The actors had to go through a tunnel with water and said it was very scary. I was careful with the costumes, making them look like doll clothes. The actors had trouble moving around in them. The weather was hot during filming, and the actors didn't thank me for my attention to detail. We filmed most scenes with the actors separated from their surroundings, in front of a blue screen. I drew pictures of each scene to help the actors understand what to do. It was a lot of work, but the series turned out well and captured the magic of the books.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Removed some complex vocabulary and phrases
* Simplified sentence structures and sentence length

My mom drops me off at Palm Grove High School, my new school. She looks around nervously, worried about paparazzi. I reassure her everything will be fine. She kisses me and leaves, and I'm on my own with a new school and new classmates. I wanted to get away from my old life on tour with my band and start fresh. I'm excited to meet normal kids, not just people who know my dad, a famous musician. I walk into the school office and ask for my schedule. The secretary is unfriendly, but I manage to get my schedule. My first class is English Literature, which I love. I'm a bit late, but I find the classroom and take a seat next to a girl named Becca. She smiles and we chat. The teacher, Ms. Smigla, introduces herself and gives us our course outlines. We have some time to talk, and Becca asks me why I moved here. I tell her my dad had to relocate for work, which is true, but not the whole truth. I'm just trying to fit in and keep my celebrity life a secret for now.

I made minimal changes to the original text to make it more accessible to a level C1 learner, while still maintaining the original meaning and content. I:

* Simplified some of the sentence structures and vocabulary to make them more accessible to a level C1 learner.

* Changed some of the more complex sentences to shorter, simpler ones.
* Removed some of the more descriptive language and focused on the main events and ideas in the passage.

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a learner of English at the C1 level:

The average American teenager is expected to excel in many areas. They are expected to be good students, have a part-time job, volunteer, and participate in extracurricular activities. This is a heavy burden, and many teenagers feel overwhelmed. They have a lot of homework, tests, and responsibilities at home, on top of trying to maintain a social life. Despite these pressures, some people still hold negative stereotypes of teenagers, portraying them as lazy, disrespectful, and self-absorbed.

However, not all teenagers fit this stereotype. Many are responsible and hardworking, and they use their cellphones to stay organized and manage their time effectively. They use their phones to access information, complete homework, and communicate with others. In fact, many students start their day early and end it late, with little time for leisure activities.

The US National Sleep Foundation found that many teenagers do not get enough sleep, with 20% getting the recommended nine hours a night. As a result, some teens fall asleep in school due to sleep deprivation. Despite their busy schedules, many teenagers still find time to volunteer and make a positive impact in their communities.

Some teenagers, like Lindamarie Olsen, disagree with the stereotype that they are selfish and only focused on their own interests. Olsen spends most of her free time volunteering and making a difference in her community. She believes that the stereotype of teenagers is unfair and that they are capable of achieving great things.

In 20 years, the stereotype of teenagers may change, but one thing is certain: they will continue to surprise and inspire us.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a C1 level learner:

The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers from Bishop, a town surrounded by wilderness in the US. Over the past few years, they have launched over 50 balloons into space, around 35 km above the Earth's surface. This project combines astronomy and adventure. I joined them one weekend in the spring to watch them release a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. These occur when a rock or piece of metal enters the Earth's atmosphere, producing a trail of light.

The team prepares the balloon by attaching a camera, an altitude-measuring instrument, and a thermometer to a lunch box. They also add two GPS trackers to help them locate the balloon later. A gas tank, donated by a local enthusiast, is used to inflate the balloon, which grows to the size of a small car.

As the balloon lifts off, the team tracks its path with flashlights, illuminating the moonless sky. They feel a sense of collective wonder as the balloon disappears into the night. After the launch, some students stay to watch shooting stars, lying on blankets on the mountainside and gazing at the incredibly clear sky.

The balloon eventually pops, and a parachute helps the equipment inside the lunch box land safely back on Earth. The students use the GPS trackers to find it the next day. Recovering the lunch box is a challenge, as it often lands in remote areas. The team has only lost two lunch boxes in 53 launches, and the leader believes that part of the appeal is becoming familiar with the wilderness.

On this occasion, the lunch box landed 84 km west of Bishop, and it took the recovery team 11 hours to find it in a canyon, high on a flat rock, near a waterfall. Although the camera didn't record any shooting stars, it was still an exciting adventure, and the team could discuss the effects of atmospheric waves and mountain ridges.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at level C1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages):

Chloe Morgan didn't always find science interesting, especially not Palaeontology. However, everything changed when she was 15. Her younger brother was fascinated by dinosaurs, and she helped him with a science project. When she read an article about recent discoveries in the field, she was amazed and knew she wanted to pursue it.

Chloe remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was already well-known despite being young. She was nervous at first, but he was friendly and willing to listen to her questions.

I ask her about the portrayal of palaeontologists in movies and TV shows. She thinks that films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but they often stereotype palaeontologists as eccentric geniuses or awkward scientists. In reality, her job is varied and involves digging up dinosaur bones, analyzing fossils, and writing scientific papers. She also spends time explaining scientific findings to the public.

Chloe believes that communicating scientific information to the public is important, especially to young people. She thinks that talking about dinosaurs can help children develop an interest in science and appreciate its many branches.

Recently, Chloe worked on a TV documentary called Walking with Dinosaurs. She was happy to provide advice to the makers of the programme, which featured realistic dinosaurs that are different from those in movies like Jurassic Park. Chloe thinks that dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they represent the unknown and the thrill of discovery. Palaeontology is a way for us to travel back in time and explore the past.

Here is the simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at level C1 (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages):

When you're on a car trip with your family, you probably know you're not at your destination yet, even if you keep asking 'Are we there yet?' But the truth is, when you finally arrive, it's not really 'there' anymore - it's 'here'. So, if you're not there yet, you should be asking 'Are we here yet?' Parents are often tired of answering this question, especially on long car trips. They have to deal with demanding kids, like me and my brother Tim. We would fight over the seat and try to get attention. Our parents would try to calm us down, but sometimes we would get upset again. My dad developed a clever way to deal with our questions. He would say, 'We're there!' and then, when we pointed out that we were still on the highway, he would say, 'Oh, maybe we're not there yet.' This would keep us quiet for a while. You know you're finally 'there' when you see the grown-ups get out of the car and go away from the kids who were bothering them for hours. So, remember: if the parents are still near, the answer is 'no, you're not there yet.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Removed some idiomatic expressions and colloquial language (e.g., ""for the record"", ""on-the-road concierge"", ""steeped in history"")
* Simplified some sentence structures and vocabulary (e.g., combined some sentences, removed complex clauses)
* Removed some humorous and ironic language (e.g., ""I'm pretty sure there's no one who wishes they were 'there' yet more than the mums and dads..."")
* Retained the main ideas and storyline, but removed some of the details and anecdotes that were not essential to the message.

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of English at the C1 level:

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford where people can enjoy a cup of coffee, cake, and play board games. The owners want people to have a great experience and come back. Zuzi explains why they chose to turn their love of board games into a business: 'People are always busy with their phones and gadgets. We want to bring people together in a way that's not just about screens. It's natural for people to be together and communicate with each other.'

The games they play in the café are called 'Eurogames'. They are known for their gentle themes, such as farming and building landscapes. The first game of this type was 'The Settlers of Catan', created by a German designer. Players work together to build settlements on an island and trade resources, making it a fun and engaging experience for everyone.

Another popular game is 'Pandemic', where players work together to solve global problems. The game's designer, Matt Leacock, was inspired by a game called 'Lord of the Rings'. He wanted to create a game that would be fun and exciting, but also make everyone feel good at the end, whether they won or lost.

The growth of the video game industry has actually helped the success of modern board games. Many people who play video games on their phones or consoles are now open to playing board games too. As a result, tabletop gaming has become more popular, and people are looking for ways to play games with others in person.

In our increasingly online world, games have become something to be shared and enjoyed with others in the real world. This trend is likely to continue, as seen in John and Zuzi's busy and popular café.

To make the text more suitable for a learner of English at the C1 level, I will simplify the language while maintaining the factual content. Here is the revised text:

Tony Connor is a unique kind of celebrity. He's famous online for performing incredible stunts on his bike, but most people don't know who he is unless they're interested in watching videos of people doing daring bike tricks. Tony is a street trials cyclist, which means he jumps from one difficult location to another, often from a roof, a wall, or a rocky ledge. These stunts are recorded and shared online.

When I met Tony, we went to a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids knew who he was, and we had to stop a few times while older people came to congratulate him, calling him a 'legend'. After seeing him perform some of his skills, I have to agree with them. Despite being a bit skeptical at first, I was impressed by his bravery, creativity, and willingness to take risks.

Before each stunt, Tony explains what he's trying to do, and I often wonder if he'll actually succeed. However, when I praise him after the stunt, he seems unimpressed and a bit downbeat. Despite being famous, Tony is actually quite reluctant to be in the public eye. 'I find the social side of it difficult,' he says. 'I understand the value of connecting with fans, but I'd rather do things than talk about them.'

This attitude is ironic, given that his online presence is what made him famous. 'This technology gives people like me the opportunity to make a living,' he reflects. 'Sometimes I feel like everyone is staring at their phone or screen, and part of me doesn't agree with that.'

However, Tony isn't complaining. He makes a good living from the videos he creates, which would have remained a hobby for someone else. I've learned from years of interviewing top athletes that two key factors turn an enthusiastic child into an elite competitor: energy and the ability to bounce back from disappointment. These qualities are more important than talent, and they help you keep going even when things don't go as planned.

In the park, Tony fell a few times when facing obstacles that were unfamiliar to him. He just got up and kept trying until he mastered the trick. Tony isn't always seen as a hero. Some people think he's reckless and takes unnecessary risks. He responds, 'The people making these accusations might be genuinely concerned, but they're not well-informed. They don't understand the technical aspects of what I do or the expert advice I get to minimize the risks.'

In fact, Tony is far from reckless. 'People are different,' he says. 'Some never get scared and shouldn't be doing these kinds of sports; it's wise to be aware of the dangers. The rest of us can be divided into those who can't overcome fear and those who can. I'm in the group that feels fear but finds a way past it. I'm not addicted to risk and spend hours planning and preparing. Sometimes I have to ride around for a while to get myself in the right mindset before attempting a new stunt.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Simplified vocabulary: replaced words like ""sceptical"" with ""a bit skeptical"", ""indifferent"" with ""unimpressed and a bit downbeat"", and ""minimised"" with ""minimize"".
* Reduced complex sentence structures: broke down long sentences into shorter ones to make them easier to follow.
* Removed idiomatic expressions: replaced expressions like ""part of me doesn't go along with that"" with a more literal translation.
* Simplified technical terms: explained technical terms like ""street trials cyclist"" and ""BMX park"" to make them more accessible to non-experts.

Television presenter Helen Skelton has completed many challenging tasks for charity, including running a marathon in the desert and traveling down the Amazon River in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a thin metal wire, 66 meters above the ground, between the two towers of an empty power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to a wire above. To help her balance and not fall, she carried a heavy stick. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker. Although she had some circus skills, she found that high-wire walking was very different. ""The training was a shock,"" Helen said. ""I didn't realize how strong I'd need to be. Every day started with a run up a steep hill, followed by exercises and then more practice on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could keep going. Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt badly. But it was essential to stay positive: if I was nervous and started shaking, the wire would too!""

On the day of the challenge, it was windy, but Helen controlled herself by taking deep breaths as she moved step by step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ""That was the scariest thing I've done,"" Helen admitted afterwards. ""I'm glad it's over!"" Despite the experience, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, kiting, and biking.

Changes made:

* Simplified vocabulary: ""dangerous challenges"" -> ""challenging tasks"", ""tiny boat"" -> ""small boat"", ""long thin piece of metal"" -> ""thin metal wire"", ""eight kilograms"" -> ""heavy stick""
* Simplified sentence structures: combined some sentences, removed complex phrases like ""Every time I fell on the wire it hurt badly"" -> ""Every time I fell on the wire, it hurt badly""

In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, a type of bicycle with a large front wheel and a smaller rear wheel. Before this trip, Jeff had already written a book about his experiences traveling across Canada in a 50-year-old car. He was also passionate about motor sports and worked as an engineer building racing car engines. To save money, Jeff used to ride an old bicycle to work and even took it on a holiday to Amsterdam. This trip inspired him to see the world on a bike.

Jeff didn't want a regular touring bike, so he decided to build his own. He chose a penny farthing because it was the most unusual type of bicycle he could think of. After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 due to a knee injury, Jeff finally set out on his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The highlight of his trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. Although he met cyclists who could ride up steep hills, which he couldn't do, Jeff never regretted his choice of penny farthing. People were amazed by it wherever he went, and the farther he traveled from home, the more amazed they were.

Jeff's worst experience was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream and contracted a serious fever. He spent ten days in a hostel bed without medicine, unable to afford hospital bills or a return ticket home. Despite this, Jeff would still set off on another journey on his penny farthing if he could afford it.

We've just started using a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to observe the ducks at night. We're concerned about the black duck population because their numbers have declined significantly, and we're unsure if there's enough food available for them on the east coast. While there's a lot of information about their daytime activities, we know very little about their nocturnal behavior. With this new scope, we'll be able to capture clear images even on moonless nights and make more informed decisions about conservation efforts. It's a challenging project, as we're working in a team of four, each of us putting in six hours a day. We've visited various locations, and I've had to take a boat to some sites to record observations. The weather hasn't been ideal, with some nights being mild and others wet. I've had to rely on coffee to stay awake. We've only missed one working day due to heavy snow, but it's been worth it.

Have you ever wondered what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson, from Circus Experience, teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it covers many skills, including juggling, trapeze, and even fire-throwing. On the one-year course, students gradually take on more challenging activities, and parents are invited to some classes to see their progress.

Sophia explains that to succeed in the circus, performers need to keep their performances fresh and exciting. They must also keep practicing and be willing to learn from others. Being physically fit is crucial, as circus artists train daily to stay strong. The best performers are those who are dedicated, creative, and always looking to improve.

Some people might think that circus performers are prone to injuries or only work for a short time each year. However, Sophia says that the biggest challenge is planning for the future. As performers get older, they need to consider alternative options. The course also covers business planning, and many previous students have gone on to set up their own businesses around the world. Sophia warns that it's not a job for the sake of making money, as the work is often irregular and competitive. But she emphasizes that it's a lot of fun.

Vicky Harmiston had a childhood where she and her brother Jamie were given the freedom to choose their own activities. Vicky was a sporty child and chose to participate in various sports. She was a talented swimmer, and her swimming coach thought she had the potential to become a champion. However, the swimming club was far from her home, making it difficult for her to balance her training with her schoolwork. When she and Jamie were teenagers, Jamie bought a track racing bike and started competing. Vicky was impressed by his passion and decided to try cycling herself.

The track was close to her school, making it easy for her to attend training sessions after school. Vicky went on to have a successful career in track cycling, winning several competitions. At the age of 28, she retired from competitive cycling. Vicky told me that she had loved winning competitions, but eventually, the excitement wore off, and she felt it was time to move on. Luckily, she found a new career. She started working for a charity called CycleZone, which helps young people who have never enjoyed sports. The charity's goal is to teach them to ride a bike and believe in themselves. Vicky believes that the support of famous people, like celebrities, can be beneficial for charities. She thinks that if they can help, they should, despite some people's concerns that their involvement might overshadow the charity's real work.

Ana Ronson, a singer-songwriter, grew up in Ireland. Although her parents weren't musicians, music was always present in her home. Her grandfather taught her and her brother how to play the guitar. Ana's first experience singing in front of an audience was at school, but she was very nervous and had to be led off the stage. Her teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to build her confidence. After joining the club, she performed with 50 other students at an end-of-term concert. A year later, her brother asked her to write a song for his band, and she wrote her first song, 'Falling Stars', in just three days. She enjoyed the experience so much that she enrolled in a songwriting course. Despite being the youngest student, she already had a good understanding of music. However, the teacher didn't take her ideas seriously, which made her feel frustrated. She wrote a song called 'Something to Say' about this experience. She posted it online and it became very popular. People left comments saying they loved the song and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened. Joss Alton, the owner of Isotope Music, flew from the other side of Ireland to ask her to join his company. At first, Ana was hesitant, but Joss reassured her that she would have creative freedom. She eventually performed at a concert in Dublin arranged by Isotope, which was a huge success. Ana's songs often focus on personal experiences, especially when life is challenging. One of her favorite songs is 'Decision', which is about her brother's decision to stop singing and how it affected him. Ana hopes that her fans will connect with her songs and find them meaningful.

Last year, I went on an incredible journey with my brother Harry. We took a guided boat tour along the west coast of Canada. Harry is a journalist and wanted to write articles about the trip. He's also passionate about boats. I've always been fascinated by the area since I saw it on TV as a child. Our great-grandparents used to live there before moving to Europe, so I was excited to visit. I kept asking Harry if I could join him, and eventually, he agreed.

Before we left, there were storms in the area, but the forecast was good for the time we would be there. I was busy with work, so I didn't have much time to think about the trip details. Harry assured me he had everything under control, so I stopped worrying.

When we arrived in Canada, we joined the group and set off in small boats. Our guide told us that few people lived along that coast, and indeed, we only saw dolphins and birds on that first morning. We could see some islands in the distance, but the fog made it hard to see far, so I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches, which were full of colorful fish I didn't recognize. It was great to stop worrying about time and just enjoy the moment. We had meals together over campfires, and even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life. When it was time to leave, I was sad to go back to normal life, but I knew I'd miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also looking forward to sharing our adventures with everyone back home.

'My father was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. I used to go to many of his games when I was a kid. You might think that watching all those matches would make me a big basketball fan, but actually, it had the opposite effect. I loved telling my friends how great my dad was, especially when he won, but I would often take a book with me to read instead of watching. When I started secondary school, I was already quite tall, at 2 metres. My sports teacher asked if I wanted to join the basketball team. At first, I wasn't sure, but he had more faith in me than I did. It took me a while to agree, but eventually, I started playing against another school's team. It was a bit nerve-wracking, but it was okay in the end. For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to the USA at the age of 15. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players, and it was amazing to work with him. Although I didn't enjoy being away from my parents at first, I got used to it. My English improved quickly, too. I turned professional at 18, three years after moving to the USA. I had been taller than most players in the professional league since I was 15, but I was too light for my height, so I had to work on that first. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them and I've never regretted it.'

Seven years ago, I was studying Tourism at college, but I needed a part-time job to help pay my tuition fees. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my hometown, Chicago. This involved showing visitors around the city, and I was surprised to find that I really enjoyed it. I got to see my city in a new light, and every tour was a unique experience. After finishing my studies, I decided to make tour guiding my full-time job. However, I soon realized that becoming a licensed guide required a lot more knowledge than I had initially thought. All Chicago guides must be able to answer hundreds of questions about the city, covering topics such as architecture, history, and public transportation. After several challenging but interesting months, I obtained my tour guide qualification and became an independent guide.

As a tour guide, my job is not just about knowing historical facts or keeping track of the group. I also need to be entertaining, tell engaging stories, and be able to adapt to unexpected situations, such as a place being closed or a route change. My goal is to ensure that visitors have a great time and are satisfied with their tour. If they're not, they might leave a negative review online, which could harm my business. That's why I focus on making my tours enjoyable and stress-free. My positive reviews and recommendations from satisfied customers help attract more visitors to Chicago.

""My name is Ella and I'm 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand with my sister Josie. Although she's five years younger than me, we get along well. We volunteered at an elephant sanctuary, a place that takes care of sick and rescued elephants. To be honest, I was a bit worried that we wouldn't fit in with the other volunteers because they were much older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. However, we quickly realized that there was no need to worry. Our main task at the sanctuary was to collect food for the elephants. They eat huge amounts of grass and banana plants, so it took most of the day. Josie found it challenging, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meal made it worthwhile for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants! The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. Under the light of the moon, we would lead the elephants to their forest home where they spent the night. All the volunteers stayed in the same house, and Josie and I shared a bedroom. We didn't have much space, but that was our choice because Josie didn't want to be alone. The weather was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and didn't include meat, which neither of us likes. After dinner, we would spend the evenings talking and playing games with the other volunteers and staff. Now that we're back in the UK, Josie doesn't often talk about Thailand. But if anyone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. However, I think she might be a bit disappointed that she didn't make the most of her time there because she missed her friends. But when she looks back, she can see how lucky she was to have gone. Maybe she'll go back one day – I definitely will!""

I've even decorated a castle for a wedding! My day starts at 4 a.m. when I visit the flower market to buy fresh flowers. It's early, but I enjoy the experience. The market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. Choosing the right flowers can be challenging, as there are so many options. I have to consider what I like and what my customers want. Sometimes, we can't find the exact flowers customers are looking for, as they may not be in season. Negotiating prices with the flower sellers can be difficult, but it's part of the job. Flowers are expensive, so I need to get the best price possible. Back at the shop, we arrange the flowers in vases and create bouquets. I enjoy thinking about how to create the most beautiful arrangement for a customer's budget. Some customers are surprised by the cost, and I sometimes need to suggest alternative options.

My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films. I wanted to experience discussing a film with others after watching it, so I started a film club with two friends. We decided not to rent a cinema and instead show our films in different locations around the city each month. For example, we showed a film set in Antarctica in an old factory, which added to the atmosphere. Some places we use are free, as the owners make money from selling snacks during the film. We're happy to break even, not make a profit. Each time we show a film, it gets a bit easier for us, especially since we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we've sold online, so no more worries about empty seats. After the film, people of all ages come together to share their thoughts, which is wonderful. Our website has been helpful, and we're in touch with other film clubs across the country. We've visited other clubs to see how they do things, but it's always good to get back to our own club. We've also started a blog because most people look for film information online now. We've put up posters in cafes, but word of mouth is the most successful way to spread the word – people recommending us to their friends. We also organize special activities with each film, like a movie quiz last month, which everyone enjoyed.

'Taking photographs was always my favorite activity as a child. When I turned 15, I decided to take my hobby to the next level. I started a personal project: taking one photograph every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea. I put my photos on a website for young photographers and was surprised to find that others liked my style. I enjoyed taking photos of various subjects, but someone suggested that having a common theme would make my project better. I decided to focus on nature scenes, especially birds and the sky. I took many black and white photos, which was different from what most other young photographers were doing. Sometimes I doubted my project, but I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style. My art teacher at school told me about a national photography competition for young people. I entered some photos and was thrilled when I won first prize. It was the first time I realized that my photography might be good enough to make a career out of it. Today, I have my own photography studio and I'm glad I chose this path.'

My leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organize activities at a local children's club for two hours a week. I was initially hesitant because I had a difficult experience at the same club when I was eight. However, I decided to take on the challenge to earn my first certificate. Surprisingly, I found that I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to spend more time at the club. The experience meant more to me than just getting the certificate. After completing the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club, as I had built strong relationships with the children. Now, I spend about four hours a week at the club and always look forward to it.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at the C1 level:

I was born in Denver, USA and started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort, about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try it. At first, I didn't think about asking him if I could try snowboarding, but he was already passionate about it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I managed just fine. After that experience, I quickly developed a passion for the sport and improved my skills. By the time I was ten, I was already competing.

Not everyone who enters competitions stays enthusiastic about snowboarding, but my love for it has only grown stronger as I've gotten older. I enjoy the freedom of not having a fixed plan and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to achieve a perfect score at a local competition. I wasn't sure I'd attempt the jumps that got me that score until I started doing them. This achievement boosted my confidence in my abilities.

During the summer, I focus on training and my studies since there's no snow. Although I train daily, I don't have to follow a strict diet like I do in the winter. I also get to spend a lot of time with my friends, which is great. It's the best way to deal with not being able to do what I love so much and what I'm really good at.

I have to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is a huge part of my life now, but I also think it's important to have something else I can do, just in case I don't become a professional snowboarder or get injured. I'm considering becoming a doctor, but I'm not sure if my active lifestyle will allow me to pursue a college degree. It's hard to imagine myself getting tired of the sport, but I can't keep snowboarding forever.

One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it if I paid for it myself, so I started working part-time to save up. This taught me a valuable lesson, and I'm grateful to my parents for making me do it.

I worked at a café every Saturday, but I didn't enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own business instead. I had seen my mum making jewelry, so I asked if I could try it too. I was surprised to find it was easier than I thought, and my friends and family were impressed with what I made. They bought my jewelry, but I wasn't convinced it was good enough for the public. To test it, my mum and I rented a market stall. We sold a lot of jewelry to tourists, and soon we were getting orders from all over the country. People thought we were a big company, but we were just two people running a small stall! This was when I knew it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website.

Janine Stuart wrote a novel called Being Amelia when she was just 13 years old. The book became a bestseller. Janine's life inspired parts of the story. In an interview, she said that because her family moved around a lot when she was young, she learned to make new friends easily. This experience helped her write about the main character, Amelia, who starts at a new school. The book also focuses on Amelia's family life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Since Janine is an only child, she had to use her imagination to describe her brother.

Janine started writing the book one summer when she was feeling bored at home. Her mother had always wanted to be a writer, and her teachers encouraged her to write. After winning a short story competition the previous year, Janine felt confident to send her novel to a publishing company. The publishers loved it, and a year later, the book was on sale in bookstores.

A book review praised Being Amelia, saying that despite the happy-looking cover, the characters face some tough challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer noted that Janine, who is still young, is a talented writer, even better than some best-selling authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous author. At first, she was shy when people recognized her in the street, but now it's okay. She advises young writers to find what works for them, and for her, spending time with friends always gives her ideas for her writing.

At first, we were all hesitant about the move, especially since we would be leaving our cozy home and school behind. However, we soon adjusted to island life.

In the winter, we mostly see the other families who live on the island, and there aren't many teenagers like me. The adults are very supportive and help with repairs on the island, which can be physically demanding. The biggest change for me was having to travel by boat to school every day. I enjoy the ferry rides, especially on stormy days when the waves are huge. However, I sometimes worry about missing the bus to the harbor after school and the last ferry home. When my friends come to visit, I always remind them to hurry up! The views on the ferry are amazing, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Sometimes, the fog is so thick that you can't see anything, but then the sun comes out again and it's still incredible. We do have bad storms, and I sometimes worry about the castle's safety.

I live in a beautiful countryside in Scotland, surrounded by nature. I've always loved animals and the outdoors, so I started birdwatching six years ago. My family and I went to the mountains in northern Scotland, where we saw many birds in their natural habitat. My parents taught me how to identify different species and find the best places to spot them. It was an amazing experience, and after that, I joined a local birdwatching club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I've almost achieved it. On family holidays abroad, I've had the chance to see birds from other countries, too. We always look for places where there are group birdwatching activities, so I can add new birds to my list. I recently went to Egypt and South America, but I didn't see my 200th species. I posted a video about my challenge online, and many teenagers thought it was a fascinating hobby. My teachers asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school, which was a bit nerve-wracking, but it went well. I think it's great to live in the countryside, as there are many birds to see, even in urban areas with green spaces. I also think that birdwatching clubs should encourage more young people to join.

In recent years, there has been a growing trend in higher education to encourage students to get involved in research from the early stages of their studies. This is because research is not just for renowned scholars or experts in specific fields, but a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in your future career, as they help you think critically and approach problems in a systematic way. As a student, you contribute to the creation of knowledge by asking questions, analyzing information, and making connections between ideas.

Research involves asking questions like ""Why?"", ""How?"", ""What if?"", and ""How does it work?"" These questions help you think critically about the information you receive and make sense of it. There are different types of research, ranging from complex, groundbreaking studies to everyday inquiries that involve careful planning and analysis.

You have likely been conducting research in some form since you started studying or working. You may have asked questions, gathered information, and analyzed data to answer those questions. Even in your daily life, you use research skills when planning a trip, fixing something, or making a decision.

In higher education, you are expected to develop your research skills by questioning established knowledge, evaluating information, and constructing your own responses. This may seem daunting, but it is an essential part of the learning process. Critical thinking is crucial in research, and you need to be able to engage with the information you receive, think critically, and test its validity.

Cities have long been hubs of intellectual activity, from the 18th-century coffeehouses of London to the modern-day cafes of Paris. However, city life is not without its challenges. The same cafes that sparked lively discussions also contributed to the spread of diseases like cholera. Pablo Picasso, for example, eventually left the city for a more peaceful life in the countryside.

Despite the many benefits of city living, such as creativity and innovation, urban environments can be overwhelming and unnatural. Research has shown that city life can even dull our thinking and reduce our cognitive abilities. One reason for this is the lack of natural environments, which are essential for our mental well-being.

Studies have found that even brief glimpses of nature, such as seeing trees from a hospital window, can improve brain function and boost mental performance. This is because nature provides a mental break from the stresses of urban life.

As more people move to cities, it's essential to understand the impact of urban environments on our mental and physical health. Cities are crowded and overwhelming, with many stimuli competing for our attention. This can be exhausting, as our brains need to constantly redirect our attention to avoid distractions.

In contrast, natural environments require less mental effort, allowing our brains to relax and recharge. This concept is known as attention restoration theory, which suggests that immersion in nature can have a restorative effect on our minds.

Philosophers and landscape architects have long recognized the importance of integrating nature into urban design. Parks and green spaces can provide a respite from the stresses of city life, improving our mental well-being and cognitive function.

Despite the challenges of city living, research has also shown that urban environments can foster creativity and innovation. The concentration of people and social interactions in cities can lead to new ideas and breakthroughs.

The key is to find a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of city living. While we may crave the excitement and stimulation of city life, we also need to prioritize our mental and physical well-being.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a learner of English at the C1 level:

'Where is the mind? This might seem like a strange question. After all, thinking happens inside our heads. But I think it's time to consider the idea that the mind extends beyond our skin and skull. There is plenty of evidence from the past to suggest that objects and materials play a crucial role in human thought and cognitive development. From ancient times to the present day, we have used objects, symbols, and tools to help us think and learn. This is why I propose that the mind is not just limited to the brain, but is also connected to the world around us.

Many people assume that the mind and brain are the same thing. This is because most of what we know about the mind has come from studying people in isolation, away from their everyday surroundings. However, this approach overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside of our heads. I'm not saying that the brain isn't important, but I do think it's time to consider the idea that our intelligence extends beyond our bodies.

To explore this idea, I've developed a theory called Material Engagement Theory (MET). This theory looks at how objects and materials become an extension of our bodies and minds. For example, when we use a tool or create something with our hands, we are incorporating those objects into our thinking. MET also examines how this process has changed over time and what it means for the way we think.

This approach gives us a new understanding of what the mind is and how it works. For instance, think of a blind person using a stick. Where does their sense of self begin? The connection between the stick and the person's body is a good example of how our minds and bodies are connected. It also shows that our minds are capable of adapting and changing as we incorporate new technologies and innovations into our lives.

My theory sees the human mind as an ongoing project, constantly evolving and adapting to new experiences and discoveries. Whatever form our ""stick"" might take – from ancient stone tools to modern technology – its primary function is to provide a pathway for us to explore and understand the world around us. This is why humans have always made things, and why those things have shaped our minds in return. I call this process metaplasticity – our minds are capable of changing and developing as we interact with the world around us. MET offers a new way of understanding how different materials and technologies have helped shape our minds and our understanding of ourselves.'

Photography has had a significant impact on society, especially in the United States. It quickly became an integral part of American culture, influencing various aspects of life, from science and industry to art and entertainment. Historians consider photography to be the country's most significant contribution to the visual arts.

Photography was appealing because it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology in the United States. It also brought the world into people's homes, making it possible to capture and share moments and experiences. The camera became a popular tool for self-portraiture, allowing people to present themselves to the public. Additionally, photography was used to create a sense of family identity and to document important events.

The photograph's ability to capture reality made it a powerful medium for representation, and its aesthetic appeal was in line with the trend towards realism in American art. Every photograph is a message, drawing attention to something and saying, ""Look at this!"" The photograph's objectivity, as a record of what was in front of the camera, is unique. However, the photographer's perspective and point of view also influence the image.

Understanding a photograph requires considering its purpose, context, and the cultural framework in which it was created. The same image can have different meanings in different contexts. Photography has become an essential element in contemporary art, with many artists incorporating photographs into their work.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level C1 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR):

'William James, an American philosopher and psychologist, defined psychology as the'science of mental life'. This definition remains relevant today. We all have a mental life, and we have some idea what it means. However, psychology is a complex and somewhat elusive field. James believed that human psychology consists of basic elements: thoughts, feelings, and a physical world. Our knowledge is primarily personal and private, based on our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This makes it easy for us to make judgments about psychological matters using our own experiences as a reference point. We often behave like amateur psychologists when we offer opinions on complex psychological issues, such as whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways. However, problems arise when different people have different understandings. Formal psychology aims to provide methods for determining which explanations are most likely to be correct. Psychologists help us distinguish between subjective thoughts and facts, and between our preconceptions and what is scientifically true.

Psychology is about the mind or brain, but psychologists don't fully understand how the brain works. They study our behavior and use observations to develop hypotheses about what is happening inside us. The difficulty in studying psychology is that scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the workings of the mind are not directly observable. Psychologists have to infer what is going on by observing behavior. Studying psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle, where we evaluate and interpret clues. The clues must be derived from careful observation, accurate measurement, and logical arguments that can be scrutinized.

Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes it studies. Once these goals are achieved, it can help us understand our experience and apply the findings to people's lives. Psychological research has been useful in fields such as education, machine design, and emotional support. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, scientific investigation has only been possible for about 150 years. Early psychologists relied on introspection, but this has limitations. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on observations of phenomena rather than personal experiences.'

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of English at the C1 level (CEFR):

In a warehouse in Michigan, USA, there's a unique collection of failed products. It's often referred to as the Museum of Failed Products. The owner, Carol Sherry, sees each product as a story of failure for the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved. What's striking is that this museum is a profitable business. Many companies don't keep samples of their failed products, so it's surprising that this museum exists.

The museum's originator, Robert McMath, started collecting products in the 1960s, intending to create a reference library. However, he ended up with a collection of mostly unsuccessful products because most products fail. This might be due to a culture of optimism in marketing, where companies invest more money in products that aren't doing well to avoid admitting failure.

This culture is also prevalent in the self-help industry, where people are encouraged to focus on positive thinking. Some researchers believe that our brains are wired to be optimistic, but this can actually decrease motivation to achieve goals. In fact, a study found that people who were encouraged to think about their future successes actually performed worse than those who didn't.

Psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that our experiences of failure are influenced by our beliefs about ability. People who believe that ability is innate tend to be more devastated by failure, while those who believe that ability can be developed through effort and hard work view failure as an opportunity to learn and improve. Dweck argues that having an incremental theory of ability is a happier and more productive way to approach challenges.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of English at the C1 level:

Playing at home gives sports teams an advantage, but why is this the case? Many people assume it's obvious, but professional sports are changing fast, and what we used to take for granted is now being questioned. Two factors are challenging the traditional explanation of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to know what makes players perform at their best, and they have come up with many theories about the impact of home advantage. On the other hand, those who make money from sports want to know why home advantage still matters. If players are well paid, shouldn't they feel comfortable anywhere?

This leaves fans wondering if it would make a difference if a team like Manchester United played some of their home games in the Far East to attract more fans. British fans might think so, as they believe their team needs their passion and loyalty to succeed. However, it's human nature to think that a sequence of events is caused by the order in which we remember them, rather than the actual order. Fans tend to remember when they started cheering and a goal was scored, but forget the times when their noise didn't make a difference.

One common fan's-eye view that is supported by scientific evidence is that home fans direct a lot of their energy towards the referee. In a famous experiment, referees were shown a recording of a match with either the sound of the crowd or no sound. The referees who heard the crowd noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team than those who didn't. This matches what actually happens during matches.

Recent studies have looked at long-term trends in home advantage. They show that home advantage has decreased in most sports, but not as much as expected. For example, in the early years of the English Football League, home teams won 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. This might be due to better travel conditions for players, but none of these explanations fully explain the data.

One mystery is why home advantage varies between sports. Basketball is the sport where playing at home is most beneficial, followed by football. However, baseball is the sport where home advantage is least significant. One possible reason is that home advantage is more important in team sports, where players need to work together. In basketball, winning depends on the team working together, which boosts confidence and familiarity with the home court.

Another possibility is that home advantage is connected to a primal urge to defend one's territory. Research has shown that players' testosterone levels increase before home matches, which could be linked to this instinct. This sense of territoriality might be related to the idea of defending one's home turf, as seen in the recent Rugby World Cup.

As one referee put it, ""It's the law of the jungle out there.""<|eot_id|>"

Here is the rewritten text at a level suitable for a C1 learner:

'Gary Player, a famous golfer, once said, 'The more I practise, the luckier I get.' This phrase has been widely used by athletes and coaches. However, the phrase is often misunderstood. Player was being ironic, meaning that the more he practises, the better he gets. But the debate about whether talent is innate or acquired is ongoing. Some argue that it's a combination of both. 

Psychologist Anders Ericsson believes that with 10,000 hours of practice, anyone can become an expert in a particular field. This idea has been popularized in books like 'Outliers' and 'Talent Is Overrated'. However, some experts disagree. They argue that it's not just about practice, but also about innate ability. 

In his book, Epstein argues that most research focuses on exceptional individuals and tries to explain why they are successful. However, this approach doesn't provide a complete understanding of why some people have certain abilities and others don't. Epstein explores this question by looking at various examples from different fields and cultures. He visits places like Kenya, Sweden, and Alaska to understand what makes people excel. 

Epstein's research suggests that there is a complex interplay between innate ability and environmental factors. He argues that both 'hardware' (natural ability) and'software' (nurture) are important. He also examines cases where natural ability plays a significant role and discusses the issue of race and gender in athletic competition. He questions why we separate men and women in sports, suggesting that it's not just about practice hours.'

A recent report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel unhappy, lonely, and out of place. Jay Griffiths asks a simple question: why are today's children so unhappy? In her book, Kith, Griffiths suggests that the problem is that children are spending too much time indoors, staring at screens, and losing touch with nature. She argues that this is the root of the problem. This idea is supported by other discussions about childhood.

A follow-up study interviewed children to better understand their unhappiness. The study found that many children do not want more gadgets; they just want to spend more time outside. Many adults over 40 also talk about the freedom they had as children, playing in the woods, swimming in ponds, or making dens in old sheds. They think this was better and healthier than the protected life of today's children. However, they rarely consider that they are the ones who imposed this protected life on their own children, worrying about the risks.

Griffiths' book also discusses the relationship between fear of danger and consumerism. Parents' fear of danger leads them to keep their children at home, which benefits the toy and gadget industry. She also criticizes the trend of prescribing medication for restless children or requiring kids to wear goggles for playground games. While these regulations may not be widespread, Griffiths conveys her indignation and frustration effectively.

However, Griffiths' arguments are not without flaws. She sometimes idealizes childhood and does not consider counterarguments. She also makes a controversial comparison between the treatment of children and racism. The book's main theme is the importance of giving children autonomy, allowing them to explore and take risks. Griffiths believes that children need to experience some danger to learn how to manage risk. However, she does not provide a clear plan for achieving this. Additionally, not all children may want to follow the ""wild"" model that Griffiths admires. Some children may be naturally timid or prefer to stay indoors. The real problem may be forcing all children into the same space, whether by keeping them indoors or pushing them out.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of level C1 on the CEFR:

As a research bio-psychologist, I've studied how people learn and develop. I believe that most problems in life cannot be solved by simply memorizing answers or using complex formulas. Instead, they require creative thinking, judgment, and wisdom, which come from life experiences. Children learn these skills through play, which is essential for their development.

All mammals, including humans, play when they're young. The more complex the environment, the more they play. Children, who have the most to learn, play the most. Play is a natural way for adults and mammals to learn and develop.

The most important skills children need to learn are those that cannot be taught in school. These include creativity, social skills, and self-control. Creativity is crucial for success in the modern world, where we need people who can think critically and solve new problems. The ability to think creatively is linked to the ability to play.

Many adults, including geniuses like Albert Einstein, retain their childlike creativity and curiosity throughout their lives. Einstein believed that his innovative work was a form of ""combinatorial play"".

Unfortunately, modern schooling often stifles creativity and play. Schools focus on imposed curricula and standardized tests, which can lead to a lack of creativity and imagination. This can have serious consequences for children's development and future success.

Children are naturally social and need to play with others to develop social skills and learn how to cooperate and be fair. Play is voluntary, which means that children are free to stop playing if they want to. This freedom is what makes play so democratic and empowering.

In recent years, there has been a trend towards less play and more adult supervision in children's lives. This has been caused by a combination of factors, including parents' fears, the rise of experts warning about dangers, and the decline of cohesive neighborhoods. We need to reverse this trend and give children the freedom to play and explore, so they can grow into strong, confident adults.

'Many young people in their twenties are turning to social media to find work. They use platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn to connect with potential employers and get noticed. However, this increased access also means there's a higher risk of making mistakes. A recent incident on LinkedIn highlights this risk. A young job seeker contacted a senior marketing executive, hoping to get help finding a job. But the executive was not impressed and sent a harsh rejection message that went viral. The incident serves as a reminder that social media can be a double-edged sword for job seekers. On the one hand, it provides a platform to connect with others, but on the other hand, it requires careful handling to avoid making a negative impression.

For many young people, social media has been a part of their lives since they were teenagers. They used it to escape the watchful eyes of parents and teachers, to present a different image of themselves, and to connect with friends. However, this experience is not directly applicable to professional networking. When using social media for job hunting, young people need to be aware of the differences and adjust their approach.

One common mistake is to be too familiar or arrogant in communication. This can give the impression that young people are entitled, which can harm their chances of getting hired. To avoid this, it's essential to be clear about who you are, what you can offer, and to show respect for the recipient's time. By doing so, you can increase your chances of getting a positive response.

In conclusion, social media can be a valuable tool for finding work, but it requires careful handling. Young people need to be aware of the differences between social media use for personal and professional purposes and adjust their approach accordingly.'

Newspapers are in trouble. Their circulation has been declining since 2000, with many UK national dailies losing between a third and half of their readers. In the United States, the Pew Research Centre reports that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26% of citizens, compared to 45% in 2001. Some experts predict that the last printed newspaper will disappear within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. For example, theatre has endured despite the rise of newspapers, cinema, and television.

Newspapers were once a new medium, but it took centuries for them to become the dominant source of news. This was due to advances in technology, such as the steam press, railway, and telegraph, which made it possible to produce and distribute news quickly and efficiently. Additionally, people began to expect regular updates on current events, a concept that was foreign to medieval times.

Journalism as a profession is relatively new, and there was no need for regular news until the 19th century. Even then, there was no guarantee that people would want to stay informed on a daily basis. The rigidity of newspaper publication and format can be a burden, whereas online news allows readers to access information at their own pace and according to their interests.

The internet has changed the way we consume news, offering instant updates, corrections, and access to documents and events. However, online news providers often prioritize being the first to break a story over spreading understanding and enlightenment. This is a return to the medieval era, where news was exchanged in the marketplace or tavern, where truth was often mixed with rumour and misinformation.

Newspapers have never been excellent at explaining how the world works. Perhaps they will become extinct, or perhaps they will find a new way to guide us towards wisdom and understanding in this chaotic world.

'If humans were meant to live in the moon's light, we would be happy in the dark. However, we are diurnal creatures, adapted to living in the sun's light. This is deeply ingrained in our genes, even though we don't often think of ourselves as diurnal beings. But it's the only way to explain how we've altered the night. We've managed to make the night suitable for us by filling it with artificial light. This control is similar to damming a river. While it has benefits, it also has negative effects, known as light pollution. Light pollution is mainly caused by poor lighting design, which lets light shine upwards and outwards, rather than downwards where it's needed. This artificial light washes out the natural darkness, disrupting the natural light cycles and rhythms that many living things, including humans, have adapted to. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it affects various aspects of life, such as migration, reproduction, and feeding. In the past, the term ""light pollution"" wouldn't have made sense. Imagine walking towards London on a moonlit night in 1800, when it was the world's most populous city. Only a few houses were lit by gas, and there were no public gaslights. From a distance, you would have smelled London more than seen its faint glow. We've lit up the night as if it were an empty space, when in reality, it's home to many nocturnal species. Light is a powerful force for many species, attracting them to it. This is so strong that scientists talk about birds being ""captured"" by searchlights or gas flares, circling and circling until they drop. Migrating birds often collide with brightly lit tall buildings, and young birds on their first journey are more likely to suffer. Some birds sing at unusual hours when artificial light is present. It was thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, who need to see the night sky clearly. However, unlike astronomers, most of us don't need an unobstructed view of the night sky for our work, but we do need darkness. Denying ourselves darkness is futile, as it's essential for our biological well-being. Modifying our internal clock can lead to physical problems. The regular rhythm of waking and sleeping in our lives is a reflection of the regular rhythm of light on Earth. These rhythms are fundamental to our being, and disrupting them is like altering our center of gravity. Ultimately, humans are just as trapped by light pollution as frogs near a brightly lit highway. Living in our own artificial light, we've cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a way, light pollution makes us lose sight of our true place in the universe, forgetting the scale of our being, which is best measured against the vastness of a dark night with the Milky Way overhead.'<|eot_id|>"

The founder of a large company has announced that they will no longer track employees' paid holidays. This decision was inspired by a similar policy at an internet company. The founder claims that the idea came from an email from his daughter, but some people think it might have been a clever marketing stunt.

The idea of taking as much time off as you want, as long as it doesn't harm the business, might work for small companies with a few employees. However, for a large company with many employees and different departments, it's much more complicated. It's hard to know if an employee's absence will affect the business, especially if they work in a different department.

The founder of the company says that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they're sure it won't harm their work or their career. But is it possible to be that sure? Even if you prepare well for a holiday, there's always a lot of work to catch up on when you get back. This can lead to stress and guilt, which can negatively impact productivity.

Additionally, the pressure to take unlimited leave can lead to a culture of competition and gossip in the workplace. People might feel like they need to work late to impress their colleagues and get ahead, which can lead to a ""no holiday"" culture. Without a clear policy, people might feel unsure about taking time off and might not take the leave they need.

Modern technology has blurred the lines between work and leisure time, making it difficult to disconnect. The internet company that started this trend did so because they wanted to reconcile their flexible work policy with their traditional time-off policy. However, this new policy can lead to uncertainty and self-doubt among employees.

Employment laws exist to protect workers' well-being, including their right to a certain amount of paid annual leave. This is important for their mental and physical health. While the unlimited leave policy might seem appealing, it's unclear whether it's the best solution for everyone.

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it's like a painting in words. But this doesn't really help me, or them. So, I asked them to describe an object in two ways: one as a scientist would, and the other from the object's point of view. One student chose an oxygen mask, which is an unusual choice. This exercise helped us understand how poetry is unique.

When I was at school, I found poetry difficult to understand. I thought it was just a puzzle that got in the way of true understanding and feeling. After school, poetry became even less interesting to most people. Occasionally, a poem stands out because it's different from regular writing. It's like a puzzle that challenges you to read it, and sometimes you might feel disappointed or confused. But you still try to understand it.

What do we expect from poems? Don't we want to find deep feelings, beautiful images, and clever ideas? But if we need to cry, we watch a movie; if we need information or a critique, we read an article. Novels take us on a journey, paintings are beautiful, and music is amazing. But poems have one special quality: they can be ambiguous, just like everyday life. Online dictionaries define a poem as a form of literary art that uses language in a special way. But the word ""poem"" comes from the Greek word for ""thing made."" So, what kind of thing is a poem?

Poets sometimes compare poems to wild animals or machines, but these comparisons don't really work. The important thing is to think about what a poem is and how it makes us see the world in a new way. The way words and music combine can be very powerful, like a song that gets stuck in your head. A poem on a page can be very powerful, even though it's just words on paper. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting, but it's not like other types of writing. It's not meant to be a commodity; it's meant to be appreciated for its own sake.

However, she was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, I've enjoyed finding various brooches and coins, which have given me a sense of connection to the past. It's been 40 years since I found something as exciting as the gold ring. Recently, I went metal detecting on a rainy afternoon and found a metal wheel fragment. The detector beeped again, and I couldn't help but investigate. After digging, I uncovered a golden ball, which turned out to be a beautiful, intricately patterned loop. I was amazed, as I had seen something similar before - the Great Torc, a famous necklace from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. I took it home and couldn't stop staring at it. I eventually reported the find to the authorities and had it authenticated. The torc was sold to my local council and is now in the British Museum in London. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the landowner and me. However, the experience has been more than just a lucky find.

What would they think if they knew that my own travel plans include lots of free time for napping and relaxation? I believe that good sleep is one of the best things about traveling. When I visited the Yucatán coast in Mexico, I was surprised to find that I slept for more than 12 hours a day. It was amazing! The noise from the birds outside didn't bother me, and I felt more relaxed than I ever do at home. Travel sleep is different because we are not bothered by alarm clocks and responsibilities. My theory is that sleep is an extension of our travels, not a break from them. When we travel, we experience new things, like different cultures, music, and ways of moving around. It's when we sleep that we process all these new experiences. That's why travel sleep is often more intense. Sleep also changes depending on where we are. For example, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early, take a nap in the morning, and then wake up again in the evening. It took me a few days to get used to this rhythm. When I finally adjusted, I felt like I was really a part of the island. I remember a day in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with some new friends and then took a nap with them on the couch. I realized that this was a common practice in Latin America. I even started to enjoy the unique sounds, smells, and feelings that came with sleeping in a new place. Maybe I should stop feeling guilty about my love of travel sleep and tell my friends that it's an important part of the travel experience.

Here is a revised version of the text, simplified for a learner of English at the C1 level:

The woman turned around from the mirror. ""What do you think? Be honest,"" she said to Mia, her hat stylist. Mia held up a medium-sized hat with a soft, gauzy material and a silk ribbon. ""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said politely. The woman wrinkled her nose and scrunched up her face, looking unimpressed. ""But it's so common,"" she said. ""Every other woman will be wearing a hat like that at my daughter's wedding. This little hat, on the other hand, will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black miniature hat on her head. ""Yes, this is the one I want,"" she said decisively.

Mia knew when to give up and smiled, agreeing that the woman would certainly stand out at the wedding. As she did so, she thought about her own daughter, Jen, who was turning thirty today and was coming over for a family gathering. Mia was looking forward to seeing her and her husband Dan, as well as her son Luke. She was also curious to meet the friend Jen was bringing, a woman named Tattie.

Mia's husband, Jeff, was not a fan of Tattie's unusual name. When Jen had asked if she could bring her friend to the party, Jeff had raised an eyebrow. ""What kind of name is that?"" he had asked. Mia had replied that it was short for Tatiana, which she thought was a nice name. But Jeff wasn't impressed. He didn't like things that were too fancy or showy. He believed in being straightforward and honest, and he would have told the woman in the shop that she was making a mistake by choosing the wrong hat.

Mia, on the other hand, was more diplomatic. She had converted the old barn on their property into a light and airy showroom where she sold hats and accessories. Her business, Mia's Hats, had been a success, thanks in part to her daughter Jen's help in creating a website to promote it. Women came from all over to visit the shop in the village of Little Pelham, where they could try on hats and get advice from Mia on what would suit them best.

Lawrence Okoye has come a long way from London to Atlanta, where he is now considering his next move in his remarkable sporting journey. From competing in the Olympic discus final to the verge of a new challenge, even he seems surprised by the distance he has travelled. Despite never playing American football before, Lawrence is likely to be selected for one of the top teams in the USA. In Atlanta, he is still figuring out his new position. The idea of a 21-year-old novice from London joining one of the biggest teams in American sport is astonishing. However, Lawrence is used to defying expectations.

Lawrence was offered a place at Oxford University to study law, but he postponed it to focus on discus training, which he had started after playing rugby. Within 20 months, he became the world's fourth-best discus thrower. Initially, he came to Atlanta for discus training in the warm weather, preparing for the world championships. However, he soon decided to give American football a try.

When asked about his sudden switch to the NFL, Lawrence says, ""American football was always in the back of my mind, but I didn't seriously consider it until I arrived in the USA. I applied to the NFL trials in Atlanta without thinking I would be good enough to attend. I'm not one to get nervous, and I didn't feel anxious about being tested alongside experienced American football players.""

Lawrence is confident in his abilities, and his performance in various tests and drills impressed the coaches, leading to his selection. He remains cautious, though, as he lacks basic experience. ""I've got all the attributes needed,"" he says. ""It's just about how hard I work.""

Lawrence is not fazed by the prospect of being selected, saying, ""I'm not too bothered."" This calm attitude might stem from his Olympic experience, where he came last in the discus final. He has moved on from the disappointment and takes pride in qualifying for the final. ""That was an amazing day,"" he says. ""The final didn't go as planned, but that's part of sport.""

After his Olympic disappointment, there were rumors that Lawrence's confidence had been shaken. He refuses to comment on this. With a minimum salary of over $400,000 a year, the economic incentives are clear. Lawrence has switched from rugby to athletics and now American football. Some might wonder if he should focus on one sport. ""I can understand why someone would say that,"" he responds. ""I'm trying to achieve something I've dreamed about since I was a schoolkid. If it doesn't work out, I can go back to the discus, the sport I love. Every decision I've made has been calculated.""<|eot_id|>"

We had been flying east for hours when I woke up to see that it was already daylight. Looking out the window, I saw a vast, empty landscape with brown and green hues, which reassured me that it was still early September in Siberia. There was no sign of human life, just mountains, streams, and forests stretching out to the horizon. My neighbour, Sergei, a salesman from Moscow, woke up and smiled at me. 'Good morning, Robert,' he said in his slow, Russian accent. He was on his way to sell safety clothing to local mining companies in the remote areas of Siberia. Although his English was limited, I managed to explain to him that I was flying to Magadan, a city in far-eastern Siberia, with only a one-way ticket. I wanted to return to England by bicycle. Sergei was skeptical, saying there was no road from Magadan. I told him I believed there was a road, although it wasn't well-used. He asked if I was going alone. I said I would be with a friend, Al. He looked unconvinced. I tried to reassure him that I had warm clothes, but didn't mention that I was on a tight budget. I had bought most of my gear at discounted prices. I wasn't sure if it would be enough.

It all started when I was a student in Scotland. One day, I was thinking about a dilemma and decided to ask my friend Al if he wanted to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China that summer. I passed him a note and he agreed. It was six years later that I would join Al in Siberia.

I had been working as a geography teacher and was still improving my skills. The job was challenging, exciting, and had great holidays. I used these holidays to go on adventures with Al. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride in Pakistan and decided to cycle around the world. This trip was his biggest challenge yet. Sometimes, he thought the road would break him, but he was proving to himself that he could overcome each new challenge. He was having an incredible adventure, facing his fears and feeling alive.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 level learner:

In the Red Bull Air Race, 12 pilots compete by flying their planes through a series of 15-25 meter high pylons at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience it for myself. Before the flight, I had to sign two forms: one confirming my good health and the other promising to empty my pockets, as small objects can become dangerous during the flight. I also learned that I needed to stay focused and oriented throughout. The pilot told me that the horizon would be my best guide, and that I should relax when flying upside down and enjoy the view.

Half an hour before the flight, I had a safety briefing, where I was warned not to touch anything in the plane. As we taxied down the runway, I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness. My mind was racing, and I was worried about what was to come.

The pilot, Dario, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, a high-speed acrobatic plane. As we took off, we banked sharply to the right, and I felt my stomach drop. We levelled out, and then turned left, diving down to 2,000 meters. The G-force was intense, and I felt my body weight increasing. We then turned sharply right, aiming for the narrow space between two pylons. The experience was exhilarating, but also a bit overwhelming.

I got to fly the plane for two minutes, and it was incredibly responsive. After that, Dario did a barrel roll and a loop, and I felt a bit queasy. At the top of the loop, I looked up and saw some fields. The flight was over in 10 minutes, and I was relieved when it ended. Dario seemed to enjoy it more than I did, and he even ate a sandwich as soon as we landed. I didn't eat for hours, and that night I had a vivid dream about flying the plane.

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films animals in cold places. If you've seen polar bears in a nature documentary, it's probably his work. His ideal temperature is -18°C. Allan used to be a marine biologist and commercial diver. He learned about surviving in cold places while diving. His big break came when a TV crew came to Antarctica, where he was working, to film a wildlife documentary. He took the crew to different locations and realized that being a wildlife cameraman was perfect for him - it combined travel, adventure, and underwater work.

Allan is now a well-known cameraman and has worked on many big TV wildlife series. He started filming 35 years ago, when camera and communication technology was basic. ""It's much easier to film today,"" he says. ""You can shoot a lot and review it immediately. Back then, you had to think carefully about what shots you needed and what you might miss. Film was expensive, so you shot less."" Allan's expertise lies in his experience filming in cold conditions. He's spent a lot of time on sea ice and now feels comfortable working in these environments.

Wildlife filming can be both successful and challenging. Once, Allan went to the Orkneys to film kittiwakes, but he couldn't identify the birds. Recently, he got permission to film in Kong Karls Land, a group of Arctic islands, but it was a tough assignment. The weather was cold (-32°C) and the snow was deep. After 23 days of walking and waiting, he finally saw a mother bear and her cub. On the 24th day, he felt like he was living in bear country, moving at bear speed and using bear senses.

Allan wants to make a documentary about climate change in the Arctic, focusing on the people who live there and the impact of climate change on their daily lives. He believes he could create an extraordinary film.<|eot_id|>"

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without resupply. He faced extreme cold, frostbite, and polar bears. Eight months later, he reached the South Pole. Now, he's preparing for an even more challenging expedition. This time, he'll be measuring the thickness and density of the Arctic ice with two colleagues. Nobody has done this before, and the results will be crucial for scientists studying global warming.

Pen has always been drawn to adventure. As a child, he was sent out into the Scottish mountains in the middle of blizzards to toughen him up. His father, who loved adventure, passed on his passion to Pen. Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman, who shares his love of the outdoors. She helps run his polar guide business and is worried about him, even when he's at home. They have two children, and this time, Pen is planning to minimize contact with them while he's away.

Pen is joined by two experienced colleagues, Ann Daniels and Martin Hartley, and a support crew of six. He's anxious about the expedition, especially since he's not as well-prepared as he'd like. At 47, he's feeling the pressure to push himself. Pen believes this expedition is important because it will help scientists understand the impact of global warming on the Arctic ice.

I took a year off after my Olympic career. I was wondering what to do with myself. As a successful athlete, I had the opportunity to do more writing, TV work, and speaking engagements. However, I didn't have a new goal to focus on. To stay in shape, I decided to participate in marathons and triathlons. But then, TV presenter Ben Fogle approached me with an invitation: 'Do you want to row across the Atlantic with me?' I had always loved rowing and missed the feeling of gliding through the water. I considered it, but wasn't ready to commit to intense training. I talked to some fellow rowers, but they weren't interested. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win, and having Ben as a partner wouldn't give me the best chance of doing so. On the other hand, being an underdog with no pressure was appealing. I decided to contact Ben, and we discussed the costs of the race, which were £70,000 for the boat and equipment alone. We felt we had a good chance of winning, but it would require a lot of effort. I also had to consider the loss of income from speaking engagements, which was a significant source of income for me. I realized that participating in the race would give me a new goal to work towards and something to talk about. I learned a lot while planning this adventure, including the value of appreciating the easy life as a professional athlete. In the end, I was worried about people's reaction to me racing with a TV presenter, but my concerns disappeared as we prepared for the race. The Atlantic Rowing Race is not just about physical endurance; it's also about mental toughness. Ben had completed some tough challenges, but he lacked experience with rowing. I was surprised by how little he knew about boats, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I should have realized his level of experience before signing up for the race.<|eot_id|>"

I left my job in London to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in Finland. I was 26 and felt restless. I wanted to experience the beauty of the Arctic landscape, which is very different from the noise and crowds of the city. I found a company in Finnish Lapland that specialized in dog-sledding tours and they hired me as a handler. The company had six dogs initially, but soon expanded to over 100.

I joined the team for three months, expecting a challenging experience. The work was physically demanding, with long hours and harsh conditions. I had to learn quickly, as the team relied on me to help with tasks such as feeding and watering the dogs.

On my first day, I was given a list of over 100 husky names to memorize, but I was distracted and anxious. Instead, I looked out the window at the winter landscape. As I traveled to the farm, I saw the darkness of the forest and the snow-covered trees.

When I arrived at the farm, I was given a pair of boots and sent outside into the cold. I followed the sound of barking dogs and saw the team preparing for a tour. The dogs were excited and eager to start, and I was introduced to the team. We set off into the dark, with only a head torch for light.

It took me a while to get used to the tasks and responsibilities, but I quickly learned the basics of dog-sledding. I also learned to chop wood and use tools in the snow. By the end of my first week, I was exhausted but proud of my accomplishments.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 level learner:

On the day of the marathon, Paula Radcliffe crossed the finish line, impressing the press with her exceptional performance. Her time was so good that it would have qualified her to compete in the men's world championships in Paris. Reporters asked her about the benefits of emu oil, a natural treatment recommended by Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman, which had helped Radcliffe recover from an injury caused by a bike accident during training.

Radcliffe didn't fully realize the significance of her achievement at the time. She had set out to push her limits and had no intention of holding back. Her coach and husband, Gary Lough, and physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, were supporting her from the sidelines. Hartmann was worried that Radcliffe was running too fast and might drop out of the race, but Lough and Radcliffe were determined to keep going.

As Radcliffe approached the finish line, she calculated that she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she sprinted the last 800m. She did just that, finishing in 2 hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds. Radcliffe was already thinking about how she could improve her time and return to the marathon the following year.

After the race, everyone was curious about how Radcliffe, with her unusual running style, had beaten the more skilled East African runners. Hartmann credited Radcliffe's ability to handle pain and her dedication to her training, which included daily sessions to counter the 250-300km she ran each week. He described Radcliffe as someone who would wear him down with her intense training and her ability to extract the last ounce of effort from him.

Radcliffe believes that her hard work and mental toughness were key to her success, but she also acknowledges that there are more talented runners out there. She thinks that many athletes focus too much on racing each other and not enough on pushing themselves to their limits. Radcliffe's record has yet to be beaten, and she has inspired many women to take up long-distance running.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level C1 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR):

When I first created my cooking show 'In Search of Perfection', I was worried about how people would react. There was a lot of talk about a food revolution in Britain, and I wondered if my approach to cooking, which combined techniques, history, and science, would be appreciated. The first episode made me feel both excited and nervous. But the show's success paved the way for more projects, including a book based on my experiences at my restaurant. In each project, there's a sense of journey, whether it's exploring the past, the mind, or cooking techniques.

I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying a TV programme of the same name. These books took me on a physical journey, traveling to different places and meeting interesting people. In the latest book, 'In Search of Total Perfection', I traveled around the world to meet artisans who have spent years perfecting their craft. Perfection is subjective, and choosing which dishes to include in the book was a challenge. I knew I would upset some people by leaving out their favorite dishes. However, after discussing it with my team, we came up with a list that included something for everyone.

This reinforced my idea that each person has their own idea of perfection, influenced by their personal experiences, memories, and surroundings. The book's title doesn't claim that the recipes are definitive, but rather that they represent a collection of techniques and knowledge gathered from various sources. The TV series gave me the opportunity to explore new foods, people, and places, and I was excited to do so.

Searching for the best ingredients took me to many different places. Some of my adventures included visiting a canning factory that turned out to be processing the wrong type of tomato and a dairy farm that didn't meet my standards. Refining each recipe required a lot of experimentation, including hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanner, and even trying to get my oven hot enough to make a proper Neapolitan-style pizza.

'You shouldn't spend too much time online, my dad says. But I decided to find out what experts think. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a clear sense of who they are, and are learning important digital skills. Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says that social networking is a natural part of modern childhood. Teenagers don't just use social media occasionally, like adults do, but live it. This isn't good or bad, it's what you do with it that matters.

Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says that social networking is like hanging out at the youth club, where you share jokes and gossip with friends. It helps teenagers develop their identity and learn to deal with their peers. Professor Keith Davidson, a psychologist, says that adolescence is a time when you're trying to figure out who you are. Social networking can help you do this by allowing you to share your interests and discover what you like. Research shows that teenagers who use social media a lot are not as self-absorbed as those who don't.

Professor Andrew Phillips, who studies how younger people use social media, says that it can be helpful for quiet people with special interests. They can connect with others who share their interests and feel less alone. Pauline White, an expert on digital education, says that social networking is becoming a creative force. Teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about things they're interested in. Photo-sharing sites are also transforming creativity, allowing people to learn from each other and improve their skills. This will be beneficial in the workplace, where every business uses social media to sell and increase brand awareness.

Teenagers who use social media creatively will have an advantage when they enter the workforce, agrees Matthews. Many social media sites allow collaboration, which is an important skill in the 21st century and essential for being employable.'

When most people think of a family vacation, they usually imagine a relaxing trip to the beach or a theme park. But my parents had other plans for our summer vacation. They decided to take us on a road trip across nine western states in the US and one Canadian province. My dad seemed to think it was a great idea, but my brother and I were not so sure. We were worried about being stuck in a car for two weeks with no freedom.

We packed our bags and set off on our adventure. The first day was a bit of a shock. We drove through a massive dust storm in Oklahoma, and had to stop for the night in a small town under the stars. The next day, we continued west, and the landscape changed from desert to mountains. We visited the Great Sand Dunes and the town of Pagosa Springs, where we smelled sulfur in the air.

As we traveled, we encountered all sorts of challenges. We got lost in the mountains, and had to navigate through construction traffic. But we also had some amazing experiences, like watching the sunset over Yellowstone National Park and seeing bears roaming freely. We even had a close encounter with a bear on the road, which was a bit scary, but also exciting.

After two weeks on the road, we returned home, tired but happy. We had seen so many incredible sights, and had learned to appreciate the beauty of our own country.

I visited Charlotte's publishers on a winter afternoon. Even though I knew I was going to interview a 15-year-old girl about her book, I was still surprised to see a teenager sitting there. The book is a significant achievement: the writing is confident and engaging. There's nothing about it that suggests it was written by a teenager, except for the age of the main character. Charlotte's publisher is present in case she needs any support, but she doesn't need it. She's a mature and confident person with a lively intelligence.

Charlotte acknowledges the limitations of her youth. I asked her about the complex moral issues she explores in her book. 'I was trying to ask big questions, not answer them,' she replied. 'I don't think my understanding of the world is limited by my age, but neither do I believe I'm particularly wise. I was just interested in exploring the theme of taking responsibility.'

Charlotte has a theory about how teenagers are often portrayed in fiction. She believes that there are three main types of teenage characters: the outsider who becomes accepted by society, the naive teenager who doesn't know much about the world, and the awkward teenager who is not socially skilled. She got frustrated reading about these character types because they often seem inadequate in some way. 'What if you're basically fine?' she asks. 'There aren't many stories about characters who aren't flawed in some way.' Charlotte thinks that this can undermine teenagers' self-confidence.

Charlotte has always been a keen reader of famous fantasy writers, but they almost put her off writing. 'Their books explore deep themes about psychology and life,' she says. 'I was wondering if that's what I had to do to write a good book, and if I was up to it.' However, she praises the influence of a book called How Not to Write a Novel. 'It tells you that if the reader can guess what's going to happen, the suspense is lost.' Charlotte's parents, both journalists, may have helped her get her book published. Her father's acquaintance with someone in publishing got her book read initially. She acknowledges her good fortune, as getting anyone to read a first novel is difficult. 'Every aspiring writer needs support and a lucky break, but after that, you're on your own. Ultimately, writers sink or swim according to their talent, so I don't take things for granted.'<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 level learner:

'As we prepared to ski-jump, our instructor, Gareth, reminded us, ""Speed is your friend, not your enemy."" He asked who wanted to go first, and David, who had some experience, volunteered. David hit the approach ramp fast and jumped, but lost his skis and flipped into the snow. Gareth told us, ""Speed is an unpredictable beast."" I had always thought freestyle skiing looked fun, but I wasn't sure if I was good enough. I had never tried it before and was worried about looking silly.

We were at a training centre in the US, with an indoor facility and trampolines. Students practiced their moves indoors and then went outside to try them on the real jumps. Gareth said, ""Progression is inevitable!"" and warned us about the importance of speed. He explained that if we hit the knuckle (the flat section behind the jump), we'd be in trouble.

At first, I found it hard to convince my body to go fast and ignore my brain's warnings. I would slow down and end up on the knuckle. But Gareth kept encouraging us to control the jump, not let it control us. On the second day, we practiced on the trampolines, which was addictive. Gareth taught us to develop ""aerial awareness"" and control our movements. I struggled at first, but eventually, I landed properly. Gareth was happy, and I felt proud. However, my celebration was short-lived. On the final run, I lost my skis again.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Removed some complex vocabulary and phrases (e.g., ""baggy trousers and special language"", ""aerial awareness"", ""knuckle"" - explained in simpler terms)
* Simplified sentence structures and sentence length
* Removed some descriptive language (e.g., ""shrieking"", ""attempted their new tricks"")
* Kept the main events and ideas, but condensed the text to focus on the most important points.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level C1 on the CEFR:

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your palms are sweaty and your nails are digging into the safety harness. The ride comes to a stop and then slowly starts moving upwards. There's a pause, and then it drops sharply and you feel like your stomach is in the air. You grit your teeth and the ride takes you through a series of sharp turns and drops. You let out a loud scream, but you only have yourself to blame because you paid to ride the rollercoaster.

It's surprising that amusement parks, with their scary rides, are a huge industry. To create the thrill and excitement that people look for, there are many experts behind the scenes, including engineers, designers, and marketing specialists. A rollercoaster designer might seem like a dream job to some people, but it's actually a challenging task. They have to create a balance between fun and fear while making sure riders are safe. They also need to come up with new ideas to keep visitors coming back.

I spoke to three experts who design rollercoasters. One of them, Professor Brendan Walker, said that the key to a good rollercoaster is combining different elements. Dr. John Roberts, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, explained that the goal is to create a sense of excitement and thrill while keeping riders safe. He said that it's a fine line between being thrilling and feeling uncomfortable.

To create the best ride, rollercoaster designers need to come up with a story or theme that works with the ride's features, such as its height, twists, and drops. They also need to test their rides before opening them to the public. As one of the experts said, it helps to be someone who loves thrill rides and can understand what riders want.

I asked the experts if they thought rollercoaster design would change with new technology, such as virtual reality. One of them said that while new technology can add something extra, the physical rollercoaster experience will remain the most important part of the ride.

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of English at level C1:

Miranda Ellington is a successful choreographer at 25. She has worked with many theatres and dance companies. Despite her busy schedule, she still dances occasionally. I'm curious to know why she does this. 'It reminds me of what it's like to be a dancer again, taking orders from choreographers and feeling tense and frustrated,' she says. As a choreographer, she enjoys teaching young students. 'They are open to new ideas and willing to take risks. They're hungry for success, but they don't know their strengths and weaknesses yet, so they can take criticism well.'

When Miranda starts working with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. 'I might not like a piece of music, but I still come up with a good dance routine to go with it. If dancers don't like the music, it can be frustrating, but I have to find a solution.'

Miranda doesn't like to work with just one institution. 'It's important to meet new people and adapt to different styles and methods.' This means she has to be flexible and not stick to one way of working.

We talked about a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. 'It showed the hard work and dedication involved in ballet. The public often underestimates how much effort it takes.'

I asked Miranda what makes a great ballet or dance production. 'It's when everything comes together - the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. It's not always perfect, but aiming high is appreciated by the audience.'

Miranda has worked on many different projects and I asked her if she sees herself as a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist. 'People like to put labels on you, but I don't agree with that. I want to keep exploring different styles and genres.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Simplified vocabulary and sentence structures

* Shortened some sentences to make them easier to understand
* Removed some of the more abstract concepts and focused on the main ideas

Here is the simplified text:

I once had a conversation with a friend about why I like to travel instead of just watching TV. My friend asked me why I bother when I can see amazing things on TV. I agreed that TV can show us a lot, but there's no substitute for experiencing things firsthand. This conversation inspired me to go on a unique adventure. A friend was getting rid of an old sofa, so I decided to take it with me on a four-day trip. I fixed the sofa so it could move, and attached seatbelts to my shoulders to make it easier to pull. I slept on the sofa each night, even on the beach one night. Some friends joined me on the way, helping me to pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. This was a new kind of adventure for me, as I'd never walked such a long distance before, and it was on main roads, so I could stop at cafes and relax on the sofa with a coffee. When people asked me about my weekend, I liked to tell them about my sofa adventure instead of talking about the latest TV show. You can see a film about my trip on my website.

Here's a simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at the C1 level:

When I read about guided swimming trips in the Greek islands, I was thrilled. I had never been on an organized group trip before. My brother was busy, so I decided to join a group holiday. The man at the port was surprised when I asked for a single ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained that I would be joining a group of ten people to swim around the small islands. Although he looked puzzled, he showed me on board with a smile. Before we set off, our group had exchanged emails, but we didn't have much time to chat before our first swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would be with us throughout, and taught us how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide us into speed groups, and then it was time for our first 1.5 km swim. I was a bit nervous, as I had only swum short distances in my local pool and in rivers, but never in the open sea. As we swam, the waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group. I watched the faster swimmers ahead of me, who seemed to be gliding through the water like dolphins. I was determined to complete the first distance on my own, and I was relieved when I finally did. The next few days followed a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable pace, and stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, I got faster and more confident, and I didn't need the support boat as much. I'm already looking forward to going back next year.

I made some minor changes to the text to make it more accessible to a C1 level learner, including:

Here's a simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at the C1 level:

I won't deny that being a flight attendant is not an easy job. However, I've been fortunate enough to travel to many countries, including the US and Australia. I work with a great team and have a good work-life balance. It's a job that's never dull, which makes it perfect for someone like me who is young and adventurous.

As a child, I attended a boarding school abroad and often flew alone. I would ask the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers, and some of them agreed. This experience stuck with me, and when I was looking for a change from my banking job, I remembered it. I decided to apply for a job as a flight attendant and was accepted.

The interview was competitive, with many young and highly qualified candidates. To stand out, I highlighted my strengths and previous work experience. I got the job and would recommend it to anyone. While it's not all about the free flights, there are many things that make this job worthwhile. The airline staff are hardworking, and we're like a big family, even though we don't always see each other. When I'm not working, I don't have to worry about work-related tasks, and if I do encounter difficult passengers, I know it's only temporary.

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of English at level C1:

At the summer camp where I work, I love seeing the children achieve things they never thought they could do. Most of them know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is a new experience for many. Some children feel nervous, but after encouragement, they agree to try and eventually reach the top. This gives them a great sense of accomplishment. We do have children who miss home at the beginning of the week, but it's mostly the 10- to 13-year-olds who feel this way. We don't let them use their phones all the time. First, we allow them to phone home after lunch, and then we tell them it's too late to call now, try again tomorrow. Most children settle in within a couple of days and by the end of their stay, they all thank us for a great time. It's not just the children who feel lonely. We also get parents who call non-stop, asking about their child's progress, which is unnecessary. Often, their child is busy playing or doing something else, so we have to ask them to call back later. We occasionally get children who arrive dressed in expensive new clothes. These children usually argue when we ask them to change into something more suitable, but soon they understand the reason.

Here is the simplified version of the text for a C1 level learner:

""Rock the Planet, a musical show where actors also need to be good musicians, opened in London last year after five years in the USA. The show was a huge success in America, winning 'Best Musical' four times. However, bringing the show to London was challenging because of the different rules about how many performances young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows, but in the UK, they have to follow stricter rules. To solve this problem, the director found many talented UK-based actors. The show's first performance in London was a huge success, with the theatre being full every night. People loved the show because they had heard the songs before and wanted to see them performed live.

I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He told me that he loves playing his guitar and that it's great that he gets paid to do something he enjoys. He also mentioned that the young actors have to attend school at the theatre during the day and that they have to work hard to balance their schoolwork and rehearsals. Jamie's friends from school even came to see the show, and they all loved it. When I told Jamie that I also play guitar, he offered to teach me a song called 'Days'. I was impressed by his skills and had fun playing with him and the other young actors. They had never played in a band before, but they found it easy to learn. The only challenge they faced was looking natural on stage when they first started performing together. They were so focused on playing their instruments that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and I highly recommend it.""
