Some time ago, a website warned people about sharing their whereabouts online. The website said that when you share where you are, you are also sharing your personal life with many people, not all of whom you might want to meet. This is a reminder that there are risks to sharing too much online.
The internet offers many opportunities to share our lives with others. We can share photos, stories, and even our personal thoughts. But before we do, we should think about the consequences. In the past, some people who shared their lives online faced problems. They lost their jobs, friends, or even their reputation.
In the early days of the internet, a group of people called bloggers were the first to share their lives online. They faced many challenges and learned valuable lessons. One of these bloggers, Justin Hall, started sharing his life online in 1994. He wrote about his personal life, including his relationships and thoughts. However, he faced problems when his loved one told him to stop sharing their relationship online or they would end it.
Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, shared her life online and faced similar problems. She lost her job after her colleagues found her blog and didn't like what they read. However, she learned from her experience and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a successful blogger and writer.
The story of these bloggers teaches us an important lesson. Just because we can share our lives online, it doesn't mean we should. We should think carefully about what we share and how it might affect our lives."

Some scientists were upset about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? It's a mix of documentary and drama that shows how little we know about the universe. While it's true that scientists don't know everything, some experts felt the need to warn people about the film's claims. They thought it was misleading and even dangerous.
I watched the film and didn't understand the fuss at first. Scientists were saying that new discoveries were showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. It wasn't until the film talked about some of these discoveries that I started to understand the controversy. For example, did you know that water molecules can be affected by thought? I had heard about a Japanese researcher who showed that the shape of water molecules can change just by thinking about it. The film showed some pictures of ice crystals that looked different depending on the mood of the person talking to them. Many people find this idea amazing and want to believe it's true.
However, scientists are skeptical. They want more proof before they accept this claim. Pretty pictures aren't enough evidence. The real problem is that the film didn't go far enough. The truth is that scientists are discovering things that are even more amazing. For example, they've found that the universe is made up of an unknown form of matter and is being pushed by a mysterious force called ""dark energy"". They've also found that our brains edit out a delay in our perception of events, and that the birthplace of modern humans has been discovered. Some scientists even think they've found a link between the existence of life on Earth and the design of the universe.
The truth is that science is still far from knowing everything. We're actually getting closer to realizing that many things can never be fully understood. This has led some scientists to try to create a ""Theory of Everything"" that explains all the forces and particles in the universe. Many people believe that the universe is incredible, and that's the best way to sum it up."

Writing novels is a big challenge, while writing short stories is more enjoyable. It's like comparing planting a forest to planting a garden. Both processes are important and complement each other. When I finish a novel, I usually want to write some short stories. And after completing a group of short stories, I feel like focusing on a novel again. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and vice versa. This is because the two types of writing engage different parts of my brain.
I started writing short stories in the 1980s, and it was a new experience for me. I learned a lot and felt more creative. My readers appreciated this new side of me as a writer. One of my earliest short stories, ""Breaking Waves"", was included in my first short-story collection, ""Tales from Abroad"".
I enjoy writing short stories because they don't take as long to finish. It usually takes me a week to write a decent short story, and then I can move on. Writing novels, on the other hand, can take a year or two, and it feels like a big commitment. Writing short stories is a nice change of pace for me.
Another good thing about short stories is that I can create a story from a small idea or image. It's like jazz improvisation, and the story takes me where it wants to go. If an idea doesn't work out, I don't worry about it. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write masterpieces. I find this comforting. I can learn from my mistakes and use them in my next story.
For me, writing short stories is like an experimental laboratory for my novels. It helps me try new things and learn from my successes and failures. Without short stories, I would find it even harder to write novels. My short stories are like little footprints I've left behind, and I'm happy to share them with my readers."

Science is a vast and complex field that has both helped and harmed humanity. It has made our lives easier and more comfortable, but it has also created problems and uncertainties. Scientists have made many important discoveries, but they have also disagreed and argued about the meaning of their findings. This book looks at the history of science and the ideas that have changed the way we think about the world. We will explore the beauty and limitations of scientific discoveries, and examine how they have affected our understanding of the universe and our place in it.
Science is constantly changing, and new discoveries often challenge our previous understanding of the world. Sometimes, these changes are small and gradual, while other times they are revolutionary and lead to major shifts in our understanding. Despite its limitations, science has made significant progress over the centuries, and it continues to shape our understanding of the world and our ability to manipulate it.
However, science is not without its risks. The pursuit of scientific knowledge has led to both benefits and harm, and we must be aware of the potential consequences of our actions. As non-scientists, we should be informed about the advances being made and their potential impact on our lives and the world around us. The manipulation of the future is a responsibility that we all share, and it is crucial that we understand the role that science plays in shaping our destiny.

For many years, the sales of ebooks grew rapidly. However, around 2015, major publishers started to notice that sales had slowed down or even decreased in some cases. This made people wonder if ebooks would continue to be popular in the future. Some people even thought that the hype around ebooks had led to unwise investments, and that companies had lost faith in the power of physical books.
Despite the fact that digital and print books can coexist, the idea that ebooks will replace print books still sparks debate. We might not like to admit it, but the idea of a medium 'killing' another is a powerful one. It's not just about ebooks and print books, but about how we react to new technologies in general.
In the past, people have predicted the demise of various media, such as radio, television, and movies, when new technologies emerged. But these predictions were often wrong. For example, radio didn't die when television was invented; instead, it found new uses. Similarly, the introduction of the phonograph in 1894 didn't mean the end of books, as people started listening to audiobooks.
When new technologies come along, we often form strong emotional bonds with them. We might even give names to our devices or get upset when they don't work properly. As a result, when a new technology emerges, we feel a sense of loss for what we used to have. This is why we often see a resurgence of interest in older technologies, like vinyl records or film cameras.
The idea of the 'death of the book' is a common narrative that reflects our mixed feelings about change. We might be excited about the possibilities of new technology, but we also fear losing something important. This narrative is easy to remember and spread, and it helps us make sense of the changes we're experiencing.

For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday morning at 5:30. I brushed my teeth, made some coffee, and sat down to write about how famous people throughout history managed their daily routines. I wanted to show how they found time to do their best work, organized their schedules, and stayed creative and productive. By looking at the small details of their daily lives - what they ate, when they slept, and how they worked - I hoped to give a new perspective on their personalities and careers.
The French writer Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, 'Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are.' I say, 'Tell me when you eat and take a nap, and I'll tell you how you work.' This book is about the daily habits of creative people, not just their achievements. It's about how they made time for their work and managed their daily routines.
My own struggles with balancing creative work and earning a living led me to write this book. I wanted to know how others handled these challenges. How do you find time to do meaningful work while also making a living? Is it better to focus on one project or divide your time between several? And what do you do when you don't have enough time for everything? I don't claim to have the answers, but I've tried to show how many successful and talented people have dealt with these same challenges.
The book is called Daily Rituals, but I'm really interested in people's routines. The word 'routine' often means being on autopilot, but in the right hands, a routine can be a powerful tool for getting things done. A good routine can help you make the most of your time, energy, and optimism.
I started this project by accident. I was supposed to write an article, but instead, I spent the day tidying my office and making coffee. I realized that other writers had similar habits, and I decided to collect these stories and share them with others. The book is a bigger and more researched version of that original idea. I've tried to keep the stories brief and diverse, and I've let the people themselves speak for the most part.
I want to thank the many researchers, biographers, and journalists who helped me with this project. You can find their sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also give you some suggestions for further reading."

Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in his family's plans when he was six years old. His father had to cancel their holiday to Spain due to rising interest rates. Instead, they went to the English coast, where Howard found an ammonite on the beach. This sparked his interest in palaeontology. As he grew older, his focus shifted from the more spectacular dinosaurs to the earliest life forms on Earth. He studied these ancient creatures and eventually wrote his doctoral thesis.
After completing his thesis, Howard was unsure if he would get a job as a palaeontologist. He applied for a position at Tavistock College in London, but wasn't confident he would get it. However, the professor who was meant to chair the interview panel got into a fight with his wife and couldn't attend. A different professor, who didn't like Howard's mentor, took his place and helped Howard get the job.
Howard was surprised but grateful for the opportunity. He was relieved to have a job that allowed him to do the work he loved. However, he soon realized that his professional life was very different from his personal life. He often felt like he had no control over what happened to him. For example, his briefcase containing his lecture notes was stolen at a train station, and he had to cancel his lecture.
Later, Howard met a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi, who told him about a new collection of fossils that had been acquired but not yet studied. This was a great opportunity for Howard, and he quickly rearranged his plans to visit the museum and study the fossils. He was grateful for the unexpected turn of events that led him to this new opportunity.

Professor Charles Spence is a food scientist who studies how our senses work together to create the taste of food. He is a professor at Oxford University in the UK and has worked with big food companies to help them create new products. He has also worked with famous chefs to create new dishes.
Spence's research has shown that many things can affect how we taste food, such as who we eat with, the color and texture of the plate, and even the background noise. He has written a book called ""The Perfect Meal"" that explains these findings.
Spence's lab is not high-tech, but it is full of creative ideas. He works with chefs to create new dishes and has helped big food companies reduce salt and sugar in their products. He believes that people will eat healthier if they don't notice the changes.
Spence has also worked with famous chefs, including Heston Blumenthal, to create new dishes that use sound to enhance the flavor. He has found that certain sounds can make food taste sweeter or bitter. An airline is now using his research to match music with food served to passengers.
At home, Spence likes to have fun with his family. They have had dinner parties where they eat unusual foods, such as rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery. They also play with light bulbs and tone generators to see how different sounds affect the taste of food.
Overall, Spence's work is all about understanding how our senses work together to create the taste of food and how we can use this knowledge to create new and exciting dishes."

Our brains are busier than ever. We're constantly bombarded with information, some of which is true, some of which is false. We have to sort through it all to find what we need. At the same time, we're doing more things on our own. Thirty years ago, travel agents and salespeople helped us with tasks. Now we do them ourselves. We're doing the work of 10 people, but we're still trying to keep up with our personal and professional lives.
Our smartphones help us do all this, but they can also be a problem. We think we're multitasking, but in reality, we're just switching between tasks quickly. This can be tiring and stressful. Multitasking can even make us less efficient and less focused. It can also make us feel anxious and overwhelmed.
Research shows that our brains are not designed to multitask well. When we try to do multiple things at once, we're actually switching between tasks quickly, which can be confusing. This can lead to mistakes and poor decisions.
Email is a big problem. We feel like we have to respond to every message, but it's hard to keep up. It's not just the volume of emails that's the issue, it's also the constant distractions. We're constantly switching between tasks and emails, which can be exhausting.
In conclusion, our brains are busier than ever, and multitasking can be a problem. We need to learn to focus and prioritize our tasks to avoid feeling overwhelmed and stressed."

In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino would break up concrete and throw it at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other female bats who are having trouble having babies. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought animals just did things without feelings or thoughts. But now, scientists are starting to study animal emotions. They are looking at the behavior of bats, chimpanzees, rats, dolphins, and chickens. This has led to a debate: can animals think and feel like humans do? 
This debate has also led to a question about whether animals have a sense of right and wrong. In an experiment with cows, some cows had to open a gate to get food. The cows that opened the gate themselves seemed happier than the ones that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for the way we treat them? 
Some scientists think that humans should stop eating meat because of this new research. Others think we should just learn more about animal intelligence. There are different opinions on this topic, and it's hard to know what to think. It's a complex issue that involves science, ethics, and philosophy. Can we ever really know what it's like to be another animal? 
In an experiment with starlings, some birds were kept in nice cages and some were kept in small, dirty cages. The birds in the nice cages seemed to lose hope when they were given bad food. This makes us wonder if animals can get depressed. Some scientists think that animals have feelings and thoughts, and we should treat them with respect. Others think we should be careful not to attribute human emotions to animals. 
It's a topic that will continue to be debated, and there is no easy answer."

Critical thinking is a way of analyzing what we read or listen to in order to understand it better. Adrian West, a researcher at the Edward de Bono Foundation in the UK, believes that argument is a way to find the truth. While technology can help us store and process information, it's changing the way we approach complex problems and making it harder to think deeply. West says that we're exposed to more poor quality thinking, fads, and opinions, which can be overwhelming.
In fact, despite having more data and information, our thinking hasn't improved. The National Endowment for the Arts reports that reading has declined by 10 percentage points, and this trend is getting worse. Many experts, including Patricia Greenfield, a professor of psychology, think that focusing on visual media has a negative impact. She says that reading is essential for critical thinking, and that the emphasis on real-time media and multi-tasking is making it harder for people to focus.
However, it's not that simple. Technology can have both positive and negative effects on critical thinking. For example, a computer game can promote critical thinking or hinder it. Reading on the internet can improve our analytical skills, but browsing through endless links can make it harder to think deeply. Greenfield analyzed over 50 studies on learning and technology and found that visual media can improve some types of information processing, but they often don't allow time for reflection, analysis, or imagination.
As a result, many people, especially younger ones, are not reaching their full potential. The way we view technology affects how we think about critical thinking. For example, some people believe that video games are bad for kids, but James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, says that they can be a valuable tool for learning. Games like Sim City and Civilization can teach decision-making and analytical skills in a virtual environment that resembles the real world.
In conclusion, it's clear that technology is changing the way we think and analyze information. We need to understand the subtleties of how it affects our thinking and make sure we're using it effectively to improve our critical thinking skills."

Matthew Crawford is a writer and a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office, but he got tired of it and decided to change careers. His books are about the benefits of manual work and how to deal with modern life. In his latest book, he talks about how technology is affecting our ability to focus and connect with others.
Crawford noticed that when he was shopping, ads would pop up on the credit card machine while he was entering his PIN number. He realized that we're constantly being interrupted and distracted by technology. We're losing the ability to think and remember things, and we're becoming more isolated.
Everyone is trying to protect themselves from distractions, so we're all closing ourselves off and avoiding social interactions. We're encountering the world through screens and apps, which can be manipulative. Crawford thinks that this is affecting our ability to connect with others and our sense of self.
Some people might think that technology is the problem, but Crawford believes it's more about how we're using technology. We're using it to escape from the world and from ourselves. We're constantly bombarded with choices and options, which can be overwhelming.
Crawford suggests that we need to find ways to engage with the world in a more meaningful way. He gives the example of people who work with their hands, like cooks, athletes, and motorbike riders. They have to focus on the present moment and deal with the world around them. This helps them develop good judgment and the ability to connect with others.
Crawford's solution is to find ways to use our judgment and focus on the present moment. This can be challenging, but it can also be rewarding. When we're able to focus on one thing, we're better able to connect with others and find meaning in our lives.

""What do you do for a living?"" is a common question we ask each other. It's a way to introduce ourselves and define who we are. However, when you're a philosopher, like me, it's a bit tricky. Saying you're a philosopher can sound pretentious, as if you're claiming to have some special knowledge or insight that others don't. But this isn't true. Philosophers are just people who think deeply about the world and try to understand it.
One reason people think philosophers are special is that we often talk about big ideas and judge the actions of others. Ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle and Socrates believed that a life of contemplation was the most important one. Many people still think that philosophy is about being a wise and thoughtful person. But this isn't necessarily true. Philosophy is about thinking carefully about the world and our place in it.
Another reason people have a wrong idea about philosophers is that academic philosophy has become separated from everyday life. Many philosophers write books and articles that are only read by other experts. This makes it hard for ordinary people to understand what philosophers do. To change this, we need to make philosophy more accessible and relevant to people's daily lives.
As an ethicist, I focus on questions about what is right and wrong. But philosophy is more than just thinking about rules and laws. It's about exploring our values and attitudes towards the world. By asking questions like ""Is it okay to download music illegally?"" or ""How do we think about responsibility?"", we can gain a deeper understanding of ourselves and the world around us.
Philosophy is not just for experts or intellectuals. It's for anyone who wants to think critically and make sense of their life. By examining our ideas and beliefs, we can make better decisions and live more thoughtfully."""

Food is a fascinating topic that can be explored from different perspectives. Historically, philosophers have not given much thought to the subject, but rather used it as a metaphor for other ideas. However, food is more than just a means to an end; it is a fundamental part of our daily lives and our culture. The way we eat and what we eat is influenced by our social and cultural backgrounds.
Epicurus, an ancient Greek philosopher, believed in the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain. Although he didn't focus specifically on food, his ideas have been associated with a love of eating and drinking. Today, we see his name used in restaurants, food shops, and online recipe sites.
Food is a social activity that brings people together. We share meals with our friends and family, and it's an important part of our community. Food critics write about their experiences, but their expertise is not necessarily in taste, but rather in describing what they taste.
The aesthetics of food have also been overlooked. While we admire beautiful paintings and music, we rarely talk about the beauty of food. Some philosophers argue that food has earned its place in aesthetic discussions, but it's a unique case because it's meant to be consumed and enjoyed.
Ethical questions surround food, such as what we should eat and how we should produce it. Philosophers ask these questions to understand our values and beliefs. Cooking for others can also raise interesting questions about our responsibilities and relationships.
Food can also play a role in bridging cultural gaps. By sharing meals with people from other cultures, we can learn about their traditions and build personal connections. A recent essay explored this idea and provided many examples and anecdotes to illustrate the power of food in diplomacy.

Rob Daviau, an American game designer, wanted to create a new type of board game that would be more exciting and challenging than traditional games. He started by modifying a classic game called Risk, creating a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, players' decisions have a lasting impact, and they may have to tear up cards or damage the board. The game is played over several sessions, and players can see how their actions affect the game over time.
Daviau was then asked to work on a legacy version of the popular cooperative game Pandemic. His next project was a game called SeaFall, which is set in the age of sail. In this game, players become sailors trying to explore and conquer a new world.
To create a legacy game, designers need to think about all the possible choices players can make and ensure that the story doesn't fall apart. They test the game with players to see how it unfolds. One tester, Jaime Barriga, said it takes a lot of time and effort to play the game, but it's worth it.
Daviau didn't expect legacy games to become popular, but they have attracted a lot of attention. Many players love the idea of playing a game that changes and evolves over time. Russell Chapman, a fan of legacy games, said it's exciting to learn new things and discover new ways to play. Ben Hogg, another fan, said that the appeal of an unfolding adventure is more important than concerns about the game's longevity.
The legacy format has been influenced by video games and the demand for episodic entertainment, like TV series. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, compared the legacy design process to writing a novel. Daviau is happy to see where others take the idea, but he also thinks that gamers will soon be looking for something new.
Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is excited about the legacy format and thinks it will change the way people think about board games."

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the New Zealand Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and slipped into a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This amazing story was shared online and many people enjoyed it. People like to imagine that animals are like us, and octopuses are especially interesting because of their intelligence. They can open jars, recognize faces, and even play. Some people think it's fun to imagine animals doing human-like things, but others believe it's not scientific.
Dr. Frans de Waal, a scientist who studies primates, says that it's not unscientific to imagine animals like us, but rather the opposite - not recognizing their human-like traits. He studied many animals and found that they can do many things that were thought to be unique to humans, such as thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding others' motives.
In the past, people thought animals were very intelligent, but this changed in the 20th century with the rise of behaviorism. This approach focused on training animals through rewards and punishments, and many people thought animals were just machines or robots. However, this view is changing, and we're now recognizing that animals have internal lives and are capable of complex behaviors.
Dr. de Waal believes that we're learning to see animal cognition as being on the same spectrum as human cognition, but not necessarily at the same level. He thinks that the best way to test animal intelligence is to design tests that take into account each species' unique abilities. For example, squirrels are great at remembering where they hide nuts, while humans need apps to find their phones.
Dr. de Waal is skeptical about Inky's escape story, but he believes that viral stories like this can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys can experience envy, and the results were surprising. The monkeys became upset when they saw their peers getting a better treat. The study was published in a scientific journal, but it was the one-minute video clip that really convinced people of the findings."

Robotics is a rapidly growing field that is expected to revolutionize many industries. While robots have been used in manufacturing and automotive sectors for a while, experts predict that they will soon be used in many other areas as well. However, many people are not prepared for this change. Some people think that robots will replace most human jobs, but others believe that many jobs will remain the same. The truth is that every industry will be affected by robots in the next few years.
For example, a company in Australia has developed a robot that can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, which would take two human bricklayers a whole day to do. Another robot, called Tally, roams supermarket aisles to ensure that goods are properly stocked and priced. Robots are not yet able to service or program themselves, which will create new jobs for technicians and programmers.
Some experts think that the introduction of robots will lead to new, high-paying jobs, while others warn that we need to consider the importance of human skills in the workplace. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, a world expert on robotics, believes that society is not prepared for the changes that robots will bring.
According to Dr. Zhang's research, in the next two years, almost one-third of robots will be able to work with other robots and humans safely. Within three years, many companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will have created laws to regulate robots. In five years, salaries in the robotics sector will increase by at least 60%, but many jobs will remain vacant due to a shortage of skilled workers.
Dr. Zhang advises that people should not rely on the government to protect their jobs from technology, but instead, they should be willing to retrain themselves to adapt to the changing job market. He believes that this is the only way to stay ahead in the job market.
In the future, we can expect to see new types of robots that will interact with us in our daily lives. This presents both opportunities and challenges, such as the need for new regulations to ensure our safety and privacy. To prepare for the robotic workforce of the future, we need to focus on education, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)."

Many people wonder why climbers risk their lives to climb mountains. The famous mountaineer George Mallory said, ""Because it's there."" This answer might inspire some people to chase their dreams. Climbing can be a thrilling adventure and a way to challenge oneself. 
There are different types of climbing, from easy to difficult, and each has its own rules. Climbers choose their style of climbing based on the rules of the game they're playing. For many, climbing gives them a sense of freedom. However, it can also be confining and restrictive, especially when they're stuck in a tent during bad weather.
Some people argue that climbing is a way to cultivate important values like courage, humility, and respect for nature. Climbing can also help people develop these values in a world that is often risk-averse. 
Another idea is that climbers who climb independently, without help from others or technology, have to be fully committed to their goal. This can make their achievements more impressive. However, some people think that this emphasis on independence can lead to unnecessary risks.
Climbing can also be a way to be in the moment, to focus on the physical activity and problem-solving involved, and to experience a sense of flow. Some people even compare climbing to Zen philosophy, which aims to achieve a state of perfect peace. 
When we ask why people climb, we can explore these different perspectives and find our own reasons."

One of the most significant changes in education in the UK and around the world is the encouragement of students to participate in research from the early stages of their studies. This recognizes that research is not only for famous scholars or scientists, but it's a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in your future career, as they help you think critically and solve problems.
As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions and finding answers. You don't just memorize information; you make it by exploring and analyzing it. Research involves asking questions like ""Why?"", ""How?"", ""What if?"", and ""How does it work?"" to understand the world and make new discoveries.
Research can be complex and groundbreaking, but it can also be a simple, everyday process of asking questions and seeking answers. You may have already been doing research in your daily life, such as when you're planning a trip, fixing something, or finding the right product online.
In college and university, you're expected to develop your research skills by asking questions, exploring ideas, and constructing your own knowledge. This can be challenging, especially if you're used to following established knowledge and authority. However, in UK, US, European, and Australian higher education, it's important to question established knowledge and think critically about what you read and hear.
Critical thinking is essential in research. You need to engage with what you read, think about it, test it, and identify whether it's logical and backed by evidence. Don't just accept information without questioning it; instead, analyze it and make your own decisions.

Here is a simplified version of the text, making it more suitable for a B2 level learner:
Cities have always been important centers of intellectual activity. Think of the coffee houses in 18th-century London, where people gathered to discuss science and politics, or the cafes in modern Paris, where artist Pablo Picasso talked about modern art. However, city life is not always easy. The same cafes that sparked interesting conversations also helped spread diseases like cholera. Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. The modern city is a place of creativity, but it can also be overwhelming and unnatural.
Scientists are now studying how cities affect our brains, and the results are surprising. While it's well-known that city life can be exhausting, research suggests that cities can actually make us less intelligent. One reason is the lack of nature. Studies have shown that patients recover faster when they can see trees from their hospital windows. Even just a glimpse of nature can improve our brain function because it gives us a break from the city's constant stimulation.
This research is important because most people now live in cities. Instead of living in open spaces, we're surrounded by concrete and millions of strangers. In recent years, it's become clear that our unnatural environment has a big impact on our mental and physical health. Cities can also change how we think.
When you walk down a busy street, your brain has to process a lot of information: people walking in different directions, traffic, and the confusing layout of the city. This constant mental effort can leave us feeling drained. The reason is that our brains have to work hard to focus on what's important and ignore what's not. This takes a lot of energy and effort.
Natural settings, on the other hand, don't require as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory. Psychologist Stephen Kaplan first proposed it. He thought that being in nature could help our brains rest and recover.
Before scientists studied this, philosophers and landscape architects were already warning about the effects of city life and looking for ways to include nature in urban planning. Parks like Central Park in New York can provide a break from city life and even improve our brain function. Taking a walk in nature can be a simple way to boost our cognitive performance.
Despite the challenges of city life, people continue to move to cities because they are hubs of intellectual activity. Research at the Santa Fe Institute found that the same features that can make cities overwhelming – crowded streets and close quarters – are also what make them creative hotspots. The concentration of social interactions is key to urban innovation.
The challenge is to find ways to mitigate the negative effects of city life while maintaining its benefits."

Where should we look for our thoughts and ideas? It might seem obvious that our brains are the source of our thoughts, but I think we should consider the role of objects in our thinking process. 
Archaeologists have found many examples of how objects, like tools and symbols, have been used by humans throughout history to help us think and understand the world. This shows that our thoughts and ideas are not just limited to our brains, but are also influenced by the objects around us. 
Many people think that our minds are just our brains, but I believe that our minds are more than just our brains. I think our minds are shaped by the objects we use and the culture we live in. 
I have developed a theory called Material Engagement Theory (MET), which looks at how objects become a part of our thinking process. For example, when we use a stick to help us navigate, it becomes an extension of our body. This theory helps us understand how our minds work and how they have changed over time.
Think of a blind person using a cane. Where does their self begin? The cane is an extension of their body, and it helps them to feel and understand the world. This shows that our minds are not fixed and can change and adapt as we use new objects and technologies.
My theory sees the human mind as a project that is still being developed and changed by our interactions with the world around us. We have always used objects to help us think and understand the world, and this is what makes us human. I want to show that our minds are not just in our brains, but are shaped by the objects and culture we use.

Photography has had a huge impact on our way of life and how we understand the world. In the United States, photography became an important part of the country's culture, culture, and art. Many historians consider photography to be the country's greatest contribution to the visual arts.
So, why was photography so appealing? One reason was that it was a mechanical process, which fit with the growing enthusiasm for technology in the US. Just like how trains, electricity, and other innovations made the world smaller, photography brought the world into people's homes in a way that was exciting and new.
Another reason was that the camera was a tool for people to show themselves to others. In the US, people believed that individuals and national identities were constantly being created and re-created. Photography allowed people to present themselves to the public in a way that was new and exciting.
Photography also became important for families, as a way to record and remember special moments. It was a way to create a sense of identity and shared history.
Finally, photography's realistic style fit with the artistic trend of realism in the US. Photographs were seen as a way to show people what was real, and to make them think about what was important.
Photographs are special because they are a record of what was in front of the camera, but they also have the photographer's point of view. This means that photographs can have different meanings depending on the context in which they are seen.
In the past, photographers kept their techniques secret, but today, many artists use photographs in their work. In fact, photography has become an essential part of art, and is often used alongside painting.

William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the'science of mental life' in 1890. This definition is still relevant today. Psychology is the study of our mental lives, which includes our thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Each of us has a unique mental life, and our understanding of it is based on our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences.
Psychologists are interested in understanding human psychology, which includes our thoughts, feelings, and experiences. They try to understand how we think, feel, and behave. However, it's difficult to study the mind directly, so psychologists often study our behavior instead. They use this information to make educated guesses about what's going on inside our minds.
Psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle. Psychologists gather clues from careful observation and use logical arguments to make sense of them. They also develop theories and techniques to help them understand complex interactions between our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.
Psychologists aim to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes they study. Their findings can be applied to many areas, such as education, design, and helping people cope with emotional distress.
In the past, psychologists used a method called introspection, where they reflected on their own experiences to understand the mind. However, this method has limitations. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of others' behavior rather than their own experiences.

Here is a simplified version of the text, targeted at a B2 level learner:
In a warehouse in Michigan, USA, there's a special collection of products that failed to sell well. This collection is called the Museum of Failed Products. It's a unique place where you can find products like A Touch of Yogurt shampoo and Breakfast Cola, which were not popular with consumers. The museum's owner, Carol Sherry, sees each product as a story of failure for the designers, marketers, and salespeople involved.
What's surprising is that this museum is a profitable business. Many companies might think it's a good idea to keep a collection of failed products, but they rarely do. The museum's owner, Robert McMath, started collecting products in the 1960s, thinking he would create a reference library. However, he ended up with mostly unsuccessful products because most products fail.
This might be due to the culture of optimism in business. Companies often invest more money in products that are not doing well, hoping to make some sales and save face. People involved in the process might not discuss their failures openly, as it's not seen as a positive thing.
In the self-help industry, there's a popular idea called ""positive visualization,"" which suggests that if you imagine something going well, it will happen. However, research has shown that this approach can actually decrease motivation to achieve goals. Psychologists have found that people who are overly optimistic about their abilities tend to be less accurate in their assessments of their abilities than those who are more realistic.
The way we view failure is also important. Some people believe that ability is innate and that failure is a sign of not being good enough. Others believe that ability can be developed through hard work and challenge. Those who believe in the latter approach view failure as an opportunity to learn and grow.
This way of thinking is associated with happiness, regardless of whether it leads to success."

Sports teams often perform better when they play at home. But why is this? Many people think it's obvious, but professional sports are changing, and we need to question our assumptions. Two important factors are science and money. Scientists want to understand what makes players perform well, and they have come up with many theories about home advantage. Meanwhile, team owners want to know why home advantage is still important. If players are paid well, shouldn't they feel comfortable anywhere?
Fans often think that home advantage is because of their passion and commitment to the team. However, this might be a misunderstanding. Fans tend to remember the times when they cheered and a goal was scored, but they forget the times when they cheered and nothing happened.
One thing that does seem to be confirmed by science is that home fans direct a lot of their energy towards the referee. In an experiment, referees who listened to a recording of a match with crowd noise were less likely to make decisions against the home team than those who listened to a silent recording. This matches what happens in real matches.
Recent studies have looked at long-term trends in home advantage. They found that home advantage has decreased in many sports, but not as much as you might expect. One reason might be that travel is now easier and more comfortable for players. However, these changes don't fully explain why home advantage varies between sports.
For example, basketball is a sport where playing at home is very advantageous, while baseball is a sport where home advantage is less important. One possible reason is that team spirit is more important in team sports like basketball, and playing at home boosts this confidence. In individual sports like baseball, there may be less team spirit.
Another possibility is that home advantage is connected to a primitive urge to defend one's territory, like in the recent Rugby World Cup. Players' testosterone levels were higher before home matches, which might be related to this feeling of territoriality.
Overall, home advantage is a complex phenomenon that is still not fully understood."

Gary Player, a famous golfer, once said, ""The more I practice, the luckier I get."" However, he was being ironic, and what he really meant was, ""The more I practice, the better I get."" This quote has sparked a long-standing debate in the world of sports about whether talent is something you're born with or something you can develop through practice.
The idea that practice is more important than innate talent has been popularized by psychologist Anders Ericsson, who claims that with 10,000 hours of practice, anyone can become an expert in any field. This idea has been widely accepted, but some experts argue that it's not that simple.
The author of this book, Epstein, challenges the idea that practice is the only factor that determines success. He believes that there are many other factors at play, such as genetics, environment, support, and opportunity. He also argues that people's drive and determination can be influenced by their genes.
Epstein uses examples from different sports and activities to illustrate his points. For instance, he talks about the world's toughest sled dog race in Alaska, where the husky dogs' drive and desire to win seem to be just as important as their physical abilities. He also looks at the case of Usain Bolt, the fastest man in the world, and asks why we separate men and women in athletic competitions if practice is the only factor that matters.
The author concludes that the relationship between nature (genes) and nurture (environment) is complex, and that both are important for achieving success. He emphasizes that it's not just about how much you practice, but also about who you are and where you come from.

Here is a simplified version of the passage for a B2 learner:
A recent report says that many children in wealthy countries are unhappy and feel lonely. Jay Griffiths thinks she knows why: they are spending too much time indoors, staring at screens, and not enough time playing outside. She believes that this is the main problem. Many people agree with her. A study found that when asked what would make them happier, many children said they would like to spend more time outside. Even adults who are now over 40 often talk about how much fun they had as children, playing in the woods, swimming in rivers, and making dens in old sheds. However, they rarely stop to think that they are the ones who have created the safe, controlled environment that their own children now live in. 
Griffiths writes about how the fear of danger that parents have is linked to the toy and gadget industry, which wants to sell them things to keep their children entertained at home. She also criticizes the trend of prescribing medicine to calm children down or making them wear protective gear for playground games. While some of her ideas are interesting, Griffiths sometimes goes too far and ignores counterarguments. She is a romantic who idealizes children and thinks they are naturally adventurous and curious. However, this is not always true. Perhaps the most important idea in her book is that children should be allowed to make their own choices, take risks, and explore the world around them. Griffiths believes that children need to experience some danger to learn how to manage it. However, she does not explain how to achieve this. Some people might also wonder what about children who are naturally shy or cautious? Maybe the biggest mistake we make is forcing all children to fit into the same mold."

I'm a psychologist who has studied a lot. I'm good at solving problems, but that's not because of my education. Most problems in life can't be solved with formulas or memorized answers. They require common sense, experience, and creativity. Children learn these skills through play. As a researcher, I focus on the importance of play for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they're young. The more they have to learn, the more they play. Children play a lot more than other young animals because they have a lot to learn.
Play is a natural way for adults and animals to learn. Children need to learn important skills like creativity, getting along with others, and controlling their emotions through play. These skills can't be taught in school. They're learned by doing things on their own.
Creativity is important for success. We need people who can think creatively and solve new problems. The ability to think creatively comes from playing and being curious. Famous people like Albert Einstein, who developed the theory of relativity, said that they learned through play.
It's important for children to get along with others and work together. They learn this by playing with each other. Play is voluntary, which means they can stop if they want to. This makes play a democratic activity.
Unfortunately, school has become more stressful, and children have less time to play. Adults often intervene in children's play, which is not good for them. This is because of changes in society, such as parents being more worried about safety and the decline of neighborhoods. Our children don't need more school; they need more play. We should give them the freedom to play and explore, so they can grow into strong and capable adults."

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to look for work. Sites like Twitter and LinkedIn can help them connect with potential employers directly. However, this also means they can make mistakes. A young jobseeker in the US sent a message to a marketing executive on LinkedIn, asking for help finding a job. The executive had a large network of influential people, but she was not willing to share it with a stranger. She rejected the jobseeker's request and sent a harsh message that went viral. This incident highlights the importance of using social media correctly in a professional context. Many young people are getting it wrong.
When we were teenagers, social media was a place to escape from our parents and teachers. We used it to impress others, be someone we're not, and experiment with our online identities. However, this is not the same as using social media for professional networking. We need to understand that our online presence as teenagers is not relevant to our professional lives.
Some young people are still using the same approach they used in their teenage years, thinking that just because many people liked their posts on Facebook, they will be successful on LinkedIn. This is not the case. We need to be more professional and respectful when using social media for job hunting.
Employers often complain that young job seekers are too familiar and come across as arrogant on professional networking sites. This reinforces the stereotype that our generation is entitled. In reality, many of us are struggling to find work and are desperate to use social media to our advantage. To avoid this impression, we should introduce ourselves clearly, explain what we can offer, and be humble in our approach. By doing so, we can increase our chances of getting a positive response.
Social media can be a powerful tool for finding work, but we need to use it wisely to avoid making a bad impression."

Newspapers are in trouble. The number of people reading them has been falling since 2000. In the UK, most national dailies have lost between a third and half of their readers. In the US, a study shows that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26% of people, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people think that newspapers will disappear completely within 15 years. However, old forms of media have a habit of surviving. For example, books, theatre, and cinema have all continued to exist despite the rise of new technologies.
Newspapers themselves were once new and innovative, but it took a while for them to become the dominant way to get news. This was because it wasn't until the 19th century that it became possible to produce and distribute newspapers quickly and cheaply. People also had to get used to the idea that the world is constantly changing and that they need to stay informed about what's happening.
In the past, people didn't expect change or updates. They thought that life was cyclical and that the most important things were things that happened regularly, like the seasons. News was not a big part of people's daily lives until the 19th century.
Now, with the internet, people can get news whenever they want and from anywhere. They can also personalize their news and get updates in real-time. This is different from traditional newspapers, which had to be published regularly and had limited space. However, many news providers are not taking advantage of the internet's potential to help people understand the world better. Instead, they are focusing on being the first to break the news and getting people to comment. This can create more confusion than clarity.
In some ways, we are returning to the way news was spread in the past, where people would discuss what was happening in the marketplace or tavern. Newspapers have never been very good at explaining how the world works, and maybe they will disappear. Or maybe they will find a way to use the internet to guide us towards wisdom and understanding."

If humans were meant to live in the dark, we would be happy to do so. However, we are diurnal creatures, meaning we are most active during the day. Our eyes are adapted to the sun's light, not the moon's or stars'. This is a fundamental fact that is part of our nature. 
We have managed to control the night by adding artificial light. This is like building a dam to control a river. While it has its benefits, it also has negative effects, known as light pollution. This is mainly caused by bad lighting design, which allows light to shine upwards and outwards, rather than downwards where it is needed. This artificial light affects many living things, including us, and can alter their natural habits.
In the past, people didn't have the same problem with light pollution. Imagine walking through a city like London in the early 19th century, when it was the most populous city in the world. The only light came from candles, torches, and lanterns. From a distance, you would have smelled the city rather than seen it. 
We have lit up the night as if it were an empty space, but in reality, many species are nocturnal. Light can be very attractive to these animals, and it can even affect their behavior. For example, some birds are drawn to artificial light and can get trapped in it. 
Scientists used to think that light pollution only affected astronomers, who need a clear view of the night sky. However, we all need darkness to function properly. Without it, our internal clocks can become disrupted, leading to physical problems. The rhythm of our daily lives is closely linked to the rhythm of day and night. 
In a way, light pollution has cut us off from our natural heritage and our place in the universe. We have lost sight of our true size and scale, which is best appreciated in the darkness of night, with the Milky Way shining above us."

The founder of a big company has announced that they will no longer track their employees' holiday time. This decision was inspired by a similar policy at another company, an internet company with 2,000 employees. However, the two companies are very different. The internet company is small and has a simple service, while the big company has 50,000 employees and many different services, including finance, transport, and healthcare.
The idea is that employees can take as much holiday as they want, as long as they make sure it won't harm the business. But is this practical? It's hard to know for sure whether your absence would harm the business, especially in a big company with many different projects and employees. Even if you prepare well for your holiday, there will always be a lot of work to come back to. This can make people feel guilty and stressed, and they might not take holidays at all.
In the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, and this could lead to a ""no holiday"" culture if people feel they need to be available all the time. People might also feel uncomfortable taking holidays because they're worried about being seen as lazy. The policy could also lead to a sense of paralysis, where people don't take holidays or feel they need to use their statutory rights instead.
Technology has blurred the line between work and leisure time, making it harder to disconnect from work. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because they wanted to reconcile their new way of working with their old holiday policy. However, this could lead to a situation where employees feel like they're being monitored all the time, which can be stressful.
Employment law exists for a reason, and workers have the right to a minimum amount of paid annual leave. This is important for their mental and physical health. While the unlimited leave policy might increase morale, creativity, and productivity, it's not necessarily good for workers' well-being. I'm not sure if this policy is the right solution.

The process of reviewing scientific research papers by experts in the same field is considered a way to ensure the quality of published research. However, this process can be slow and may delay the publication of papers for up to a year. Some people think that this delay is worth it to ensure the trustworthiness of the published research. Others are concerned that the current system is flawed and that preprints (drafts of papers posted online without peer review) could be a better way to share research results.
Preprints have been around for 20 years, but they haven't been widely adopted. Some scientists are hesitant to use preprints because they worry that journals won't accept papers that have been posted online beforehand. Others are concerned that preprints could lead to the spread of ""junk science"". However, preprints are actually a way for authors to get feedback and criticism from experts worldwide, and they can be published in archives where readers can evaluate the arguments.
Preprints can also be useful for publishing negative results, which are an important part of the scientific process. In addition, preprints can increase the number of times a paper is read and cited by others. By using the internet and recalling the collaborative spirit of the scientific community, preprints can help refocus attention on the research itself, rather than where it is published.

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it's like a 'painting in words'. But this answer doesn't quite satisfy me or them. One day, I asked them to write two paragraphs about an object: one from a scientific perspective and one from the object's point of view, titled 'Poem'. One student wrote about an oxygen mask. This exercise helped us understand how poetry works in a unique way.
When I was in school, I didn't understand poetry. It seemed like a puzzle that got in the way of understanding and feeling. After school, poetry becomes less interesting to most people. Sometimes, you see a poem and it stands out because it's not like regular writing. It's like a challenge that makes you want to read it, but often you're disappointed or confused. But we still try to read it and appreciate it. What do we hope to find in poems? We want to find deep emotions, vivid images, and clever thoughts. But we can find these things in other forms of art, like films, books, or music. Poetry is special because it can be ambiguous, like everyday life. But what does it really mean to be a poem?
The dictionary defines a poem as a form of literary art that uses language and rhythm. But this definition doesn't explain what a poem is. The word 'poem' comes from the Greek word 'poí?ma', which means 'thing made'. So, what kind of thing is a poem? Some poets compare poems to wild animals or machines, but these comparisons don't really work. The most important thing is to think about what a poem is and what it means. This can help us see things in a new way and challenge our usual way of thinking. Poems can also get stuck in our heads, like song lyrics. But poems are different from other forms of writing because they are not created to sell or make money. They are special and unique."
