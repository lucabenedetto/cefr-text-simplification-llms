Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of sharing where you are on the internet. The website said that when you tell people where you are, you are also telling everyone else, not just your friends. This made people think about the risks of sharing too much on the internet.
The internet is like a big ocean, and we can share many things with many people. We can share our thoughts, photos, and stories. But sometimes we forget that what we say online can be seen by many people, not just our friends. This can lead to problems.
A long time ago, some brave people started sharing their lives online. They shared their thoughts, photos, and stories, just like we do today. They faced many problems, like losing their jobs or getting into trouble. But they learned from their experiences and taught us what to do.
One of these pioneers was a young man named Justin Hall. He started sharing his life online in 1994. He shared his thoughts, photos, and art. He even shared things that some people might not want to hear. But he did it in a way that was beautiful and interesting.
Justin's story is important because it shows us that sharing our lives online can be risky. We need to be careful about what we share and who we share it with. Another example is a woman named Heather Armstrong. She started a blog and shared her thoughts about her job. But someone found her blog and shared it with her boss, and she lost her job.
We need to remember that what we say online can affect our real lives. We should be careful and think about what we share before we share it."

A long time ago, some scientists were worried about a low-budget movie called What the Bleep Do We Know?. This movie talked about things we don't understand about the universe. The scientists thought the movie was not very good and was saying things that weren't true. But I watched the movie and didn't understand why it was so important at first. Then I saw some amazing things, like how water can be affected by our thoughts. Some people think this is very interesting, but scientists are not so sure. They want to see more proof before they believe it.
I know what the scientists mean. This idea is very exciting, but it's also very strange. It's like magic. But before we can believe it, we need to see more evidence. The movie didn't show enough proof, so scientists were not happy.
But the truth is, scientists are still learning many new things about the universe. They have found out that the universe is made of things we don't understand, like a special kind of matter and a mysterious force. They have also found out that our brains work in strange ways, and that our thoughts can affect our bodies. And they are still trying to understand how life began on Earth and how we are connected to the universe.
The scientists are not trying to know everything. They are just trying to learn more about the world and the universe. And what they are learning is that the universe is very, very strange and amazing."

I like writing short stories. It's easy and fun. Writing novels is harder. It's like planting a big forest, while writing short stories is like planting a small garden. Both are important to me. When I finish a novel, I like to write some short stories. When I finish some short stories, I want to write a novel. I never write short stories and a novel at the same time.
I started writing short stories in 1984. It was a little difficult at first, but it was fun. I liked the feeling of creating something new. My readers liked it too. One of my first short stories was called ""Breaking Waves"". It was part of a collection of stories called ""Tales from Abroad"".
I like writing short stories because they don't take a long time. It usually takes me a week to finish one. It's quick and easy. Writing novels takes a long time, sometimes a year or two. It's hard to keep going. Writing short stories helps me take a break.
I like that I can write short stories about anything, even a small idea or a picture in my mind. It's like improvising music. If the story doesn't work out, it's okay. I can try again. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver don't always write great short stories. I learn from my mistakes and use them to make my next story better.
Writing short stories helps me when I write novels. It's like a special place where I can try new things and learn. My short stories are like little memories I've left behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Writing short stories makes me happy because I can share my feelings with my readers."

Here is a simplified version of the passage for an A1 learner:
Science is very important. It helps us understand the world and make new discoveries. But it's not always easy. Sometimes scientists disagree with each other. They try to find new ideas and prove old ones wrong. This can be exciting, but it can also be confusing.
Science has changed a lot over time. In the past, people thought the Earth was flat. Then, scientists discovered that it's round. Later, they found out that the Earth goes around the Sun. This new information changed the way people thought about the world.
Science is not just about finding new facts. It's also about understanding how things work. Scientists try to figure out how the universe began and how it will end. They also try to understand how living things work, like plants and animals.
But science is not always perfect. Sometimes scientists make mistakes. They might think they know something, but later they find out they were wrong. This is okay, because it helps them learn and improve.
Science is important because it helps us make new things and solve problems. It can also help us understand the world better. But we need to be careful with science. We need to make sure it's used for good and not for bad.
Non-scientists, like you and me, need to pay attention to science. We need to understand what scientists are doing and how it might affect our lives. We can't just sit back and let scientists do all the work. We need to be involved and make sure science is used wisely.
I made the following changes to simplify the passage:
* Shortened sentences and paragraphs to make them easier to understand
* Removed complex vocabulary and phrases
* Used simpler sentence structures
* Added examples to help illustrate scientific concepts
* Emphasized the importance of science and its impact on our lives
* Removed the tone of criticism and skepticism to make the passage more positive and encouraging."

For a long time, people thought that ebooks would replace print books. But now, some big publishers are saying that ebook sales are not growing as much as they used to. One person in the publishing business even said that the excitement about ebooks might have been too much. They thought that ebooks would be very popular, but now they are not as sure.
Some people still think that ebooks will replace print books. But this is not true. Ebooks and print books can coexist. We use both in different ways.
The idea that one medium will replace another is not new. People have been saying this about new technologies for a long time. When TV came out, some people thought radio would stop being popular. But radio is still here and people still listen to it.
The same thing happened with books. When the phonograph came out, people thought books would disappear. But books are still here and people still read them.
We have strong feelings about new technologies. We like some things about them and we are scared of others. We also like to remember the old ways and we are afraid of losing things that are important to us.
When new technologies come out, we often think about the old ways and how they will change. We might feel sad that things are changing, but we also like to imagine what the future will be like.
The story about the death of the book is a common story that we tell ourselves. It helps us understand how we feel about change and new technologies."

Every day, I wake up early and write about how famous people from the past did their daily routines. I want to show how they found time to do their best work and be creative. I look at what they ate, when they slept and worked, and how they spent their time. This helps me understand their personalities and careers better.
I think that knowing what someone eats and when they take a nap can tell us a lot about who they are. This book is about how creative people do their work, not just the work itself. It's also about my own struggles to find time for my work and make a living.
I want to know how to do my best work and still have time for other things. Can I do all the things I want to do, or do I have to choose? I don't have all the answers, but I've tried to show how other successful people have solved these problems.
I wanted to write about people's daily routines because it can be ordinary and not very exciting. But it's actually very important for being creative and productive. A good routine can help us make the most of our time and energy.
I was inspired to write this book because I was procrastinating and started looking at how other writers work. I found it interesting and thought it would be fun to share with others. I collected information from many sources and tried to make it easy to read and understand.

Howard became a paleontologist because of a change in his family's plans when he was six years old. His dad had to cancel their holiday to Spain because of high interest rates. Instead, they went to the beach in England and Howard found a fossil on the sand. He knew from a young age that he wanted to be a paleontologist. When he finished university, he decided he wanted to study fossils from a long, long time ago. He didn't want to study the big, famous dinosaurs, but the small, old creatures that lived a long time ago. He worked hard on his thesis and then had to wait to see if he could get a job at a university. He applied for a job at Tavistock College in London and was surprised when he got it. He was happy to have the job and could finally do the work he loved. 
Later, Howard had a problem when someone stole his notes for a lecture he was going to give. He was very upset and had to cancel the lecture. He met a colleague who told him about a new collection of fossils at the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard was very interested and decided to go to the museum to study the fossils. He had to change his plans, but he was excited to have this new opportunity.

Charles Spence is a professor who studies how our senses work together to help us enjoy food. He thinks about things like the color, smell, and sound of food to make it taste better. He even eats unusual foods like ice cream made from bee larvae! 
He works with big food companies to help them make better food. He also helps famous chefs like Heston Blumenthal create new dishes that people will like. 
Did you know that the person who orders first at a restaurant usually likes their food the most? And did you know that people eat more food when they eat with friends? 
Charles Spence's lab is not fancy, but it's where he does his research. He works with cooks who can't fund their own research. He even helps big food companies make their food healthier by reducing salt and sugar. 
He's been working with Heston Blumenthal to create a dish that sounds like the sea. He also found out that music can affect how we taste food. For example, higher-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, and lower-pitched music makes it taste bitter. 
Charles Spence has a fun family. They like to have dinner parties with unusual foods and music. They even use tone generators and headphones to see how different sounds affect our taste.

Our brains are very busy. We have a lot of information coming at us from different places. We have to sort through it all and decide what's important and what we can ignore. We're doing more things on our own now. Thirty years ago, travel agents and salespeople helped us with things. Now we do them ourselves. We're doing many jobs at the same time, like checking our phones, watching TV, and working. But our brains are not good at doing many things at once. We think we're doing many things, but really we're just switching between them quickly. This is not good for our brains.
Our brains get tired and confused when we do many things at once. We might feel stressed and our brains might not work well. We can't focus on one thing for a long time. We get distracted easily. This is because our brains are not good at multitasking.
We also have a lot of emails and messages. We feel like we have to answer them, but it's hard to do that and get other things done. It's like trying to do too many things at once. This is making our brains tired and confused.

There is a chimpanzee in a Swedish zoo named Santino. He likes to break concrete into small pieces and throw them at visitors. Is he being mean? In some caves in the US, female bats help other bats who can't find the right way to have their babies. Are they being kind? 
A long time ago, people thought animals just did things without thinking about how they felt. But now, scientists are learning more about animal feelings and emotions. They are studying animals like bats, chimpanzees, rats, dolphins, and chickens. This has started a big debate. Can animals really think and feel like humans do? 
Some people think that animals can think and feel, and that we should treat them with kindness. Others think that animals are different from humans and that we should not compare them to us. 
There was an experiment with cows that had to open a gate to get food. The cows that opened the gate themselves seemed to be happy and excited. If cows like to solve problems, what does that mean for how we treat them? 
Some people think that we should stop eating meat because animals can think and feel. Others think that we should just learn more about animal thinking and feelings. 
It's hard to know for sure what animals think and feel, but it's an important question to think about."

'Critical thinking is a way to understand things better. We use it when we read or listen to something. Adrian West, a researcher, says that technology can help us learn, but it can also make it harder to think deeply. We are exposed to a lot of information, but it's not always good information. Sometimes, it's just someone's opinion or not true.
We are also reading less, and this might make us less good at thinking. A professor, Patricia Greenfield, says that we are reading less because we are spending more time watching TV and playing games. This can make it harder for us to think deeply.
Technology can be good or bad for thinking. For example, a computer game can help us think critically or make us think less. Reading on the internet can help us think, but following links can make it harder to think deeply.
The way we think has changed because of technology. Some people think that technology is bad for us, but others think it can be good. For example, some video games can help us learn and think better. They can teach us how to make decisions and think critically.
It's important to understand how technology affects our thinking and learning. We need to be careful and make sure we are using technology in a good way.'

Matthew Crawford is a writer and a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office, but he didn't like it. He likes working with his hands. His first book was about why manual work is good. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life. He wrote it because he noticed that advertisements pop up on his phone when he's waiting. He thinks this is a problem because we're not in control of what we think about.
We're being asked to pay attention to many things at the same time, and it's hard to focus. People are becoming less social because they're too busy with their phones. Crawford thinks this is a problem because we're losing the ability to have real conversations with each other.
He's not the only one who thinks this is a problem. Many people are worried about how our brains are changing. We're more aware of the things we could be doing, but we're not doing them. Crawford thinks this is because technology has given us too many choices, and we're not good at making decisions.
He thinks we need to find ways to focus on one thing at a time. He gives examples of people who have to use their judgment in their jobs, like cooks, hockey players, and motorbike racers. They have to pay attention to what they're doing and work with others. Crawford thinks this is important because it helps us appreciate the world around us and makes us better at paying attention to others.
It's not about becoming a chef or a hockey player, but about finding a way to use our judgment. When we focus on one thing, we can focus on what's important."

'What do you do for a living?' This is a common question we ask each other. But for someone like me, who is a philosopher, it's a bit tricky. When I say I'm a philosopher, some people might think I'm trying to say I'm special or know more than others. But that's not true. Philosophers are just people who think deeply about life and try to understand the world.
Philosophers have a special job. We think about big questions like 'What is the meaning of life?' or 'Is it right or wrong to do something?' Sometimes people think philosophers are too serious or too smart, and that's why they don't understand us. But really, philosophy is about thinking about the things that matter in our daily lives.
Some people think philosophers are only interested in big books and complicated ideas. But that's not true. Philosophy is about looking at the things we do every day and asking if they are really what we want to do. It's about being honest with ourselves and thinking about what is important.
I like to call myself an 'ethicist' because I think about what is right and wrong. But I think that's not enough. I want to talk about more than just rules and laws. I want to talk about how we think and feel, and how we can make good choices.
Philosophy can help us see things in a new way. It can help us think about our choices and make better decisions. And that's something we can all do, not just philosophers.'"

Food is important to many people. Philosophers have not always talked about food, but when they do, it is often just a way to explain other ideas. Epicurus, an ancient Greek philosopher, believed in enjoying life and avoiding pain. He talked about this in many areas of life, not just food and drink. Today, his name is often used to sell food and drinks.
Food is a big part of our lives. We eat with friends and family, and we share food with our community. Food comes from our history and culture. We learn about food from our families and friends.
Some people write about food and tell others what they like or dislike. But why do they get to decide what is good or bad? They are just better at describing what food tastes like. We should think about how our brains work when we taste food.
Food can be beautiful, like art or music. Some people think that food should be included in discussions about beauty, but it is hard to keep food around to look at or listen to again. Food is eaten and gone.
There are many questions about food, like what is good to eat and what is not. These questions show what we believe about the world. People who cook for a living have different responsibilities than people who cook at home. They have to think about their job and the food they make.
Food can help us understand other cultures. We can learn about new foods and make friends with people from different countries. This is important for building relationships and understanding each other.

Rob Daviau is a game designer from the US. He thought that traditional board games were not exciting or challenging enough. He wanted to create a new kind of game where players could make decisions that would affect the game in the future. He created a new version of the game Risk, called Risk Legacy. This game was special because players could make changes to the board and cards during the game. The game would change over time, and players would have to make new decisions based on what happened before.
Daviau worked with another game designer to create a new game called Pandemic Legacy. This game was very popular. He then created a new game called SeaFall. This game is set in the time of sailing ships and players have to explore the world. Daviau wanted to make sure that the game was exciting and challenging, so he tested it with many people.
Some people thought that the legacy format would not be popular, but it was a big success. Many players loved the idea of making decisions that would affect the game over time. One player, Russell Chapman, said that it was like a new level of excitement and challenge. Another player, Ben Hogg, said that it was like watching a TV series - you don't watch the same episode twice, you want to see what happens next.
The legacy format is special because it combines elements of video games and TV shows. It allows players to have a story that unfolds over time. Daviau thinks that the idea will soon get old, but others think it will continue to be popular."

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at a special place called the National Aquarium in New Zealand. He crawled across the floor and went into a small pipe that led to the ocean. This is a fun story that people liked to share online.
We like to imagine that animals are like us. This is called anthropomorphism. Octopuses are very smart, but they look very different from us. They can open jars, recognize faces, and even play. Some people think it's not good to imagine animals are like us, but Dr. de Waal, a scientist who studies animals, says it's actually the opposite. He thinks we don't want to believe that animals are smart like us.
Dr. de Waal looked at many studies about animal intelligence. He found that animals can do many things that we thought were only possible for humans. They can think about the past and the future, feel empathy, and understand what others are thinking. Animals are smarter than we thought.
A long time ago, people thought animals were smart and could even be put on trial for crimes. But in the 20th century, scientists started to think that animals were just machines that responded to rewards and punishments. This changed how people thought about animal intelligence. Now, Dr. de Waal thinks we are starting to understand that animals are intelligent in their own way.
The best way to test animal intelligence is to use tasks that are easy for them. For example, squirrels are great at remembering where they hide their nuts. If an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might ask us to change the color of our skin. We would probably fail!
Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really found a way to get to the ocean. But he thinks it's good that people are talking about animal intelligence. He even did an experiment with monkeys to see if they can feel envy. The monkeys got upset when they saw their friends getting better treats. The experiment was published in a scientific journal, but a short video clip really made people understand the results.

Robots are changing the way we work and live. They are becoming more common in many industries, not just in factories. Experts think that soon, robots will be used in many areas, and people's jobs will change. Some people think that robots will take over most jobs, but many people also think that their jobs will stay the same.
A company in Australia has made a robot that can lay bricks faster than humans. A robot in a supermarket checks that the shelves are full and the prices are correct. Some people think that robots will create new jobs for people who can fix and program them. Others worry that robots will make it hard for people to work with each other.
A expert on robots, Dr. Zhang, says that robots will change the way we work. He thinks that in a few years, many robots will be able to work with each other and with humans. He also thinks that some companies will need a special person to be in charge of robots. Dr. Zhang says that people who work with robots will need new skills.
In the future, robots will be used in our homes and will interact with us in new ways. This will be a big change, and we will need to make sure that it is safe and private. Education is important to help us understand and prepare for the changes that robots will bring.

Some people like to climb mountains. A long time ago, a man named George Mallory said that he wanted to climb Mount Everest because ""it's there"". This answer might inspire some people to try new things. Climbing can be fun and exciting, but it can also be very difficult and dangerous.
There are different ways to climb, and some people like to do it in a special way. For example, some people like to climb small rocks, while others like to climb big mountains. The way you climb depends on the type of climb you are doing.
Some people like to climb because it makes them feel free. But climbing can also be very confining, especially when you are stuck in a tent during a storm.
Some people think that climbing is in our nature. We are meant to challenge ourselves and take risks. Climbing can also help us develop good qualities like courage and respect for nature.
Climbers who do not use special equipment or help from others have to be very committed to their goal. This can make their achievements more special.
Climbing can also be a way to be in the moment and focus on the present. It's like a kind of meditation. Some people even think that climbing can help us find inner peace, just like the teachings of Zen philosophy.
When people ask why we climb, we can answer that it's because it's fun, it's a challenge, and it helps us grow as people."

When I was little, I thought gardens were always beautiful and special. My grandfather's garden was near a river and went down to the water. You couldn't reach the river, but you could hear the water and the birds singing in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this - a place to escape and be alone. My grandfather's garden wasn't special, but it was nice. He didn't have a big greenhouse like some of his neighbors. They used old windows to make theirs.
My father was a quiet person, but he liked to make people laugh. He had funny phrases he liked to use. He wasn't very ambitious and didn't like his job as a plumber. He was good at fixing things around the house, though.
We moved to a new house only once when I was a child. My mother liked to change the furniture, so it was always different. We got a piano once, but I was scared of it. It was too big and fancy. My sister got lessons, but I never got to play it.
I liked the river best. I could go there with my imagination and pretend I was in a different world. I would take a fishing net and walk along the riverbank, looking for fish. Sometimes I would take off my shoes and wade into the water.
I didn't like school very much, but my father said there was a job available for a gardener in the Parks Department. He thought I might like it. I like to think that deep down, he wanted me to be happy and good at something."

Rum gets a lot more rain than we do.""
We go down the hill to move his sheep. Lawrence tells me about the island. It's a special place with lots of grass and geese. The MacEwens have lived here for 3,000 years.
The sheepdog, Tie, is not doing a good job. He's supposed to circle around the sheep, but he's going straight through them. Lawrence is not happy. Tie looks sad.
The MacEwens own most of the island. Lawrence's wife, Jenny, helps him with the farm. Their son, Colin, runs the cottages, and their daughter, Mary, runs a hotel with her husband, Toby. They like that their boys can play outside and sail boats in the summer.
Life on the island can be hard. Sometimes there's no electricity, so we have to use torches. There's no mobile phone signal, so we can't use our phones. But we like it here.
One day, some musicians come to the island and play music in the tearoom. Everyone loves it. That night, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. He says her father bought a farm on another island without looking at it, and Jenny was sent to manage it. She didn't know much about farming, but she was good at typing.
I go to bed and wake up to more rain. But I eat well because all the food comes from the island. I go to the fisherman, Sandy, to get fresh fish and bring it back to Mary at the hotel. We eat it for dinner. The next day, I take the ferry to my next island. I was worried that the ferry might not come because of the bad weather, but it did. I'm glad to be leaving, but I also like it here."

The video game industry is growing. It used to be hard to get a job in this industry because people thought it was just for young people who liked playing games. But now, experts say it's a serious job. To get into this industry, you need to be good at making games. You don't need a degree in computer science, but you do need to make games. It's like any other creative job - you need to be good at what you do.
Jim Donelly, a person who writes about games, says it's hard to get a job in a big company, but there are still opportunities. You can start by making games on your own and then try to get a job. Another expert, John Field, says that to be successful in this industry, you need to be good at making games, have the right skills, and be creative. He also says that having a good course or training can help.
To get ahead in this industry, you need to network and make connections. This means meeting other people who work in the industry and learning from them. The video game industry is growing and becoming more popular. More and more people are playing games on their phones and computers. John thinks that this is a good thing because it means there are more opportunities for people who want to work in the industry.

Sometimes, having a lot of money can be a problem. I help my parents, but they don't want to be dependent on me. After I stop playing, I want to take a break and do things I haven't had time for.

There was a problem with the computer system, and the line wasn't moving. People were getting angry and frustrated. Violet was feeling anxious and thought about leaving. She also realized she had lost her phone, which was very annoying. 
She couldn't call her son Harry to ask him to help her find her phone because his number was on her lost phone. She asked a kind couple behind her if she could use their phone to call Harry. 
Finally, the line started moving, and Violet got to the front. She gave her papers to the staff and went on the ship. The ship's lobby was big and fancy, with shiny wood and lots of mirrors. Violet was squished in the elevator with many other people, but at last she reached her room. She was relieved to see that it had a balcony, just like she had asked for. She had been worried about this, and now she could relax."

Eleanor Catton is a young writer. She wrote a big book called The Luminaries. It's a murder mystery set in New Zealand a long time ago. The story is very complicated. Eleanor wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a big part in the story.
I met Eleanor in the UK. She was very calm, even though she was in the middle of a big publicity storm. She told me a funny story about being stopped at the airport and asked to show her passport. She showed the official her book and said it was a book about a mystery. The official asked what it was about, and Eleanor said it was hard to explain.
Eleanor said she didn't plan the book's structure beforehand. She just wrote and saw where it took her. She wanted to make the book fun to read and exciting. She likes writing about New Zealand and its landscape. She said that being in a different place can change her imagination.
Eleanor is happy to be successful at a young age. She said it's nice to have people in her home country feel proud of her. She's not sure if she'll write another book like this one, but she's happy to keep writing.

Jonny Kinkead likes to make things with his hands. When he was a boy, he used to play with a guitar in his dad's garage. Now, he makes his own guitars by hand. He loves making guitars because he can create a beautiful sound with just two pieces of wood.
Jonny learned to play the guitar when he was 11. He then wanted to learn the bass guitar. Instead of buying one, he decided to make his own. He studied guitars and learned how to use different types of wood to make different sounds.
Jonny and his brothers used to make model boats and airplanes when they were young. Their dad taught them how to use tools like saws and chisels. Jonny also fixed and customized instruments for his friends.
After school, Jonny studied architecture at university. But he didn't like it and dropped out. He realized that he wanted to make guitars, not buildings. He thought that building guitars was like sculpting, but instead of making art, he was making something people could use.
Jonny started making guitars for a living. At first, he sold them for the cost of the materials. But as he became famous for making good guitars, he could charge more money. Now, he still makes only a few guitars a year, which isn't very much money. He says that he's still ""scratching a living"".
Jonny thinks that it's easier for new guitar-makers today because people now know that UK-made guitars are good. He says that you can learn by taking classes, but you also need to try things and make mistakes to get better."

Talking about the weather is a common way to start a conversation in English. Many people think that English people love talking about the weather because it's interesting. But, it's not really about the weather. It's a way to make conversation and be friendly. 
For example, when we say ""Nice day, isn't it?"" or ""Ooh, isn't it cold?"", we're not really asking about the weather. We're just saying hello or trying to make conversation. This is like when monkeys and apes groom each other to be friendly. 
We only talk about the weather in certain situations. We might say something about the weather when we meet someone, to start a conversation. We might also talk about the weather when we're not sure what else to say. This can make it seem like we talk about the weather all the time. But, really, it's just a way to be friendly and make conversation."

Two brothers, Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, are famous for being good at triathlons. They decided to take part in a special race to help raise money for charity. The race was between a car and a bike. Jonny drove the car, and Alistair rode a mountain bike. They started at a beautiful lake and had to finish at the highest road in Yorkshire.
Jonny was excited to drive, but Alistair was confident because he knew his brother's driving skills. Alistair wore special clothes to keep warm because it was cold. The race began, and they went their separate ways. Jonny had to drive on the road, while Alistair rode his bike through the countryside.
The road was not easy for Jonny. He had to stop because of a big tractor. Alistair had a hard time too. He had to carry his bike up a big hill. But he didn't give up. He kept going and finally reached the top.
Then, he rode down the hill and rode to the finish line. Jonny was still driving. He had to go through a small village and then a stream. He was getting close to the finish line. Alistair was already there, waiting. He was happy to have won.
Jonny was disappointed, but he was proud of his brother. He said, ""Well done, Alistair. I'm gutted."""

When I play tennis on Centre Court at Wimbledon, I feel a strange quietness. The ball bounces softly on the grass, and I hear the sound of my own shots. The grass is trimmed, the stadium is old, and the players wear white clothes. The crowd is quiet too. This quiet helps me focus on the game. 
What I struggle with most in a tennis match is to forget everything and just think about the game. The quiet of Centre Court helps me do that. Sometimes, when a point is finished, the crowd cheers and claps. I hear it, but it feels far away. I'm so focused that I don't think about the millions of people watching me on TV.
I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My coach, my uncle Toni, told me it was the biggest tournament. When I was 14, I thought about playing there and winning. Before 2008, I played and lost twice to Roger Federer. Losing is hard, but losing when you have a chance is even harder. I was very sad after my loss in 2007. I cried for a long time. My coach told me not to cry and that there would be more chances.
I want to make the most of my time as a tennis player. Every moment counts, and some moments are more important than others. I didn't want to miss another chance like that. This year, 2008, I was more focused. I knew I could win. The night before the final, we didn't talk about the match at dinner. I was already thinking about the game in my head. From now on, I wanted to keep my thoughts to myself."

'A long time ago, a young English woman named Jane Goodall went to Africa. She was very excited to be there. She wanted to learn about animals and help them. Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became famous for her work with chimpanzees. She wrote many books and made TV shows about her discoveries.
Before Jane's work, people didn't know much about chimpanzees. They thought they were just wild animals that didn't care about each other. But Jane showed that chimpanzees are smart, social, and emotional, just like humans. They use tools, eat meat, and have their own families.
Jane's work was very important. She helped us understand animals better and changed the way we think about ourselves. She was a pioneer in her field and is still famous today. Even as a little girl, Jane was curious and loved animals. When she was five years old, she snuck into a henhouse to see how hens lay eggs. This might have been the start of her career as a biologist.'

Many people ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a dream job that some people have when they are young, like being a racing car driver. But most people grow up and choose more realistic jobs, like being a lawyer or a car parts maker. It seems silly to think that you can make a living by drawing simple pictures, but some people do it. 
I became a cartoonist because I loved drawing and making comics when I was a child. I studied graphic design in college and then showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted my cartoons. I started drawing and soon I was making enough money to support myself.
To become a cartoonist, you don't need a university degree, a lot of money, or even be very good at drawing. You just need your brain, your hands, and something to draw with. But it's not an easy job. You need to be very good at your work and have a lot of patience.
I have done many different types of cartoons, like political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I have also been a writer, a caricaturist, and a designer. I don't say no to any job because you can learn a lot from any work you do. It's also important to be smart, read a lot, and be curious about the world.
Most cartoonists today have to sell their own work. They need to be good at business too. I have seen many cartoonists who are not very good at drawing but are very good at business do well. It's important to not worry too much about someone stealing your ideas. You can protect your work by putting a 'c' for 'copyright' on it.
It's more likely that no one will be interested in your work, but if someone does steal it and it becomes popular, it can be a good thing!"

Twenty years ago, I moved to a new house. I decided to throw away some old things, including an electric guitar my dad gave me for my 16th birthday. I felt bad about getting rid of it, but I did it anyway. Then, a young man saw me throwing it away and asked if he could have it. I said yes, and we parted ways.
Later, I got an email from a man named Keith. He said he had my guitar and wanted to sell it back to me. He found my name on a sticker on the guitar. I was very happy to get my guitar back. My dad used to put stickers with my name on everything I had, even my guitar.
When I was a teenager, my parents wanted me to play the classical guitar. But I didn't like it, so I started playing the electric guitar instead. It was fun, but I didn't play it much.
Recently, Keith sent me the guitar, and I was very happy to see it again. When I picked it up, I remembered my birthday when my parents gave it to me. It felt smooth and comfortable in my hands. I started playing it, and my fingers knew what to do. I even felt the special pain of pressing the strings to play a chord.
The electric guitar is a fun instrument, but it's not good for playing alone. Maybe I'll start a band with my son, who plays the saxophone. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!

There's a lot of talk about sleep now. When I wrote a book about people who can't sleep, I felt like I was warning people about the dangers of not sleeping enough. Sleep is very important for our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important it is.
But what about dreams? We don't hear much about dreams. When we wake up early, we often cut off the last hour or two of sleep. This is the stage of sleep where we have our most vivid dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time dreaming. When we don't get enough sleep, our brains make up for it by having more dreams the next night.
Some scientists think dreams are important. They used to think that dreams helped us understand our minds, but now they think they might be more important for our brains. A study found that people who are creative, like actors and writers, have better memories of their dreams. This makes sense because they use their dreams to help them come up with new ideas.
But dreams are not just for artists. We all need to be creative in our daily lives. We need to think clearly and come up with new ideas. Dreams can help us do this. Even a bad dream can help us think more clearly. When I wake up from a good dream, I can write very easily. My words and ideas come quickly and easily. We all need to dream to be able to think clearly and be creative."

There are also pictures of her two daughters smiling at you. Susie is a very good artist. She can copy famous paintings from a long time ago. People think her copies are the real thing! She has been doing this for 30 years. Susie has copied paintings by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh.
Susie's copies are very good because she takes her time. She makes sure they look like the original paintings. Some people buy her copies for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how long she takes to finish it. Susie won't say who her clients are, but they are galleries and collectors. Some collectors like to show off their art to their friends. Susie says it's okay if they do this, but she doesn't want to pretend her copies are the real thing.
Susie started as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She drew pictures of plants for a long time. This helped her learn to be very accurate. She says this was good training for what she does now. She also learned to draw plants and make perfect copies of old paintings. Susie now specializes in copying French impressionist paintings. She likes the artists Manet, Cezanne, and Degas.
Some people might think it's strange that Susie doesn't make her own paintings. They might think art is about expressing yourself. But Susie says she has spent years learning and practicing. She makes a good living doing what she does. She has tried making her own paintings, but they didn't turn out as well as her copies. Maybe it's like eating food cooked by a good chef after eating plain bread and water for a long time. The thing about Susie is that she is very good at what she does."

'When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's likely they're listening to pop music, not classical music. Most people know many pop groups, but few know who Brahms was. I'm studying music, but my friends and I don't know much about classical music. People don't buy many classical music recordings. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music. Why don't teenagers like classical music? It's hard to understand because classical music is slow and has many changes in mood. Teenagers like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Pop music is easy to listen to and has simple structures. Classical music needs time and attention. Pop music is about things that teenagers care about. We listen to music differently now. We can find any music on the internet. We don't often hear classical music. My teacher says classical concert audiences are growing, but I think most of those people are not teenagers. When I play classical music with my friends, we see mostly old people. Some people think schools are the problem, but many kids enjoy playing classical music in school.

I saw a boy on the other side of the river. He was trying to stand on the ice. I didn't know him. I put on my special clothes for kayaking and grabbed my jacket. I checked my pocket for a special chain my grandfather gave me. It's very special because only a few people know about it.

""The TV show 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live in a house. They take things from the big people who live there. I directed the TV show. It was hard to make it because people who love the book have strong ideas about how it should be. I used the drawings from the book to help me. The author wanted the show to be from the tiny people's point of view, not from the big people's. This made filming more difficult.
The tiny people are 10 times smaller than the big people. So, when we filmed them walking or doing things, we had to be 10 times farther away. When we filmed the big people's things, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from low down. We never raised the camera high except for some special shots.
It was hard to get the shadows right when we combined the tiny people with the big people's surroundings. We developed a special way to do it. After the show was finished, a famous director, George Lucas, called me to ask how we did it.
The only big set we built was the tiny people's home under the floorboards. It was filled with big things to make the actors look small. The actors had to carry big things like scissors and coins. Sometimes we had to stop filming because it was too funny.
In one scene, the tiny people go down a drain. The actors had to be swept down a tunnel with water and they said it was very scary. They didn't have to act much because they were really scared!
I wanted the costumes to be right. I made them out of heavy material so they looked like doll clothes. This made it hard for the actors to move around. They couldn't sit down or take off their clothes because they were sewn in.
The weather was very hot during filming. I think the actors didn't thank me for the costumes!
Most of the scenes were filmed with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I drew pictures of each scene myself to show the actors what it should look like. I drew 2,000 pictures in the end! The budget didn't allow for special effects studios, so I worked at night for three months. We had to work fast and make mistakes sometimes. But it all worked out in the end, and I think the show was successful in showing the magic of the books."""

Many American teenage girls are expected to be good students, work part-time, and help others. They must do well in school and have a job. Teenagers can't just go to school and do nothing. They must work hard and be good at everything. Some people think that teenagers are lazy and only care about themselves. But this is not true.
Teenagers have a lot of work to do. They have homework, tests, and other activities. They also have jobs and help at home. They must also have a social life. It's hard for them to have time for everything.
Some people think that teenagers spend too much time on their phones. But many teenagers use their phones to help them with their work and to stay in touch with their families. They can do their homework anywhere and anytime.
Teenagers often don't get enough sleep. They might sleep only 6-7 hours a night. This can make them tired and grumpy. Some teenagers even fall asleep in school because they are so tired.
Despite all their work and responsibilities, many teenagers still find time to help others. They volunteer and do things to make their community better. They are not selfish and only think about themselves. They care about others and want to make a difference.
In the future, people might think differently about teenagers. They might see that they are not lazy or selfish, but hardworking and caring people who make a difference in the world."

There is a special group of teenagers who live near a town called Bishop in the US. They like to send balloons to space. They do this to learn about science and have an adventure. One weekend, I went to join them. They were going to send a balloon to the edge of space to see shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when small rocks or pieces of metal from space enter the Earth's atmosphere and make a bright trail.
The teenagers prepared the balloon by putting a special box on the bottom. Inside the box, they put a camera, a tool to measure how high the balloon was, and a thermometer to measure the temperature. They also put two GPS trackers on the outside so they could find the box later.
They used a special gas to make the balloon get bigger and bigger. It took a long time to get the gas, but it was worth it. When it was time to send the balloon, they counted down and let it go. The balloon went up, up, up, and some of the teenagers followed it with flashlights to see where it went.
After the balloon disappeared, the teenagers went home, but some stayed to look for shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the side of a mountain and looked at the very clear sky. It was hard to believe they were only a few hours from a big city.
The next day, the teenagers went to find the box using the GPS trackers. It took them a long time to get to it, but it was an adventure. The box was in a special place, high on a rock near a waterfall. They didn't find any shooting stars, but they learned a lot about science and had a great story to tell."

Chloe Morgan didn't like science when she was young. But then she saw an article about dinosaurs and it changed everything. She wanted to learn more.
Chloe's brother was into dinosaurs when he was young, but she didn't share his interest. One day, she helped him with a science project and saw an article about dinosaurs. It was amazing! She wanted to learn more.
Chloe met a famous palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was nice and easy to talk to. He was patient and listened to her questions. This made her feel comfortable.
People often think palaeontologists are weird or not good with people. But Chloe's job is not like that. She digs up dinosaur bones, studies them in the lab, and writes about them. She also talks to people about science.
Chloe likes to explain science to others, especially children. She thinks it's important to tell them about all kinds of science, not just dinosaurs. Dinosaurs can help kids learn about the natural world and other sciences.
Chloe was in a TV show about dinosaurs called ""Walking with Dinosaurs"". She helped make sure the dinosaurs looked right. She's happy that people of all ages watched the show and learned about dinosaurs.
Chloe thinks people like dinosaurs because they're exciting and new. We can learn a lot from them. Dinosaurs take us back in time and remind us that there's still a lot to discover.

When you go on a car trip with your family, you know you're not there yet, even when you ask 'Are we there yet?' many times. When you finally get there, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here'. So, you should ask 'Are we here yet?' instead. Mums and dads get tired of answering 'Are we there yet?' many times. They wish they could relax and enjoy the trip. 
Imagine being in the back seat, watching movies, listening to music, or playing with puzzles while looking out the window at the nice views. The person sitting next to you, usually your mum or dad, helps you with things like getting you a drink or adjusting the radio. 
Sometimes, someone in the back seat does something naughty, like putting their foot on your side of the seat. This can start a fight. The driver and co-pilot try to stop the fight and tell the naughty person to stay in their own seat. 
After a while, the car ride gets calm again, and you might even get to read a book. But then, you might feel a cold breeze on your arm. This is because your sibling is blowing air on you on purpose. You get angry and yell at them. The grown-ups try to make you stop fighting and stay in your seat. 
Dad has a trick to make the kids quiet. He says, 'We're there!' and we get out of the car. But sometimes, you can tell when you're really 'there' because the grown-ups run away from the kids as fast as they can. So, if the grown-ups are still near, the answer is 'no, you're not there yet.'"

John and Zuzi Morgan have a special café in Oxford where people can play board games and have a cup of coffee and cake. They want people to have fun and want to come back again. Zuzi says they wanted to create a place where people can be together, not just staring at their phones. They like games that are not too complicated and are fun for everyone.
The games they play are called 'Eurogames'. They are about things like farming and building. The first game was called The Settlers of Catan. Players work together and trade things with each other. This makes everyone feel included and excited.
Another game, Pandemic, is about working together to solve problems. The designer, Matt Leacock, was inspired by a game called Lord of the Rings. He wanted to create a game that would make everyone feel good, whether they won or lost.
Matt Leacock loves board games because he was frustrated with them when he was a child. He would try to design his own games with his uncle. Pandemic was very successful and has many fans.
The growth of video games has actually helped board games become more popular. Many people play games on their phones, and this has made them more open to playing board games too. John and Zuzi's café is very popular, and people enjoy playing games together in the same room.
In our modern world, where people often play games online, tabletop gaming has become a way to be together and have fun in the real world."

Tony Connor is a famous person who does cool bike tricks on the internet. He is a street trials cyclist, which means he jumps from one hard-to-reach place to another on his bike. People watch his videos online and like him a lot.
I met Tony at a special bike park on a Saturday morning. Many kids and even older people knew who he was and came to say hi. They thought he was amazing. I was surprised too when I saw him do some tricks. He's very brave and creative.
Tony doesn't like being famous, though. He prefers to do his tricks instead of talking about them. He says it's hard for him to be nice to everyone who likes his videos. He likes to focus on his bike skills instead.
Tony thinks it's great that technology lets him make a living doing what he loves. But he also thinks it's weird that everyone is always taking pictures or looking at their phones. He likes to do things, not just watch others do them.
Tony is not a reckless person. He takes advice from experts to make sure he's safe. He knows that some people might think he's taking too many risks, but he says they don't understand the sport. He's just someone who feels scared, but he finds a way to overcome it. He plans carefully and prepares well before trying new tricks.

Helen Skelton is a TV presenter who does many exciting challenges for charity. She has run a long way in the desert and gone on a small boat trip down a big river. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a thin wire high above the ground. The wire was 66 meters up, and there was no safety net. She held onto a long stick to help her balance. Helen took lessons from a professional wire walker. She already knew some circus skills, but she found out that walking on a wire is very different. 
""It was a big surprise,"" Helen said. ""I didn't know how strong I would need to be. Every day, I would run up a big hill, then do exercises, and then practice walking on the wire. I also learned how to fall safely if I slipped. It hurt every time I fell, but I had to stay positive. If I was scared and shaking, the wire would shake too!"" 
The day of the challenge was windy, but Helen took deep breaths and walked slowly along the wire. It took her 15 minutes to walk the 150 meters. ""That was the scariest thing I've ever done,"" Helen said afterwards. ""I'm glad it's over!"" Helen is already planning her next charity project: to go to the South Pole by skiing, kite, and bike."

Jeff Somers had a big dream. He wanted to travel around the world on a special bike called a penny farthing. It's an old-fashioned bike with one big wheel and one small wheel. Jeff had already traveled in a car and loved racing cars. He even built racing car engines. He used to ride his bike to work and to visit Amsterdam on holiday.
Jeff's trip to Amsterdam opened his eyes. He thought, ""I want to see the world by bike!"" But he didn't want a normal bike. He wanted to build his own special bike. He looked at old penny farthings in a museum to learn how to make one.
Jeff tried to start his trip twice before, but he had to stop because of a hurt knee. Finally, in 2006, he set off. He traveled to 23 countries on four continents for three years. The best part was when he saw Mount Everest in Tibet. People were amazed by his special bike.
The worst part was when Jeff got sick from drinking dirty water from a stream. He was in a hostel bed for 10 days without medicine. He didn't have money for a doctor or to go home. But Jeff says he would travel again tomorrow if he could afford it."

I work at a university in the United States. My team and I are studying water birds, especially the American black duck. We have a new tool called a 'night-vision scope' that helps us see the ducks at night. We're worried about the black ducks because their numbers are very low. We don't know if they have enough food on the east coast.
We know a lot about what they do during the day, but not at night. The new scope will help us see them clearly at night, even on dark nights. This will help us make better decisions about where they live.
It's hard work. We work four people, each working six hours a day. We have to go to different places and take notes about the ducks we see. The weather is not good - sometimes it's cold and wet. I need a lot of coffee to stay awake!
We haven't missed many days, except one when it was too snowy. I like this job because it's a challenge. In the summer, we'll work in a laboratory, looking at our results together. It will be hard to stay inside, but it's important to do this work. I wouldn't change it for anything!

I get small samples from our factory every week and I check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the things we use to make the chocolate, like nuts and fruit. I choose the best ones to put in the chocolate. I have a special kitchen at work where I can test and taste the chocolate. I like to share it with my colleagues and make them happy. My kitchen has machines and ingredients to play with. It's nice to have a quiet space to go to during the day. Every day is different in my job. Sometimes I work in the lab and sometimes I go to other countries to buy things we need. This job is not boring because it's always different. The only thing I don't like is when I have to be away from my family. But I love my job and I love chocolate!"

Do you want to learn circus skills? Sophia Grayson teaches circus skills to young people at Circus Experience. She says her course is popular because it teaches many skills, like juggling, throwing and catching balls, and flying through the air on a trapeze. On the course, students learn new things each time and parents can come to watch. Sophia says to be a good circus performer, you need to keep practicing and trying new things. It's also important to be friends with other performers and learn from them. You need to be fit and train every day to stay strong. Sophia says the best performers are those who want to be the best and never stop learning. Some people think circus performers get hurt or only work for a short time, but Sophia says that's not true. The real challenge is thinking about the future because you can only perform on the road when you're young. The course also teaches how to plan a business. Many students who finished the course started their own businesses and are happy to share their stories. Sophia warns that being a circus performer is not a way to make a lot of money, but it's a fun job.

Some people think that people who sing in the background aren't good enough to be the main singer. But that's not true! They have to be very good. Mariam is a real star in the music world!
""I love my job because I never know what I'll be asked to sing,"" she says. ""It could be a classical song, a jazz song, a hip-hop song, or a funny song for the radio or a commercial. Sometimes producers ask me to do something strange, like singing like a fish in the water! But I don't argue, I just do my job.""
To be good at my job, I need to have good musical skills and be able to learn quickly. Sometimes there's no paper with the music on it, so I have to remember everything. I remember my first time recording music for a movie. It was very hard because there were eight of us singing different songs, and an orchestra too! I was very nervous because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again. That's not fun.
One of my favorite jobs is helping songwriters. New songwriters don't always know what kind of music sounds good with a woman's voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to make it better."

We helped the elephants by collecting their food. Elephants eat a lot of grass and bananas. It was hard work, but it was worth it to see the elephants happy. We also washed the elephants in the river. I had fun, even though I got wet! In the evening, we walked the elephants to a special place where they sleep.

In the summer, I focus on training and studying when there's no snow. It's nice to have a break from a strict diet and to spend time with my friends. I think about my future and what I want to do. Snowboarding is very important to me, but I also think it's good to have something else to do in case I can't snowboard anymore or get hurt. Maybe I can become a doctor one day. It's hard to imagine not loving snowboarding, but I know I can't do it forever.

My name is Tom. I am 15 years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My father got a job to take care of the castle. He is very happy because it's a great opportunity. But my family and I were worried about living on the island. We didn't know what it would be like. We thought it might not be as comfortable as our old home. There is no school on the island, so I have to go to school on the mainland every day. I take a boat to get there.
The castle is not very beautiful, but our apartment is cozy. In the summer, many people visit the island, and we have parties on the beach. In the winter, it's quieter, and we only see our neighbors. They are very nice, and we help each other with things. The biggest change for me is traveling to school every day. Sometimes I miss the last ferry home, and I have to wait until the next one. But sometimes the views are amazing, like when the sun sets over the sea. Sometimes it's foggy, but then the sun comes out again. We also have big storms, and I worry about the castle. But it's been here for a long time, and it's still standing.

My parents taught me how to tell the difference between birds and find good places to see them. It was amazing! After that, I joined a birdwatching club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different kinds of birds. I've seen many birds on family holidays in other countries. We look for places where we can see birds together. I went to Egypt and South America last summer. I didn't see my 200th bird, but it's okay. I learned that you need to be patient when watching birds. I made a video about my challenge and many people liked it. My teachers asked me to tell the school about birdwatching. I was a little nervous, but I did it! I think it's lucky to live in the countryside. There are many birds to see, even in cities with parks. I think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people to join. Everyone should connect with nature, and it doesn't have to be expensive.

I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would run home from school to play with other kids. I loved it! I got better and better, and my family thought I might keep playing it. And I did! I even dreamed of playing football when I grew up. When I was 13, a referee saw me play and thought I was good. He told the manager of a big football club, and she asked me to join her team. I was surprised because I didn't know girls could play in women's clubs. But the manager was happy with me, and I started training with the big club. I got better and better. Sometimes people didn't think I would be a good player, but my coach said, ""Just be yourself and believe in yourself."" He even let me play in a big match when I was younger than usual. I was so happy when we won, and my coach was cheering me on. Since then, I've scored many winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament to encourage teenagers to play football. We want them to see what it's like to play for a big team and to believe they can do it if they work hard. My advice is to have fun, but also be prepared for tough times.

Research is important for students. It's not just for famous professors or scientists. Research is a way to learn and grow. It's a way to ask questions and find answers. You don't just repeat what you learn, you make new knowledge. 
Research is like asking ""Why?"", ""How?"", ""What if?"", and ""Why does it matter?"". It's a way to think about the world and make it better. 
You are already a researcher. You do research every day, even when you're not in school. You ask questions and find answers to solve problems. 
In school, you will learn to ask questions, explore, and think critically. You will learn to find answers and make new knowledge. It's okay to question what you learn and not just accept it. You need to think about it and make sure it's true.
Remember, research is important because it helps us learn and grow. It's not just for experts, it's for everyone."

Cities have been important places for learning and thinking for a long time. In the past, people went to coffee shops in London to talk about science and politics. In Paris, artists like Pablo Picasso liked to discuss art in cafes. But city life can be difficult. The same coffee shops that helped people talk also spread diseases. Picasso eventually left the city to live in the countryside.
Scientists are now studying how cities affect our brains. They have found that cities can make our brains work less well. One reason is that cities are very different from nature. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their hospital windows get better faster. Even just looking at nature for a little while can help our brains work better.
Most people now live in cities. We don't live in big open spaces like we used to. Instead, we live in busy cities with many people. This can affect our health and how we think. When we walk in a city, our brains have to work hard to pay attention to everything around us. This can be tiring.
Scientists have found that cities are too full of things that demand our attention. Our brains need to work hard to ignore some things and focus on others. This takes a lot of energy. Natural places don't require as much effort. This is called attention restoration theory.
Philosophers and architects have been warning about the effects of cities for a long time. They think that we need to find ways to bring nature into our cities. Parks and gardens can help us relax and improve our brains.
Some scientists have found that the same things that make cities hard to live in also make them creative. The crowded streets and many people can inspire new ideas. So, we need to find a way to make cities work better for our brains while keeping their benefits.

Where do we find the mind? We usually think it's inside our heads. But maybe we should look outside too. Many things, like stones, tools, and writing, help us think and learn. 
We often study the mind by taking people away from their usual things and surroundings. This helps us learn about the brain, but it's not the whole story. The mind is not just in our brain. It's also in the things around us. 
I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). It says that things can help us think and learn. For example, when we use a stick, it becomes a part of us. We use things to help us understand the world and to make new things. 
The human mind is like a project that keeps changing and growing. We use things to make sense of the world and to make new discoveries. This is why humans make things, and those things help make our minds what they are. I call this ""metaplasticity"". 
We should remember that our minds are connected to the things around us. MET helps us understand how different things, from old stones to modern phones, have helped us think and learn. We have been using technology to change our minds since we first evolved."

Photography is a very important invention that has changed the way we live and see the world. In the United States, photography became a big part of American culture very quickly. It was used in many different ways, from taking pictures for practical purposes to making art and entertainment.
People liked photography because it was a new and exciting technology. It made it possible to capture and share images of the world around us. Photography also helped people to show who they are and what they look like. It was a way to share memories and tell stories.
Photographs are special because they are made by machines, so they are like a record of what was in front of the camera. But they can also be personal and show the photographer's point of view. This makes photography a unique way to communicate.
Photographs can have different meanings depending on where and how they are seen. They can be used to tell a story, make people laugh, or show something important. Some artists use photographs in their work, and photography has become an important part of art.

Psychology is the study of our thoughts, feelings, and actions. It's like trying to understand how our minds work. William James, a famous philosopher, said that psychology is the'science of mental life'. This means that psychology helps us understand how we think, feel, and behave.
We all have our own thoughts and feelings, and we can't always know what others are thinking or feeling. This makes it hard to understand each other. Psychologists try to figure out what makes us tick by studying our behavior and making educated guesses about what's going on inside our heads.
It's like trying to solve a puzzle. Psychologists gather clues by observing people's behavior and then use those clues to make educated guesses about what's happening inside their minds. They also use scientific methods to make sure their guesses are correct.
Psychology is important because it can help us understand ourselves and others better. It can also help us develop new ways to teach children to read, design safer machines, and help people who are feeling sad or upset.
In the past, psychologists used to try to understand the mind by thinking about their own thoughts and feelings. But this method has its limitations. Today, psychologists prefer to study people's behavior and use that information to make educated guesses about what's going on inside their minds.

There is a special place in the United States where they keep old products that nobody wanted to buy. It's called the Museum of Failed Products. The museum has many strange things like a shampoo called A Touch of Yogurt and a cola called Breakfast Cola. The person who owns the museum, Carol Sherry, thinks that each product has a sad story behind it. 
The museum is special because it's a successful business. Many people visit the museum every week. You might think that big companies would have their own collection of failed products, but they don't. The people who run the museum found out that many companies didn't keep their failed products because they didn't want to think about their mistakes. 
The museum was started by a man named Robert McMath. He wanted to collect new products, not just failed ones. But he found out that most products don't work well. 
In the world, people like to think positively and not talk about their mistakes. This is because our brains are wired to think that good things will happen. But sometimes thinking positively can actually make us less motivated to work hard. 
A psychologist named Gabriele Oettingen did some research on this. She found that when people think about how well they will do something, they actually do worse. 
Another psychologist, Carol Dweck, says that people's beliefs about ability affect how they feel about failure. Some people think that ability is fixed and that failure means they're not good enough. Others think that ability can grow through hard work and challenge. These people see failure as a chance to learn and get better. 
Dweck says that having this second way of thinking is better, even if it doesn't always lead to success."

Do sports teams do better when they play at home? Many people think so, but scientists and experts are not so sure. They want to know why teams do better at home. Some people think it's because the players feel more comfortable at home. Others think it's because the crowd cheers them on and helps them win.
But what if the team plays at a different place? Would it make a difference? Some people think so. They think the crowd is important because it helps the players feel more confident. When the crowd cheers, the players feel like they can do better.
But why do some sports teams do better at home than others? Basketball teams do very well at home, but baseball teams don't do as well. Maybe it's because basketball is a team sport, and teams work together to win. Baseball is more about individual players, so it's harder to feel like you're part of a team.
Another reason teams do better at home is because of something called ""home advantage"". It's like a special feeling that makes players want to win more when they're at home. It's like they're defending their territory. Some researchers found that players have higher levels of a hormone called testosterone when they play at home. This hormone makes them feel stronger and more confident.
So, why do teams do better at home? It's not just because of the crowd or the players' comfort. It's because of a combination of things, including teamwork, individual players, and the special feeling of playing at home."

Gary Player, a famous golfer, said ""The more I practise, the luckier I get."" But what does it really mean? Some people think it's just a joke, and Gary Player meant ""The more I practise, the better I get."" This is a big question in sports. Some people think that if you practice enough, you can be good at anything. But others think that some people are just naturally good at certain things.
A psychologist named Anders Ericsson said that if you practice for 10,000 hours, you can become an expert in anything. Many people agree with this idea. But a new book by Epstein says that this might not be true. He thinks that it's not just about practice. He looks at many examples, like a dog sled race in Alaska, where the dogs' desire to run is important. He also talks about how some people are naturally good at certain things, like Usain Bolt, who is the fastest man in the world.
Epstein says that it's not just about practice or environment. He thinks that both are important. He also talks about how men and women are different and why we separate them in sports. He asks questions like ""Why do we separate men and women in athletic competition?"" Sometimes the best questions are the most obvious.

Many children in rich countries are unhappy. They feel lonely and out of place. Why is this? Jay Griffiths thinks that children today are not spending enough time outside. They are stuck indoors, looking at screens, and missing out on nature. She believes that this is the main problem.
A recent study talked to children and found that many of them said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults also remember their own childhoods fondly, when they spent long days playing outside. They think this was better for them than the way children live today.
Griffiths argues that parents are too worried about danger and are keeping their children indoors too much. This is good for the toy and gadget industry, which sells things to keep children entertained at home. She also talks about how some schools are prescribing medicine for children who are restless, and how some children are forced to wear goggles to play.
Griffiths thinks that children should be allowed to be free and take risks. She believes that children need to have some accidents to learn how to avoid bigger accidents later. But she doesn't say how we can make this happen. Some people might think that not all children want to take risks, and that some might be happy staying at home.

I'm a scientist who studies how children learn and grow. I think that school is not the best way for children to learn. Children learn best when they play. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Children play a lot because they have a lot to learn. Play is how we learn important skills like thinking creatively, getting along with others, and controlling our emotions. These skills are not taught in school. They are learned through play.
Play is important for our future. We need people who can think creatively and solve problems. We need people who can work well with others and be kind to them. Children are born with a desire to play with others and learn social skills through play.
Unfortunately, school has become too serious. Children don't have enough breaks and have too much homework. They don't play freely like they used to. Adults often interfere and try to control their play. This is not good for children. They need to be free to play and make their own choices.
We should give children more freedom to play and explore. We should let them follow their natural instincts and learn through play. This will help them grow into strong and healthy adults who can face the challenges of the future.

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to find a job. They think it's a good way to contact employers directly. But social media can also be dangerous if you don't know how to use it. A young job seeker in the US contacted a marketing executive on LinkedIn. The executive was angry and sent a mean message. The message went viral and many people were shocked. The executive may have done the young job seeker a favor by showing that social media can be tricky to use professionally.
When we were teenagers, social media was just for fun. We used it to escape from our parents and teachers. We could be anyone we wanted to be online. But now, social media is for professional networking. It's different. We need to be careful and respectful.
Many young people are making mistakes on social media. They are too familiar with the people they contact and come across as arrogant. This is not true. We are just trying to find a job because it's hard to find one. We need to learn how to use social media correctly. We should introduce ourselves clearly and explain what we can do for the other person. We should also be humble and not send impersonal emails.
Social media can be a good way to make connections, but we need to use it carefully. If we don't, people may not want to talk to us."

Newspapers are not doing well. The number of people reading them has gone down a lot since 2000. Many experts think that soon, there will be no more printed newspapers. But, old things often survive. For example, books, theatre, and radio are still popular, even though new things came along. 
Newspapers were once new and exciting, but it took a long time for them to become popular. This was because it was hard to make and distribute newspapers quickly and cheaply. People used to think that everything stays the same, but now we know that things change all the time. 
Before, people didn't need news every day. They only got news when something important happened. Now, we can get news whenever we want. The internet makes it easy to find the news we want to read. We can even get updates as soon as something happens. 
But, newspapers are not very good at explaining how the world works. Maybe they will disappear. Or maybe they will find a way to help us understand the world better."

If we were meant to live in the dark, we would be happy to go out at night. But we are not. We are creatures that like the light of the sun. This is because our bodies are used to living in the sun's light. We don't think about it much, but it's true. 
We have made the night brighter by putting lights everywhere. This is like building a dam to control a river. It's good, but it also has bad effects. We call this bad effect ""light pollution"". 
Light pollution is when we shine lights into the sky instead of keeping them down on the ground. This makes it hard for some animals to live. It also affects us humans. We need the dark to sleep and be healthy. 
In the past, people didn't have many lights. They used candles and lanterns. London, a big city, was very dark at night. But now we have many lights and it's hard to see the stars. 
Many animals are active at night. Light is important for them. Some birds get lost because of bright lights. They fly around until they drop. 
We thought light pollution only affected people who study the stars. But it affects us all. We need the dark to be healthy. If we don't have dark, our bodies get mixed up. This can make us sick. 
We are like frogs near a bright highway. We are trapped by our own lights. We have forgotten how to live with the stars and the natural rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us lose our place in the universe. We forget how small we are."

A big company has announced that it will not keep track of its employees' holiday time. This idea came from an email from the company's founder's daughter. But is this a good idea? 
The company has 50,000 employees and many different jobs. It's hard for employees to know what's going on and who is working when. This makes it hard to decide if taking a holiday would be okay. 
The company's founder says that employees can take as much holiday as they want, as long as they make sure their work is done and won't be affected. But this is hard to do. There's always more work to do when you come back from holiday. 
This could lead to employees feeling guilty and stressed. They might not take holidays because they don't want to leave work undone. This could make them less productive in the long run. 
In the past, employees had a set amount of holiday time. This helped them feel safe and secure. Without it, they might not take holidays because they don't want to look lazy. 
Technology has changed the way we work. We can work from anywhere and at any time. This can make it hard to separate work and leisure time. 
I'm not sure if this new policy will really help employees take more holidays. It might actually make things worse. Employees need holidays to rest and be healthy. This is important for their well-being."

Here is the simplified text, rewritten for an A1 learner:
'Scientific papers are checked by other experts in the same field before they are published. This is called peer review. It helps to make sure that the papers are good and not wrong. But, it can take a long time and may not always work. Some scientists think that a new way of sharing papers, called preprints, could be better. Preprints are like early versions of a paper that are shared online before they are checked. This way, other scientists can read and comment on the paper quickly. This helps to make sure that the paper is good and also helps other scientists to learn from it.
Some people think that preprints are a good idea because they can be shared quickly and easily. They can also be used to share papers that are not accepted by big journals. This is important because it helps to share all the results of scientific research, not just the ones that are accepted by big journals. Preprints can also help to make sure that scientists are honest and do not try to hide their mistakes.
In the past, scientists used to share their work with each other by writing letters. Now, with preprints, they can share their work with the whole world. This can help to make science better and more open. It can also help to make sure that scientists are working together and sharing their knowledge.'

I ask my students what a poem is, and they often say it's like a picture made with words. But I don't think that's a good answer. One day, I asked my students to write two paragraphs about an object. One paragraph should describe the object like a scientist, and the other paragraph should be from the object's point of view, like it's talking to us. One student wrote about an oxygen mask. It's a strange object, but it helps people breathe when they need it. Most people don't use it often.
I used to think poetry was confusing and didn't make sense. But when I tried to write about an object like a scientist, I realized that poetry is special. It's not like other writing. Poetry can be surprising and make us think about things in a new way. Some people think poetry is like a machine, but it's not. It's more like a special kind of object that can make us feel things. Poetry is different from other writing because it's not just for entertainment or to tell a story. It's for its own sake. That's why we can find it surprising and interesting, even when it's just a few lines on a page.

I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It cost £70, which was a lot of money back then. My wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip out. Over the years, I've found many other things, like brooches and coins, and each one makes me happy because it connects me to the past.
It took 40 years for me to find something that impressed Marion again. One rainy day, I decided to search a field near my home. The first time my detector beeped, I found a piece of an old wheel. Then, it beeped again. I couldn't ignore it, so I dug deeper. After a while, I saw a golden ball. I thought it might be a curtain rail, but as I cleaned it, it became clear it was a beautiful, intricate necklace. I knew it was special because I had seen something similar at the British Museum.
I took it home and showed it to Marion. We were both very excited. We didn't try it on because it was too valuable. We hid it in our wardrobe, but I was worried about it being stolen. So, I hid it in my office under a floorboard.
After 14 days, I had to tell the authorities about my find. I took it to the council office in a plastic bag. The man in charge was surprised and authenticated it. It was sold to my local council and is now in the British Museum in London. We got £350,000 from the sale, which we split. But the torc is more than just money. It's something I've saved for everyone.

I love sleeping when I travel. But I don't talk about it much because I feel a little shy. When my friends tell me about their trips and all the things they do, I smile and don't say much. They plan their trips carefully, with lots of activities like visiting museums and hiking. My trips are different. I like to sleep in the afternoon and take naps in the sun. I also like to sleep in late in the morning and enjoy my bed.
When I went to Mexico, I slept a lot. I slept more than 12 hours a day! It was nice to sleep in a new place, surrounded by new sounds and smells. I felt relaxed and happy.
I think sleep is an important part of traveling. When we travel, we see and experience new things. We meet new people and try new foods. When we sleep, our brains process all these new things. It's like our brains are working hard to make sense of everything.
Sleeping is also different in different places. In some countries, people sleep at different times. In Trinidad, people wake up early and then take a long nap in the middle of the day. When I went there, it took me a few days to get used to this new way of sleeping. But when I finally did, I felt like I was really a part of the place.
I also like to sleep in new places because it's a way to experience the local culture. In the Dominican Republic, I took a nap with my friends and felt like I was really a part of their daily routine. I realized that sleep is an important part of life, not just a way to rest.
I think I should be proud of my love for sleep while traveling. It's a way to slow down and enjoy my experiences. Maybe I should tell my friends about it and show them that sleep is an important part of traveling too."

I was a bit scared at first, but I quickly learned how to drive the sled and take care of the dogs. It was hard work, but I was proud of myself. I even learned how to chop wood and use a saw in the snow.

Paula Radcliffe ran a very fast marathon. She finished the race quickly. The journalists were surprised. They asked her about a special oil she used to help her heal from an injury. This oil was recommended by Cathy Freeman, a famous athlete.
Paula didn't think about how fast she ran. She just did it. She and her team didn't set a goal for her. They said ""no limits"". During the race, Paula's husband and coach were in a car, listening to the radio. They were worried she was going too fast.
Paula thought she could finish the race in under 2 hours and 16 minutes. She ran very fast for a long time, but then she sprinted to the finish. She was very happy.
People were surprised she beat the East African runners. They asked how she did it. Paula's physiotherapist said she was very strong and could handle a lot of pain. He said she would hurt him rather than him hurt her.
Paula's physiotherapist worked with her for a long time. He said she was very dedicated and would do whatever it took to get better. Paula said she didn't know why no one has beaten her record. She thought it was because people are racing each other instead of racing themselves.
Paula's marathon was her best ever. She inspired many women to start running long distances.

I made a TV show about cooking called 'In Search of Perfection'. I was worried about how people would like it. Would they like learning about food and its history, and how it's made? I watched the first show and didn't need to worry. The show was a success and led to other projects. I wrote books about my experiences and my restaurant. In these books, I travel to different places to learn about food and meet people who make food. In my latest book, I go on a journey to find people who make food perfectly. Perfection is different for everyone. Even choosing which dishes to include in the book was hard. Some people might not like the choices I made. But I think each of us has our own idea of what is perfect. I used my skills and knowledge to learn about food and share it with others.

We were driving to Marrakech when our van broke down. John got out to look at the engine. He stood there for a long time, looking serious. Then he said, 'I don't know what I'm doing.' He and my mum started laughing. My sister Bea was worried. 'We can't stay here forever,' she said. There was a big field around us with lots of flowers. 'We can't stay here forever,' I said, because it's always better to agree with Bea.
We got back in the van and waited for John to find someone to fix the car. My mum lay down on the grass and said, 'Tell us a story.' My sister and I lay down next to her. I told them about two birds I heard talking in London before we left. I told them what the birds said about breadcrumbs, other birds, and the weather. I even told them about a fight the birds had over a worm.
But then my sister said, 'That's stupid, no one understands bird language.' I got upset because I remembered every word the birds said. John came back with some boys from Morocco who helped us push the van to a hotel. My sister didn't want to get out, but the boys didn't mind. They waved and smiled at her through the window.
We went into the hotel café and had some sweet tea made from mint leaves. John was worried about the car, but my mum said we would just have some tea. We stayed there all day while John tried to fix the car. When it got dark, we went to sleep on the hotel grounds. The next morning, John said we would have to have the van towed to Marrakech. We sat in a truck watching our van being pulled behind it. My sister was scared, but John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she's sitting in the front with the driver. I'm worried about how we'll get home now that our van is broken. Maybe we could take a boat to London. Then I fell asleep.

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at a party in a big hotel room. They were both older than her and spoke good English. They talked about the music they played and where they had traveled. Lucy told them she was going to a big music festival in the summer. The man from Tokyo asked her how old she was, and she said 15. The woman from a European city said ""Wow"". Lucy didn't mean to brag. She was just talking about her music. 
Lucy's grandfather came and took her away from the conversation. He said, ""Don't get too friendly with the other pianists. They are all competition."" Lucy's grandfather made her talk to many people at the party. She smiled and nodded, but didn't really listen. 
After the party, Lucy's grandfather said, ""You did well, Lucy. I'm proud of you. Many people know who you are, and they think you're very good."" Lucy liked being known and respected for her music."

'My dad said, ""It's not good for you to spend so much time online. You should go out and see the world."" But I wanted to know what experts think. They say that most teenagers who use social media have many friends, a good sense of who they are, and learn important skills. Simon Miles, an expert, says that social media is a normal part of growing up. Teenagers don't just use it to check emails like adults do; they live online. It's what you do with it that matters.
Jim Matthews, another expert, says that social media is like a virtual youth club. Teenagers use it to share jokes and gossip with friends, just like their parents did when they were younger. It helps them develop their sense of identity and learn to deal with problems and make friends.
Professor Keith Davidson says that social media can help teenagers find out who they are. They can share their interests and see what others like. He also says that it can be helpful for shy people to practice social skills online before doing it in person.
Professor Andrew Phillips thinks that social media can be good for quiet people who have special interests. They can connect with others who like the same things.
Pauline White, an expert on digital education, says that social media is becoming a creative force. Teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about things they like. They are also sharing photos and learning from each other. This will be helpful when they grow up and go to work.
Experts agree that teenagers who use social media creatively will have an advantage when they are adults. They will be able to work with others and create content to share with others.'

My parents planned a big road trip for our summer vacation. We drove across nine US states and one Canadian province. My dad wanted to do something different and fun. My mom and dad said, ""Not many people do this anymore."" My brother and I were a little worried. We packed our car with suitcases, food, and clothes. We set off on a big adventure.
We drove through Oklahoma and saw many things. We saw a big dust storm and had to stop for the night. We learned that cows have the right of way on the road! The next day, we went to the Great Sand Dunes and saw beautiful mountains. We smelled sulfur in a town called Pagosa Springs. We saw many old and new things everywhere we went.
We had some funny moments, like when we saw a ""CLOSED"" sign at a special place. We saw many wind farms and went to Yellowstone National Park. We saw bears and had to wait for them to cross the road. We even saw one bear up close! We stayed in a old hotel with no internet or phone. It was hard to leave, but we saw amazing views.
When we got back home, we were happy to be together again. We took many pictures and will always remember our trip. The things I'll remember are the unexpected and spontaneous things we did.

We went to a special ski school in the US to learn freestyle skiing. Our instructor, Gareth, told us to go fast, not slow. One of our friends, David, went first and didn't do well. He fell down and lost his skis. Gareth said, ""Speed is not always easy to control."" I had never done freestyle skiing before and was a bit scared. I thought it would be fun to try, but I wasn't sure if I was good enough. 
At the school, we practiced on trampolines and small jumps. It was fun to bounce around and try new things. Gareth helped us and gave us advice. I had trouble at first, but I kept trying. Finally, I landed properly and felt proud. But then I lost my skis again! Gareth was happy for me, and I was happy too."

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. You're scared and your heart is racing. The rollercoaster stops, then goes up slowly. Then it goes down quickly and you feel like you're flying. You might scream because it's so exciting! But you knew it was going to be scary when you paid to get into the park.
Many people love rollercoasters, but it's not just fun to ride them. Behind the scenes, there are many people working hard to make sure the rides are safe and exciting. They are engineers, designers, and marketing experts. They have to make sure the ride is not too scary, but still fun.
A rollercoaster designer is a very important job. They have to make sure the ride is safe and exciting. They also have to make sure it's different from other rides so people will want to ride it again. Some people might think that rollercoasters are getting more and more extreme, but most of the ideas for new rides come from a man named John Miller who invented some of the first rollercoasters a long time ago.
I talked to some experts who design rollercoasters. They said that the most important thing is to make sure the ride is safe and fun. They have to balance the thrill of the ride with making sure people don't get too scared. They also have to think about what kind of story they want to tell with the ride, like a space adventure or a jungle chase. They have to use all of these ideas to make a ride that people will love.
One expert said that the best rollercoaster designers are people who love rollercoasters themselves. They know what makes a ride exciting and can test the ride before it opens to the public. Another expert said that even with new technology like virtual reality, the physical rollercoaster experience will always be the best."

Miranda Ellington is a choreographer. She is 25 years old and has already worked with many theaters and dance companies. She still likes to dance sometimes. I asked her why she does both jobs. She said that dancing again reminds her of what it was like to be a dancer and how hard it can be. As a choreographer, she likes working with young students. They are open to new ideas and are eager to learn. They don't know what they can and can't do, so they listen to her advice.
When Miranda starts working with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. She tries to make the best dance routine for the music, even if she doesn't like the music. If the dancers don't like the music, she tries to find a solution. She likes to work with different people and companies, but she has to adapt to each one's way of working.
I asked her about a recent documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. She said it was a good documentary because it showed the hard work and dedication that goes into being a dancer. She said that people often don't understand how hard it is.
I asked her what makes a good dance production. She said that it's when everything comes together - the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. She said that aiming high is important, even if it's not perfect. She has worked on many different projects and doesn't like to be labeled as just a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist. She wants to keep trying new things.

I went on a big adventure with my friends. Someone asked me why I travel when I can watch TV at home. I said, ""Why sit at home when there's so much to see outside?"" This made me think of a new idea. A friend was giving away his old sofa, so I took it and fixed it to make it special. I put my bag on it and slept on it every night, even on the beach once. Some friends joined me and helped pull the sofa along. This was a new kind of adventure for me. I walked a long way and could stop at cafes to rest and have a coffee. People would ask me, ""Why are you doing this?"" and I would say, ""I'm not doing it for charity or training for a marathon. I just wanted to do something new and fun."" You can see the story on my website.

'I read about a swimming trip in the sea around small Greek islands. I was excited because I'd never done a group trip before. My brother was busy, so I decided to join a group. The man at the port was surprised when I asked for a single ticket. I told him I was going to swim with a group of friends. He was still a bit confused, but he smiled and showed me to the boat.
We met our group on the boat, but we didn't have much time to talk before we started swimming. Our guides told us that a boat would follow us and help us if we needed it. We did a short swim to split into groups, then we did a longer swim. I was a bit nervous because I'm not used to swimming in the open sea. The waves were big, and I was swimming slowly. I watched the faster swimmers go ahead. I wanted to finish the swim, so I kept going. I was happy when I finished on my own.
The next days were the same: we got in the water, swam at a comfortable pace, and stopped to look at the beautiful views. As we swam farther, I got faster and happier. We didn't need the support boat much. I'm excited to go again next year.'"

I like my job as a flight attendant. I get to travel to many places, like the US and Australia. I work with nice people and have a lot of free time. It's not a boring job, which is great for someone like me who is young. When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I would fly alone and sometimes I would help the flight attendants serve food to the passengers. This made me happy. Later, I wanted to change my job and I found this new job. I was nervous before the interview, so I practiced what to say. I told them about my good qualities and my previous work experience. I got the job! I would recommend this job to others because it's a good job. I get to see many new places and meet new people. Sometimes, I don't have to work too much, and if I do have a difficult passenger, I know it will soon be over.

At my summer camp, I like seeing the children learn new things. Many children know how to swim and play table-tennis, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some children feel a little scared, but with encouragement, they try and succeed. This makes them feel happy.
Some children miss their homes at first, especially the 10-13 year olds. We don't let them use their phones all the time. They can phone home after lunch, but not later. Most children get used to it after a few days and have a great time. We get some parents who call us many times to ask about their child. But sometimes, their child is busy playing or doing something else, so we ask them to call back later.
We also get some children who wear new, expensive clothes. These children sometimes argue when we tell them to change, but they understand why soon.

'Rock the Planet, a musical show, opened in London. It was already popular in the USA, where it won 'Best Musical' four times. But it was hard to find British actors who could also play music well. In the UK, actors can't do as many shows as they can in the USA. So, they needed twice as many actors. Luckily, they found many talented British actors. The show is very popular in London and is full every night. People love the songs that were popular in America.
I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He said it's great that he gets paid to play the guitar. He told me that the actors are very busy. They have school lessons every day at the theatre. Jamie misses his old friends, but his whole class came to see the show. They loved it, and Jamie felt proud.
Jamie and the other young actors like to play music together. They even let me join in and play a song with them. It was fun! Jamie was very good at playing the guitar and showed me how to play. I was happy when I finally got it right.
The young actors were already good musicians, but they had never played in a band before. They found it easy to play together, but at first, they forgot to smile when they performed. The show will be in London for another year, and it's worth seeing.'
