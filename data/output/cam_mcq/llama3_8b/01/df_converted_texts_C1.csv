Some time ago, a website highlighted the risks of sharing our whereabouts online. The website's point was that by sharing our location, we're also sharing our movements with many people we may not want to meet. This idea fits with the growing awareness that the internet has both positive and negative effects. The internet offers many opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, but it also has its risks.

In the early days of the internet, a group of pioneers explored these risks and learned from their experiences. They shared their thoughts, photos, and stories online, and many of them faced challenges and consequences. These pioneers, who are now known as bloggers, have already navigated the dangers of the internet and can serve as a guide for the rest of us.

One of these pioneers is Justin Hall, who started posting online in 1994. He shared his life, including his personal thoughts and photos, and his website became popular. However, he faced challenges when he started writing about his personal life, including a romantic relationship. His partner asked him to stop blogging or end the relationship, and he chose to stop blogging.

Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, had a similar experience. She wrote about her job and her colleagues, but an anonymous colleague shared her blog with her bosses, and she lost her job. This experience is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they wouldn't say in person. However, the internet is not a separate reality where we can say anything without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and we must be careful about what we share.

Heather Armstrong eventually restarted her blog and focused on her family. She learned that while the internet allows us to share our thoughts and experiences, we should be mindful of the consequences of our actions. We should remember that the internet is a powerful tool that can have a significant impact on our lives.<|eot_id|>"

A few years ago, some scientists started warning people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? The film uses a mix of documentary and drama to show that there's a lot we don't understand about the universe. This is not a new idea, as scientists can't claim to know everything. However, some scientists felt strongly enough to issue public warnings, describing the film as ""atrocious"" or ""dangerous"". This sparked my curiosity, and I decided to watch the film.

At first, I didn't see what all the fuss was about. Scientists were simply saying that new discoveries were showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. But when the film discussed some of these discoveries, I began to understand the excitement. For example, it talked about how water molecules can be affected by thought. I had heard of a Japanese researcher who found that the shape of a water molecule can change just by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals that looked nice when someone happy was talking to them and nasty when someone in a bad mood was talking to them. Many people find this idea fascinating and compelling, but scientists are more skeptical.

The film's claims are indeed amazing, but they need more evidence to be convincing. The problem is that the film's evidence was not strong enough. The film's claims about water molecules are impressive, but we need more proof that the effect is real. The real issue is that the film's claims are not extreme enough. In reality, scientists have found that the universe is even stranger than the film claims. For example, they have discovered that the universe is made up of an unknown form of matter and is being propelled by a mysterious force called ""dark energy"". On a smaller scale, neuroscientists have found that our perception of events is delayed by half a second, which is edited out by our brains. Anthropologists have also found the birthplace of modern humans and how they left it to populate the world. Some scientists even think they have found links between the existence of life on Earth and the design of the universe.

Despite what some people might think, science is not complete. In fact, we are further away from knowing everything than ever. The concepts of chaos and quantum uncertainty have shown that we can never know everything. This has led some of the world's leading physicists to try to create a single equation that sums up all the forces and particles of the universe. Many of us believe that the universe is best summed up in one word: incredible.<|eot_id|>"

Writing novels is a challenging task, but writing short stories is a joy. It's like comparing planting a forest to planting a garden. Both processes are important, and they complement each other. When I finish a novel, I often want to write some short stories. After completing a group of short stories, I feel like focusing on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I never write a novel while working on short stories. This is because writing novels and short stories engage different parts of my brain, and it takes time to switch between them.

I started writing short stories in 1984, and it was a new experience for me. I felt that my writing possibilities expanded, and readers appreciated this new side of me as a writer. One of my early short stories, 'Breaking Waves', was included in my first collection of short stories, Tales from Abroad.

Writing short stories is appealing because they don't take as long to finish as novels. It usually takes me about a week to get a short story into shape, although revisions can be endless. With short stories, I can create a story from a small idea, a word, or an image. It's like jazz improvisation, and the story takes me where it wants to go. Another advantage is that I don't have to worry about failing. Even experienced writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write masterpieces. I find this comforting, as I can learn from my mistakes and use them in my next story.

For me, short stories are like an experimental laboratory for my novels. They allow me to try out new ideas and techniques without the pressure of writing a novel. Without short stories, I would find writing novels even more difficult and demanding. My short stories are like footprints I've left behind, and I remember exactly where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these intimate feelings with my readers.<|eot_id|>"

Science is a complex and multifaceted field that has both fascinated and puzzled humans for centuries. It has the power to cure diseases, improve our daily lives, and even threaten our very existence. Scientists have made incredible discoveries, from understanding the tiny atoms to the vastness of the universe. However, this progress has not been without its challenges and controversies. Established theories have been repeatedly challenged and replaced, and scientists have often clashed over their interpretations.

Science is a constantly evolving field, and its beauty is not always immediately apparent. It requires a deep understanding of complex concepts and a willingness to question and doubt. Despite its limitations, science has the power to change the world, and its impact on society is undeniable.

In the past, science has been characterized by conflict and competition. Scientists have often disagreed on the best approach, and their discoveries have sometimes been met with skepticism or even ridicule. However, these challenges have ultimately led to breakthroughs and a deeper understanding of the world.

Today, science is not just about discovering new facts; it is also about shaping the future. Scientists are working to develop new technologies and solve some of the world's most pressing problems. As a result, it is essential for non-scientists to stay informed about the latest developments and their potential impact on our lives.

In conclusion, science is a dynamic and complex field that has the power to transform our understanding of the world and our place in it. It is a journey that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to adapt and learn. As we move forward, it is crucial that we recognize the importance of science and its role in shaping our future.<|eot_id|>"

For several years, ebook sales grew rapidly. However, from around 2015, major publishers reported a decline in ebook sales or even a complete stop in some cases. This led to doubts about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some publishing executives admitted that the hype surrounding ebooks might have led to unwise investments, causing them to lose faith in the power of printed books. Despite the fact that digital and print books can coexist, the question of whether ebooks will 'kill' print books still sparks debate.

The idea of a medium replacing another is not new. In the past, critics predicted the demise of radio with the advent of television, and of books with the introduction of audiobooks. But in each case, the old medium found new uses and survived. The same is true for print books, which have adapted to new technologies and continue to thrive.

The idea of the death of the book is not just about ebooks; it's also about our emotional attachment to media. We form strong bonds with objects like books, TVs, and computers, and when a new technology emerges, it disrupts our relationship with the old one. As a result, we often romanticize the past and seek out retro products or older technologies.

The spread of the printing press, the shift from silent to sound movies, and the transition from analog to digital photography are all examples of this phenomenon. The emergence of e-readers has sparked a new appreciation for the tactile qualities of printed books, including their smell.

While the idea of the disappearing book might be alarming, it's also a reflection of our fascination with technology and our fear of change. We use familiar narratives, such as stories of tragedy and loss, to make sense of these changes and to express our emotions. The story of the death of the book is a way to explore our hopes and fears about innovation and transformation.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 learner:

For 18 months, I started my day at 5:30 am, brushed my teeth, made some coffee, and sat down to write about how famous people throughout history managed their daily routines. I wanted to explore how they found time to do their best work, how they organized their days to be creative and productive. By looking at the everyday habits of these people, I hoped to gain a new perspective on their personalities and careers. As the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat and whether you take a nap, and I'll tell you how creative you are.""

My book is about the habits and routines of creative people, not just their work. It's about how they make time for their art and how they prioritize their daily tasks. It's also personal, as I struggle with the same issues in my own life. For example, how do you balance creative work with earning a living? Is it better to focus on one project or work on multiple things at once? When you have too much to do, do you have to sacrifice something, or can you find ways to work more efficiently?

I don't claim to have all the answers, but I've tried to provide examples of how successful and talented people have handled these challenges. I wanted to show how their daily routines influenced their work and vice versa. The title of my book is ""Daily Rituals,"" but I focused on people's routines and habits. A routine can be ordinary, but it can also be a powerful tool for achieving your goals. The psychologist William James believed that having a routine can free up your mind to focus on more important things.

I actually got the idea for this book because I was procrastinating on a writing task one Sunday afternoon. Instead of working, I was tidying my office and making coffee. As a morning person, I'm more focused in the mornings, but I'm not very productive in the afternoons. I started searching the internet for information on other writers' schedules and found it fascinating. I decided to create a blog to collect these stories and eventually turned it into this book. The book is based on my blog, but it's more extensive and better researched. I've tried to let my subjects speak for themselves, using quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. I've also included summaries of their routines from secondary sources. I want to thank the many researchers and scholars whose work I drew upon to make this book possible. You can find a list of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide for further reading.<|eot_id|>"

Howard became interested in paleontology when he was six years old. His family couldn't afford a trip to Spain, so they went to the English coast instead. On the beach, Howard found an ammonite, a type of fossil. He decided he wanted to become a paleontologist and focus on the earliest fossils. After finishing his university studies, Howard knew he wanted to work on delicate creatures found on grey rocks. He completed his PhD thesis and was unsure if he would get a job. He applied for an assistant lecturer position at Tavistock College in London, but wasn't hopeful.

On the day of the interview, the professor who was supposed to chair the panel had a disagreement with his wife and ended up in the hospital. A different professor, who didn't like Howard's mentor, was appointed to the panel and helped Howard get the job. Howard was surprised but grateful.

Months later, a colleague explained the situation to him, and Howard realized that he had gotten the job due to a personal connection rather than his qualifications. He was slightly disappointed but happy to have the job and be able to do the work he loved.

Howard often contrasted his professional life, where he could plan and control his work, with the unpredictability of his personal life. His professional life was affected when his briefcase containing his lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. He reported the theft and postponed his lecture. Later, he met a colleague who was hosting a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. The curator mentioned a new collection of fossils that Howard was eager to study. Without the theft, Howard might not have learned about the collection and might not have had the opportunity to secure his professional future.

Within an hour, Howard adjusted his plans and decided to visit the museum in Nairobi instead of attending a conference in Stockholm or taking a field trip to Scotland.<|eot_id|>"

Charles Spence, a professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, is fascinated by the way our senses interact to shape our perception of food and drink. He and his team are exploring how to make unusual foods more appealing, like ice cream made from bee larvae. Spence's research has a significant impact on the food industry, from giant food companies to high-end restaurants. He has discovered that various factors, such as who we eat with, how food is presented, and the background noise, can affect our taste.

Spence's book, ""The Perfect Meal"", is filled with fascinating insights. For example, did you know that the person who orders first in a restaurant tends to enjoy their food more? And that we eat more when eating with others? His laboratory at Oxford is surprisingly low-tech, with soundproof booths and old audio-visual equipment. This allows him to work with chefs who can't fund academic research themselves.

Spence's work is often funded by major food companies. Historically, this type of research was seen as less prestigious, but since the government has emphasized the importance of making research relevant and impactful, this type of collaboration has become more popular. Spence is currently helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. He points out that it's in their interest to do so, as it helps loyal customers stay healthy.

Spence has also worked with famous chefs, like Heston Blumenthal, to create unique dishes. For example, the ""Sound of the Sea"" dish, which uses sound to enhance the flavor. His research has also shown that certain types of music can affect our perception of sweetness and bitterness. An airline is planning to use his research to match music with food, and a well-known brand has released a smartphone app that plays music while your ice cream softens.

At home, Spence and his family enjoy experimenting with food and sound. They have had dinner parties with unusual themes, such as eating rabbit with fur-wrapped cutlery or playing with light bulbs. For Spence, the line between his laboratory and his home is blurred, as he sees his work as an extension of his daily life.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Our brains are constantly bombarded with information, including facts, rumors, and opinions. We need to filter out what's important and ignore the rest. At the same time, we're doing more tasks than ever before. We're responsible for making our own travel arrangements, finding what we need in shops, and managing our daily lives. Our smartphones help us stay connected, but they also contribute to the pressure to cram as much as possible into our busy lives.

However, our brains are not designed to multitask effectively. We may think we're doing several things at once, but in reality, we're rapidly switching between tasks, which can be stressful and inefficient. Multitasking can lead to mental fatigue, stress, and decreased productivity. It can also make us more prone to making mistakes and poor decisions.

Research has shown that multitasking can reduce our cognitive abilities, making it harder to focus and make good decisions. Even simple tasks like checking email can be distracting and take up a significant amount of mental energy. In fact, the constant stream of emails can be overwhelming, making it difficult to get anything else done.

The constant pressure to multitask and respond to emails can be exhausting. It's no wonder that our brains are overwhelmed and our productivity suffers as a result.<|eot_id|>"

In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino broke up concrete at night and threw the pieces at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other female bats who are having trouble giving birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought animals just behaved in certain ways and that was it. They didn't think animals had feelings or moral values. However, recent research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has changed this perspective. Scientists are now exploring the emotions of animals, and this has led to a debate about whether animals are conscious and have moral values.

This debate has also raised questions about animal welfare and our treatment of them. For example, a study showed that cows that figured out how to open a gate to get food were happier than those that didn't. If cows enjoy problem-solving, what does this mean for the way we raise and eat them? Some experts believe that this research means we should stop eating meat, while others think we should just be more considerate of animal welfare.

There are different opinions on this issue, and some scientists think that we should stop attributing human-like qualities to animals. Others believe that animals have a simpler way of thinking, but still have feelings and values. The debate is not just about science, but also about philosophy and our relationship with animals. It's a complex issue that may not have a clear answer.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Critical thinking is a way to understand and analyze what we read or hear. Adrian West, a researcher at the Edward de Bono Foundation, believes that argument is a way to find the truth. However, he also thinks that technology is changing the way we approach complex problems and making it harder to think critically. We are exposed to more information, but this can be overwhelming and make it difficult to make good decisions.

In fact, the amount of data and information available does not necessarily mean we have more knowledge or make better decisions. According to West, the quality of our thinking has not improved despite the abundance of information. The National Endowment for the Arts reports that reading has declined by 10 percentage points, and this trend is accelerating.

Many experts, including Patricia Greenfield, a psychology professor, think that the focus on visual media is a problem. She believes that a decline in reading has contributed to a decline in critical thinking. People are now more focused on instant media and multi-tasking, rather than focusing on one thing.

It's difficult to say exactly how technology affects critical thinking. However, it's clear that technology can be both positive and negative. For example, a computer game can promote critical thinking or hinder it. Reading on the internet can improve our ability to analyze, but following links can make it harder to think deeply.

According to Greenfield, exposure to technology changes the way people think. She has analyzed over 50 studies on learning and technology and found that reading enhances thinking and imagination, while visual media can improve some types of information processing. However, most visual media do not allow time for reflection, analysis, or imagination.

The outcome is that many people, especially younger ones, are not reaching their full potential. The way society views technology affects how we perceive critical thinking. The relationship between video games and cognition is a good example of this. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, argues that video games are not only a form of entertainment but also a tool for learning. In fact, an increasing amount of evidence suggests that video games can help build smarter children with better reasoning skills.

Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in virtual environments that resemble the real world. They also give players the freedom to explore ideas and concepts that might be inaccessible otherwise. In the digital age, it's clear that we need to understand the subtleties of how technology affects thinking and analysis.<|eot_id|>"

Matthew Crawford is a philosopher who has written several books about how we should live our lives. When he's not writing, he works as a motorcycle mechanic, a job he chose after becoming disillusioned with office work. His latest book is about how to cope with the demands of modern life.

Crawford noticed that advertisements are now everywhere, even when we're just trying to do simple tasks like paying with our credit cards. He thinks that these constant demands on our attention are making it harder for us to focus on what's important to us. We're also losing the ability to have conversations with strangers and enjoy simple activities like chatting with friends.

Crawford believes that technology, such as video games and social media, is partly to blame. These things reflect our desires and can take over our lives. He's not the only one who thinks this; many people feel overwhelmed by the constant stream of information and notifications.

It's not just technology that's the problem, though. Crawford thinks that the way we live our lives is also to blame. We're so used to having constant choices and options that we're losing the ability to control ourselves. This is affecting our relationships and our ability to connect with others.

Crawford suggests that we need to find ways to engage with the world in a more meaningful way. He thinks that activities like cooking, playing sports, or riding a motorcycle can help us do this. These activities require us to focus on the present moment and to interact with others in a more authentic way.

He also believes that we need to find ways to regulate noise and distractions in public spaces. This could help us to focus and be more present in our daily lives. By doing so, we can regain control over our attention and build stronger relationships with others.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 learner:

""What do you do for a living?"" This is a common question, and people usually answer it quickly. But when you're a philosopher, it's harder. Saying you're a philosopher can sound pretentious, like you're claiming to be special. In reality, philosophers are just like everyone else, but the idea that they're somehow superior has stuck around.

One reason for this is that philosophers have a reputation for judging others and celebrating intellectual pursuits. Aristotle, a famous philosopher, believed that a life of contemplation was the most virtuous. Many modern philosophers disagree, but the idea persists. Another philosopher, Socrates, said that an unexamined life is not worth living. This means that a life that just follows the crowd without thinking about it is unsatisfying. 

Philosophy is often associated with deep thinking and reflection. But it doesn't have to be that way. It's about looking closely at the everyday things that make up our lives and making sure they're worth doing. It's not about being a sage or a genius; it's about being practical and sharing knowledge with others.

Another reason philosophers are misunderstood is that academic philosophy has become isolated from everyday life. Philosophers often write for other experts, using specialized language that's hard to understand. This makes it seem like philosophy is only for academics, not for ordinary people. But philosophy should be for everyone, and it can help us make sense of our lives.

I often describe myself as an ethicist, because I work in the area of ethics, which is about evaluating human behavior. But I'm starting to realize that this label doesn't capture the full range of my work. Ethics is often associated with rules and laws, but it's also about exploring how we think about responsibility, art, and consumerism. Philosophy can help us examine our daily habits and behaviors, and this can be beneficial for everyone.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Foodies and those who love food often think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make our culinary experiences even more enjoyable. However, philosophers have traditionally focused on other topics rather than food itself. When philosophers have talked about eating, it was usually just a metaphor for something else, like gaining knowledge. Some philosophical discussions about food seem to be about food at first, but upon closer examination, they are actually discussing something else. 

The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus believed in pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain, but he didn't just mean eating and drinking. Despite this, his name is often associated with a love of food and drink. Restaurants, food shops, and online recipe sites use his name to suggest that their products are approved by a famous philosopher. 

Food is a social and cultural aspect of our lives. The food we eat comes from our communities and is shared with others. These communities provide us with friends and family, as well as the infrastructure to grow and distribute food. Food is unique because we interact with it more frequently and in a more fundamental way than with any other commodity. This makes it an important topic for philosophical discussion. 

When we eat, critics will write and talk about it. But why do they get to decide what's good or bad? One philosopher suggests that tasting food is not a special skill, but rather that influential food critics are just better at describing what they taste. 

Another aspect of food is aesthetics. We talk about beautiful paintings or music, but not the taste of food. Some philosophers argue that, with the rise of modern gastronomy, food should be considered an aesthetic experience like sculpture or poetry. However, food is destroyed when we eat it, unlike other aesthetic objects that can be appreciated over time. 

There are also ethical issues surrounding food. We can ask questions like ""What should we eat?"" and ""How should we produce food?"" The answers will often reveal our values and beliefs. Philosophers will examine these questions and engage in debates about them. 

Cooking at home is different from cooking in a restaurant. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests, which is based on the relationships of love and friendship. In contrast, restaurant chefs have obligations to their employers and the food itself, which means their kitchens are not open to everyone and their relationships are with colleagues, not friends. 

A recent essay explored how food and dining can bring people together across cultures. This can happen in two ways: by learning to appreciate other cultures' foods and by sharing meals with people from other cultures. This practice has a long history in international diplomacy. The essay is full of interesting examples and anecdotes that make this aspect of food philosophy come alive for the general reader.<|eot_id|>"

Rob Daviau, an American game designer, created 'legacy' board games. He wanted to make games more exciting and challenging than the ones he played as a child. He thought, ""Why not add a storyline? Why not make decisions permanent?"" He took an old game called Risk and turned it into Risk Legacy. Players could tear up cards, damage the board, or open new rules. The game lasted for a set number of sessions, and players' actions had lasting effects.

Daviau worked on a legacy version of Pandemic, a popular cooperative game where players work together to save the world from diseases. His next project was SeaFall, a game set in the age of sail. Players became sailors, exploring the world and conquering new lands. To make sure the story didn't fall apart, designers had to consider all possible player choices. They tested the game with players to see how it would unfold.

Daviau thought legacy games would be a niche idea, but they became very popular. Many players loved the concept, saying it was a new level of excitement and commitment. They enjoyed the feeling of being part of an unfolding adventure, like a TV series. Game designers like Matt Leacock compared the process to writing a novel. They needed to have an idea of how the story would end and begin, but also leave room for surprises.

Colby Dauch, a game publisher, thinks the legacy format changed the way people think about board games. He believes it's a game-changer. Daviau, however, thinks that soon gamers will want something new and different.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

In 2016, an octopus named Inky escaped from a tank at the National Aquarium in New Zealand. He climbed out of the tank, crossed the floor, and squeezed into a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This story was widely shared online and was like something from a children's movie. One of the reasons people enjoyed the story was because it's fun to imagine animals as being like us. Octopuses, in particular, are fascinating because they are very intelligent, but their bodies are very different from ours. They can open jars, recognize faces, and even play games. Some people think it's unscientific to attribute human-like qualities to animals, but Dr. Frans de Waal, a scientist who studies primates, argues that it's actually the opposite. He says that many people have a tendency to underestimate the intelligence of animals, which he calls ""anthropodenial"". De Waal has spent decades studying animal cognition and has found that many animals exhibit behaviors that were once thought to be unique to humans, such as the ability to think about the past and future, show empathy, and understand the intentions of others. In fact, animals are much smarter than we often give them credit for.

In the past, people believed that animals were capable of complex thought and even put them on trial for crimes. However, with the rise of behaviorism in the 20th century, the focus shifted to conditioning animals through rewards and punishments, and many people began to view animals as stimulus-response machines or robots. This change in perspective coincided with the destruction of animal habitats, pollution, and the development of methods for raising livestock that ignored animal welfare. Fortunately, de Waal believes that we are now moving away from this dark period and recognizing that animal cognition is on the same spectrum as human intelligence, even if it's not at the same level. To test animal intelligence, de Waal suggests designing tests that take into account the specific abilities and traits of each species. For example, squirrels are great at remembering where they hide nuts, while humans need apps to find their phones.

In her book, naturalist Sy Montgomery notes that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might test us on our ability to change the color of our skin, and we would likely fail. De Waal is skeptical of Inky's escape story, but he recognizes the power of viral stories to raise awareness about animal intelligence. He once conducted an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys can experience envy, and the results were surprising. The study was published in a scientific journal, but it was a short video clip of the experiment that really convinced people of the findings.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the passage for a C1 learner:

The field of robotics is expected to bring about a significant technological shift, comparable to the Industrial Revolution. While robots have been used in the automotive and manufacturing sectors for a long time, experts predict that their use will soon expand to many other industries. However, many people are not prepared for this change. Some people think that robots will replace most human jobs, but they also believe that their own jobs will remain unchanged. This is an example of an optimistic bias.

Robots are already being used in various sectors, such as construction and retail. For example, a robot developed by an Australian company can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, which would take two human bricklayers a day to do. Another robot, called Tally, can help keep supermarket shelves stocked and priced.

Advocates of robotics argue that new, high-skilled jobs will be created for technicians and programmers. Critics, on the other hand, warn that we should not underestimate the importance of human skills in the workplace.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, a leading expert on robotics, has researched how this technology is shaping the future of work. He predicts that within two years, one-third of robots will be able to work with other robots and humans safely. Within three years, many companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will have developed laws to regulate robots.

Zhang believes that many people will need to retrain to adapt to the changing job market. He also thinks that robots will have a significant impact on lower-skilled workers, who will need to find new ways to develop their skills.

In the future, we can expect to see new types of robots that will interact with us in our daily lives. This will bring new opportunities for companies, but also poses challenges, such as the need for new regulations to ensure our safety and privacy.

It is crucial that we invest in education, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM), to prepare for the robotic workforce of the future and to remain competitive in the job market.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, was asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. He replied, ""Because it's there."" This answer may inspire some people to chase their dreams, but it's also a reminder that sometimes there's no need for a deeper reason to do something. Climbing is often seen as a thrilling adventure, and people enjoy the sense of freedom it gives them.

In his book ""Games that Climbers Play"", Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores identified seven different types of climbing activities, each with its own rules. He argued that the way you climb depends on the type of game you're playing. This idea has become widely accepted in the climbing community.

For many climbers, the joy of climbing comes from the sense of freedom it gives them. However, climbing can also be restrictive, as they may be confined to a tent during bad weather. There seems to be a paradox in climbing, but some argue that the limitations can actually bring a sense of simplicity and freedom.

In his essay, US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests that we should ask ""Why do people climb?"" instead of ""Why climb?"" He believes that climbing is an innate human instinct to take risks and push ourselves to the limit. Climbing can also help us develop important virtues like courage, humility, and respect for the environment, as argued by US academic Brian Treanor.

Some climbers believe that climbing independently, without relying on others or technology, requires total commitment to the goal. This idea was challenged by expert climbers Ebert and Robinson, who claimed that solo climbs are more impressive because they are harder and riskier.

Climbing can also be a meditative experience, allowing people to be fully present in the moment. This is similar to the techniques used in Zen philosophy to achieve a state of inner peace. These aspects of climbing may be another reason why people are drawn to it.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

For over 60 years, the pianist Alfred Brendel was a prominent figure in classical music. He was a thoughtful and serious person who focused on playing and recording well-known European piano pieces. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he didn't teach much. Those who knew him well saw a playful side to his personality, but this wasn't often visible in his concerts. Brendel's life was a constant cycle of studying, traveling, and performing. Then, about 5 years ago, a 14-year-old boy named Kit Armstrong approached him after a concert and asked for lessons. Initially, Brendel wasn't interested, but something about the boy impressed him. Kit played the piano extremely well and had a great memory. Brendel was impressed by Kit's ability to listen to his own playing and make adjustments. He also noticed that Kit could learn quickly and accurately.

As Brendel is retiring from public performances, Kit is gradually becoming more well-known. However, Brendel is cautious about pushing him too hard, worried that Kit might burn out too quickly. Kit is a curious and restless person who enjoys learning new languages, playing sports, and composing music. He is also very focused and has a great sense of rhythm.

Brendel believes that Kit's ability to read music and compose his own pieces has helped him improve his skills. Kit has a remarkable memory and can learn quickly. Brendel is proud of Kit's progress, but he wants to manage expectations. He doesn't want people to put too much pressure on Kit, as this can lead to disappointment. Brendel is now 80 years old and is enjoying his post-performance life. He is still thinking about music and has many pieces he wants to play, even though he can't perform physically anymore. He finds it a pleasant new chapter in his life.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Shortened some sentences to make them easier to understand
* Removed complex vocabulary and replaced it with simpler alternatives
* Removed some of the more abstract ideas and focused on the concrete details of Brendel's life and his relationship with Kit
* Changed some of the sentence structures to make them more straightforward and easy to follow
* Removed some of the more formal language and tone to make the text more conversational.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

When I was a child, I thought all gardens were beautiful and peaceful. My grandfather's garden was special because it was near a river and had a gentle slope down to the water. You couldn't reach the river, but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds singing in the trees. I imagined that all gardens were like this - a place to escape and relax. My grandfather's garden was ordinary, with no fancy greenhouses like some of his neighbors had. Instead, they used old window frames and patched them up with plastic.

My father was a quiet and reserved person, but he had a sense of humor. He had some funny phrases he liked to use, like ""It's immaterial to me."" Deep down, he might have been disappointed that he didn't achieve more in life. He left school without qualifications and became an apprentice plumber, but he wasn't passionate about it. He was never ambitious, but he did have a talent for fixing things around the house.

My parents moved house only once, but my mother loved to redecorate and buy new furniture. She would suddenly bring home a new chair or sofa, and I would have to get used to it. The biggest change was when we got a piano. I was intimidated by it, but I liked the two brass candlesticks that stuck out from the front. My mother said they were too fancy, and they disappeared when I was at school.

I always preferred the river to the moors or woods. I loved to imagine and daydream while walking along the riverbank, looking for a spot to take off my shoes and wade into the water. I would search for fish with a net and try to catch them, but after a few failed attempts to keep them alive, I gave up.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father suggested I apply for an apprenticeship as a gardener in the Parks Department. He might have preferred it if I became a carpenter, but I think he secretly hoped that I would find a passion in gardening. Maybe he saw how much I enjoyed it and wanted me to stick with it. I like to believe that he was proud of me and my love for gardening, even if he didn't show it.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a C1 level learner:

Lawrence MacEwen is standing on his island, the Isle of Muck, and so am I. The strong Atlantic wind is making it difficult for us to stay on our feet. Suddenly, his sheepdog, Tie, appears and MacEwen strokes him gently. Despite the howling wind, he seems completely at ease here. MacEwen is showing me around his neighborhood. He points to the north and says, ""That's the island of Eigg, and the one to the west is the Isle of Rum. It gets twice as much rain as we do."" I watch the heavy clouds pouring rain on its mountains.

As we walk down the slope, MacEwen tells me more about the island. He explains that Muck is three kilometers long and half as wide, and that the geese eat a lot of grass. The MacEwens have lived here for 3,000 years. We need to move the sheep, so we start our journey. Tie, the sheepdog, is supposed to circle the flock, but he doesn't do it right. MacEwen tells him to go around the right side, but he goes straight up the middle, causing confusion.

The Isle of Muck is mostly run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, manage the farm, their son Colin runs the island cottages, and their daughter Mary runs the hotel, Port Mor, with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby love that their two boys can explore the island and sail on summer days. They only come back when they're hungry.

However, island life has its challenges. We don't always have electricity, and there's no mobile phone signal. I had to wait for the lights to turn on in my room, and Mary had to set out breakfast by torchlight. But I managed to adapt, just like most people who visit the island.

The island is full of surprises. A boat arrives with groceries and three musicians who play instruments. They perform in the tearoom, and everyone taps their feet to the music. One evening, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. Her father bought a farm on the island of Soay without even seeing it, and Jenny was sent to manage it. She had good typing skills, but no experience with farming.

I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as most of the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish, and I bring it back to her at the kitchen door. We enjoy a delicious dinner at 7 pm, and the next morning, I take the ferry to my next destination. I was worried that the ferry might not come due to high seas, but it did, and I was relieved.

The video game design industry used to be hard to get into, with few clear paths for newcomers. Many people saw it as a hobby for young enthusiasts, but now it's being taken more seriously. Industry experts agree that it's still challenging, but the industry needs talented game designers more than ever.

To get into the industry, you need to have made games. Having a degree in computer science is not necessary, but making something and having a passion for games is essential. Game design is not just a job, but a way of life.

One way to get into the industry is to start by making games. You can also consider a postgraduate course in game design, which can provide support and guidance. Many game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up.

Networking is also important. Building connections in the industry can help you get ahead. The stereotype of a young boy playing games all day is no longer accurate. Games are now a popular form of entertainment for people of all ages, and there are many opportunities for growth and learning.

The text has been simplified by:

* Using shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary
* Removing complex technical terms and jargon
* Breaking up long sentences into shorter ones
* Using more concrete and relatable examples
* Emphasizing the importance of passion and creativity in game design
* Removing the quote from Jim Donelly and replacing it with a simpler summary of his point
* Removing the quote from John Field and replacing it with a simpler summary of his point

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

I've always loved playing football since I was a child. My dad encouraged me to play, but it was my own choice. I had a friend who was pushed to play by his dad, and he eventually stopped playing. I'm glad I didn't have that experience. When I score a long-distance goal, people often say it's just luck, but I've worked hard to develop my skills. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also need years of practice. I was taught proper technique from a young age. When I'm coaching kids, I emphasize the importance of enjoying learning skills.

I was a multi-sport athlete in school, playing various sports like rounders, baseball, athletics, and basketball. Football was my passion, and I knew I wanted to pursue it professionally. I'm grateful that my teachers were supportive, even if I didn't realize it at the time.

Now, I'm trying to pass on my love for football to my son. We're already reading books together, and I hope he doesn't follow my path of focusing too much on football. When I started my professional career, our manager gave us opportunities to play for the first team without making a big fuss about it. We knew we had to work hard to prove ourselves.

I've had my share of doubts, but I've always had faith in myself and my team. I rely on my close friends and family, and I'm grateful for their support. Having a lot of money can bring its own set of challenges, but I'm careful not to let it change me. I've helped my parents financially, but I also want to use my wealth to make a positive impact on those around me.

After I retire from football, I plan to take a break and do things I've never had time for before, like going skiing. However, I'll have to wait until I'm not playing professionally, as I wouldn't be insured if I got injured.<|eot_id|>"

It was thanks to Sam Carter that we were living at Reef Point. Sam was my father's agent in Los Angeles, and he offered to find a cheap place for us to live because my father couldn't write while we were there. The beach was usually empty during the summer because of the sea fogs, but it was popular with surfers. The road to the beach was not very inviting, and there was a nearby resort called La Carmella that was more popular. However, with the hot weather, the beach became more crowded. My father was working hard to write a script by a deadline, but he was not in a good mood. I would often go to the beach with my dog, Rusty, and read a book. Rusty was a stray dog who had adopted us. One day, I gave him a bowl of water, and my father was not happy about it. Rusty loved the beach and would often dig up things and bring them to me. Sometimes, he would find things that didn't belong to him, like a new shoe or a towel, and I would have to return them to their owners. Rusty also loved to swim and would always follow me into the water, even though I could swim faster and farther than he could. After we had been swimming all day, my father left to deliver the script to Los Angeles, and Rusty and I stayed on the beach to watch the surfers. One surfer in particular caught my eye because of her excellent skills. She asked me why I didn't join the surfers, and I told her I didn't have a surfboard. She suggested I buy one, but I didn't have the money. She asked if I was British and visiting, and I told her I lived there. She asked about my father, and I told her he was writing a film script based on a novel he had written. She seemed interested when I mentioned the title ""Tall as the Morning"", and we started talking about it.

Here is a simplified version of the passage, suitable for a C1 level learner:

Violet Hetherington was frustrated as she stood in the long queue at the dock in Southampton. She had been advised by her friend Annie to arrive late, but it seemed that was the wrong strategy today. The computer system had broken down, causing the queues to grow longer and more impatient. 

As Violet waited, she felt her anxiety grow. She had paid a lot of money for this cruise and was worried that it wouldn't live up to her expectations. To make matters worse, she had left her phone behind and couldn't contact the minicab company to check if it was still there. 

Behind her in the queue, Violet met a friendly couple who lent her their phone to make an emergency call to her son Harry. She asked him to ask their neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was still at her flat. 

As the queues finally started to move, Violet felt a sense of relief. She handed over her travel documents and boarded the ship. The foyer was impressive, with its shiny fake walnut panels, chandeliers, and polished brass. However, Violet was disappointed to find that the elevators were crowded and cramped, with mirrors lining the walls. 

Finally, she reached her room on the 12th floor and was relieved to find that it had a balcony, just as she had requested. She had been worried about what to say if it didn't have one, but now she could relax. Despite Annie's advice to wait for a last-minute deal, Violet had paid the highest price she could afford to ensure she got the sea view she wanted.

John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction, unaware that he was about to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier, a talented street photographer. Maier's photos were meant to be used in a book about the history of the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, but what Maloof found was 30,000 images by Maier, capturing everyday life on the streets. Since then, Maloof has gathered an extensive archive of Maier's work, including cameras, film, prints, negatives, and videos.

Maloof has been working with his friend Anthony Rydzon to learn more about Maier's life and work. They have spoken to people who knew her, including families she worked for as a nanny and employees at the photo development shop. Maier was born in New York in 1926 and spent her childhood in France. She moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny and was known for carrying a camera with her everywhere she went.

Maier was a private person, but she was not afraid to take pictures of people and engage with them. She was passionate about art, movies, and politics, and her photographs reflect this. Her work is unique and has not been done for commercial purposes. Maloof has been inspired by her architectural shots and has started taking his own photos, realizing that Maier's true focus was on people, street scenes, and composition.

Now, Maloof and Rydzon are working to share Maier's work with the world and get her recognized as a talented photographer.<|eot_id|>"

Eleanor Catton's book, The Luminaries, is a remarkable novel that has received a lot of attention. I had the opportunity to interview her in the UK, where she was still basking in the success of her book. Despite being in her twenties, she seemed very calm and collected. She told me a funny story about being stopped at passport control and being asked to prove she was a writer. She showed the official her novel and was asked what it was about. This is not an easy question for an author!

The Luminaries is set in New Zealand in the 1860s. A group of 12 men have gathered to solve a series of crimes. The plot becomes very complex, with many characters and twists. Catton started writing a murder mystery, but found that the historical setting offered many opportunities for complications and misunderstandings. The book is over 800 pages long, which is necessary to give each of the 20 main characters a fair share of the story.

When I asked her about her success at such a young age, she downplayed it, saying that it's nice to be successful from a small country like New Zealand, where everyone feels like they have a part in it. She also mentioned that she was annoyed when people assumed that her book wasn't trying to explore deeper themes.

Catton explained that she wanted to write a book with a unique structure, with each part getting shorter than the previous one. She wanted to create a book that had hidden patterns and codes that readers could discover if they looked closely. Despite the complex structure, the book remains an exciting murder mystery with a compelling plot.

When I asked if she had planned out the book beforehand, she said she didn't. Instead, she would write herself into a difficult situation and then try to find a creative way out of it. She also wanted to make the book enjoyable for readers. We talked about her love of TV dramas, which also feature cliffhangers and multiple viewpoints. She seemed open to the idea of writing for TV, but for now, she plans to stay in New Zealand, where she finds inspiration in the landscape and the people.

Jonny Kinkead has been making guitars for over 40 years. As a child, he was fascinated by music and building things with his father's tools. He started playing the guitar at 11 and later built his own bass guitar at 16. Jonny's passion for guitar-making was sparked by his desire to create something beautiful and unique. He learned about the different types of wood and how they affect the sound, and he experimented with different combinations to create distinct tones.

Jonny's early career was not straightforward. He studied architecture in university but dropped out halfway through, realizing it wasn't the right fit for him. He then focused on his guitar-making skills and eventually started building guitars as a living. Initially, he sold his guitars for the cost of the materials, but as his reputation grew, he was able to charge more.

Jonny believes that building a career as a guitar-maker requires a combination of skills and self-taught experimentation. He emphasizes the importance of learning from others, but also the need to try new things and make mistakes. He suggests that new guitar-makers should take advantage of available courses and training, but also be willing to take risks and learn through trial and error.

Today, Jonny is still making guitars, but he acknowledges that his production is limited to about 10 guitars a year. Despite the challenges, he is content with his decision to pursue his passion and is proud of the reputation he has built as a skilled guitar-maker.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

When discussing English conversations, it's common to start by talking about the weather. This is because, as the 18th-century diarist Dr. Johnson noted, when two English people meet, they often talk about the weather first. This observation is still true today.

Many writers have tried to explain why English people are so interested in the weather, but they often get it wrong. They assume that English people are fascinated by the weather itself, but that's not the case. The truth is that conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all. Instead, they're a way for English people to break the ice and start talking to each other.

In England, the weather is not particularly exciting or dramatic. It's often grey and rainy, and there are no extreme weather conditions like tornadoes or hurricanes. So, English people don't talk about the weather because they're interested in it, but because it's a way to connect with others. It's a form of ""grooming talk,"" like when monkeys and apes groom each other to strengthen their social bonds.

There are specific situations where English people use weather talk. They might use it as a greeting, to break the ice and start a conversation. They might also use it as a way to fill an awkward silence or to transition to a different topic. This can make it seem like English people talk about the weather all the time, but really, it's just a way to build relationships and connect with others.

Alice Leader was standing in front of the remains of Hadrian's Wall in Britain, explaining to her students what an impressive achievement it was for the Romans to build a 120-kilometer-long and 5-meter-high wall over 1,900 years ago. She had already sparked their interest, as they had chosen this trip over other popular destinations. However, the students wanted to know why the wall was built. Alice felt her answers were not satisfying, so she decided to write a historical novel to add context and human interest to life at the wall during Roman times. After retiring from teaching after 31 years, Alice started her second career as an author in 2001. She had a successful teaching career, but writing was a new and exciting challenge. Alice's goal is to write novels that fill a gap in children's fiction. She believes that many modern children's books focus on negative experiences or fantasy, but her books are different. Alice always tried to connect English and History lessons, and her love for children motivates her to write. She sees her writing as an extension of teaching, and her goal is to engage children and make them interested in learning.

Alice was inspired to write her first novel because of a gap in the market, but also because her sons were leaving home and she was considering her future. Her head teacher recommended a creative writing course, which she initially resisted but eventually took. The course was a turning point for her, and she was encouraged to publish her work.

To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, professional triathletes, to participate in a unique competition. The brothers would race to the same point, but Jonny would do it by car on the roads, while Alistair would ride a mountain bike across country. Jonny was excited about the challenge, saying, ""I've never done anything like this before. The roads are beautiful, and it's very cold, so I'll be able to stay warm in the car."" Alistair was also looking forward to it, despite wearing full winter cycling gear. He joked that he might stop for a cup of tea halfway up the hill because he was confident that his brother's driving skills were not the best.

The race started at Semerwater Lake in Wensleydale and ended at Yorkshire's highest road, Fleet Moss, which is 350 meters above sea level. Alistair's first few miles involved a steep 25% incline, making it a tough start. The brothers shook hands and then started their journey. Alistair rode his bike up the hill and across the countryside, while Jonny drove his car on the road. They wouldn't see each other again until the finish line.

Jonny's early confidence was quickly shaken when he encountered a giant tractor on the road. He joked to the cameraman that if Alistair won, it would be because of the farmer. Alistair, on the other hand, struggled with the steep slope, eventually having to carry his bike up the hill and over fences. He was determined to keep going, despite the challenges.

After reaching the summit, Alistair was able to pick up speed and ride down the other side. Jonny faced another obstacle when he had to navigate a narrow road and cross a stream.

When you play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, the silence is what strikes you. The soft grass, the rich history, and the ancient stadium all combine to create a peaceful atmosphere. This silence helps me focus on my game. As I play, I block out everything else and concentrate on the point I'm playing.

The silence is broken only by the applause and cheers of the crowd after each point. But even that sounds distant, as if it's coming from somewhere far away. I'm so focused that I don't even realize there are 15,000 people watching me, or that millions are watching around the world.

I've always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My coach, my uncle Toni, has told me since I was young that this is the biggest tournament. Before 2008, I had played and lost twice to Roger Federer in the final. The defeat in 2007 was particularly tough. I was devastated and felt like I had let myself down.

My coach, Toni, is usually tough and doesn't offer much comfort. But after my loss in 2007, he surprised me by saying there would be more Wimbledons and more chances to win. He told me not to cry, that I would learn from my mistakes.

Jane Goodall, a young and idealistic Englishwoman, arrived in Africa in 1957 and wrote to her family that she had found the Africa she had always dreamed of. She spent most of her life in Africa and became a renowned scientist, journalist, and environmentalist. Her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees made her a famous figure, and she wrote several books, including the bestseller ""In the Shadow of Man"".

However, despite her fame, many people have misunderstood her achievements. She is often portrayed as an adventurous girl who loves animals, a determined feminist, and so on. But her actual accomplishments are often overlooked. In reality, Jane Goodall is a pioneering zoologist who has made significant contributions to our understanding of chimpanzees.

Before Goodall's research, no one knew that chimpanzees ate meat, used tools, or had similar emotions to humans. Her long-term study of wild chimpanzees in Tanzania's Gombe National Park has been called one of the greatest scientific achievements of the Western world. Her work has changed the way we study animals and has also changed our understanding of ourselves.

Jane Goodall's passion for animals began at a young age. When she was just five years old, she crawled into a henhouse to figure out how hens lay eggs. This curiosity and determination have driven her to become one of the most celebrated scientists of the 20th century.

Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist who can mimic many different voices. She can sound like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an elderly Scottish woman, and even a fast-talking alien. She has done voiceovers for various projects, including educational videos, cartoons, and advertisements. Shirley believes that doing voiceovers is not just about making funny voices, but also about bringing the script to life for the audience.

Many actors think they can do voiceovers, but Shirley says it takes more than just making funny voices. You need to be able to make the script come alive and engage the audience. Shirley has worked with many household names who wanted to do voiceovers, but didn't get the parts because they were used to acting with their whole bodies.

Shirley started her career in drama school, where she did some occasional work singing jingles for TV adverts. She then landed a role in a cartoon as a rabbit, which was a surprise to her. She realized she could do voices and decided to focus on voiceover work.

Shirley has learned to create different voices by watching children's TV and collecting new voices. She has worked on a range of projects, from educational videos to vacuum cleaner adverts. She says the key is to sound enthusiastic, even when talking about something you don't care about. She has also learned to smile while talking, which makes her voice sound bright and cheerful.

The competition for voiceover work is fierce, so it's essential to have a good showreel, which is a recording that demonstrates what you can do. Shirley recommends investing in a strong showreel and attending specialist workshops to learn more about voiceover work. She believes that having a passion for human sound is fundamental and that she has become obsessed with voices and characters.

Shirley's children are used to their mum talking in different voices, even when she's not recording. She says that sometimes, after doing a particular voice, she will continue to speak in that voice for hours or even days.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Many people ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's understandable, as cartooning is a dream job that many people have as children. However, most people grow up and choose more realistic careers, like being a lawyer or working in industry. The idea of making a living by drawing simple doodles is unusual, but some people do manage to do it. 

I became a cartoonist after studying graphic design in college and then showing my work to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted to publish my political cartoons. With time, I was able to support myself through my work. 

Becoming a cartoonist doesn't require a university degree, a lot of money, or even great drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to make marks. However, it's a challenging job, and you need to be passionate about it. 

I've worked on various projects, including political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also been a writer, caricaturist, and designer. I believe that the more skills you have, the more chance you have of making a living from your art. 

In the past, many cartoonists could find regular jobs working for newspapers and magazines. However, nowadays, cartooning is often an entrepreneurial activity, which means you need to produce and sell your work yourself. The more comfortable you are with the business side of things, the better you'll do. 

I've seen many cartoonists with average creative skills but excellent business skills do well, while those with great artistic talent but poor business skills struggle. Some people are so worried about someone stealing their ideas that they don't even show their work to others. However, all you need to do to protect your work is add a 'c' for 'copyright' and your name and date. 

It's more realistic that no one will be interested in your work, but if someone does steal it and it becomes popular, it can be a lucky break!<|eot_id|>"

Twenty years ago, I was moving and decided to get rid of some old things. I threw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. I was surprised because I usually don't get rid of things easily. The guitar was a sleek, black Japanese model. I took it to the dump and was about to throw it away when a young man approached me, looking puzzled. 'You're not going to throw that away, are you?' he asked. I said I was, but he asked if he could have it and I agreed. After that, I felt a pang of regret.

Years later, I received an email from a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He had found my guitar and was offering to sell it back to me. I was amazed and felt a mix of emotions. It turned out that the guitar had been sold several times since I got rid of it. Keith had found a label on the back with my name and address and used it to track me down.

I had forgotten that my dad used to put labels on all my belongings, including my guitar. He had wanted me to learn classical guitar, but I struggled and switched to electric guitar instead. I loved the sound of the electric guitar and enjoyed playing it.

When I received the guitar back from Keith, I was surprised by how small it felt and how smooth it was to play. My fingers knew where to go, and I could play chords without thinking. The electric guitar is not a solo instrument, and I think I might need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, and we could play together. Maybe there are other people my age who have had a similar experience, and we could call ourselves 'The Regainers'!

* Removed complex vocabulary and phrases, such as ""a constant, aching sorrow"", ""vaguely remembered a story"", and ""it was all I could do not to burst into tears"".

There has been a lot of talk about the importance of sleep lately. When I wrote my book about insomnia, I realized that sleep is crucial for our mental, physical, and social well-being. People who struggle with sleep know how important it is, but what about dreams? We often cut off the last hour or two of sleep, which is the most dream-rich stage of sleep. This stage is when we have our most vivid, memorable, and emotionally powerful dreams.

Researchers have been studying dreams for a long time, and they have found that dreams are important for our brain function. When we dream, our brain processes and connects different pieces of information in new and creative ways. This is why dreams can be so vivid and memorable.

Some people, like artists and writers, seem to use their dreams more than others. They often report that their dreams inspire their creativity and help them come up with new ideas. However, dreams are not just for artists. We all need to think creatively and flexibly in our daily lives, whether it's at work or in our personal relationships. So, it's important to understand the role of dreams in our brain function and how they can help us be more creative and innovative.

In conclusion, sleep and dreams are closely linked, and we need to make sure we get enough sleep to allow ourselves to dream. By understanding the importance of dreams, we can tap into our creative potential and improve our overall well-being.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small coastal town in southwest England. Her studio has an incredible view of the sea, and as you enter, you'll see many empty frames on the walls, surrounded by happy photos of her two daughters. You might expect a renowned copyist artist like Susie to have her own artwork on display, but she doesn't. This is because she finishes each piece and sells it immediately. Susie has spent 30 years copying famous paintings by artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her reproductions are so accurate that art experts often mistake them for the originals. While the originals would sell for millions, Susie's copies can fetch anywhere from a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on the time she spends on each piece.

Susie's clients include galleries and private collectors, some of whom are genuine art lovers, while others value the status that comes with owning a famous painting. Some even display Susie's copies as originals, which is up to them. Susie is honest about what she does and makes sure her reproductions look as authentic as possible. She signs each piece on the back of the canvas to avoid any confusion.

Susie hasn't always been a copyist. After graduating from art school, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden, where she developed her attention to detail and passion for plants. She eventually found a more rewarding career as a copyist, which allows her to use her skills to reproduce masterpieces.

When younger artists approach Susie for advice, she stresses the importance of learning to draw accurately and studying extensively to achieve her level of skill. She specializes in reproducing French impressionist paintings, which she finds challenging due to the combination of quick brushstrokes and attention to detail required.

Some people might wonder why Susie doesn't create her own original art, given her skills. However, she believes her reproductions are the result of years of training and dedication, and she makes a good living from them. She has tried creating her own art, but it didn't turn out as well as she had hoped. Perhaps it's like trying to cook a meal after a lifetime of eating in a top restaurant – it's hard to replicate the expertise of a master.

The key to Susie's success is her perfectionism.<|eot_id|>"

Ellen MacArthur's passion was sailing, and she was obsessed with being the fastest on the water. She spent most of her childhood and adult life sailing around the world, often for weeks or even months at a time. After one particularly challenging solo voyage, she realized that her love for the sea was not just about racing, but about the connection she felt with nature and the importance of taking care of the planet.

Ellen believes that humans have a tendency to take resources for granted and use them up without thinking about the consequences. She sees the world as a fragile and limited resource, like a boat that needs to be maintained and protected. She has been touring factories, mines, and power stations, talking to governments and businesses about the need to switch to renewable energy sources.

Ellen has also founded a charity, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, which aims to educate young people about sustainability and help them design a better future. She believes that everyone has a role to play in protecting the planet, and that small changes can make a big difference.

Ellen misses the sense of adventure and connection to nature that she felt while sailing, but she believes that her new mission is even more important. She says, ""I used to think that being the fastest person around the world was the most important thing, but now I realize that it's about finding ways to make a positive impact on the world.""

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to climb Mount Everest, which would make him the youngest person to do so. He hopes to inspire other young people to spend more time outdoors and get involved in adventure activities. Jordan's team, which includes his parents, Paul and Karen, is planning to climb the Seven Summits, the highest points on each continent. If they succeed, Jordan will be the youngest person to achieve this feat.

Many experienced climbers think it's not a good idea to take a 13-year-old up Mount Everest. They worry that Jordan might not be emotionally strong enough for the challenge and might not have enough experience to make good decisions. Jordan's parents have heard these concerns before, but they are confident in their own experience and in Jordan's abilities. They believe that Jordan is becoming stronger and more responsible every day.

Some people might think that Jordan's father, Paul, is being too ambitious and that he's pushing his son to take unnecessary risks. However, Paul says that this project is not about him becoming famous because of his son's achievements. He and his wife are making sure that Jordan is motivated to continue and that he's not just doing it for the sake of setting a record.

Jordan's motivation is to achieve his goal, and he enjoys the challenge. However, he also knows that he needs to be careful about how he presents himself to the media and the public. He has to be willing to blog, take photos, and give interviews to inspire others. But if he ever loses his motivation or decides to stop climbing, his parents will stop the project and support him in finding a new activity that he enjoys.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Simplified vocabulary: I replaced complex vocabulary with simpler alternatives, such as ""adventure activities"" instead of ""climbing their own mountains"" and ""achievement"" instead of ""record-setting challenge"".
* Shortened sentences: I broke up long sentences into shorter ones to make them easier to follow.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 learner:

Many people assume that teenagers listen to pop music, and it's true that few know about classical music. Even those who study music, like me, may not be familiar with classical music. The statistics are concerning: only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells only 300 copies. So, why has classical music lost its appeal to most people, especially teenagers? The truth is that classical music doesn't resonate with many young people. As a musician, I play in an orchestra, but I don't particularly enjoy classical music myself. I prefer a variety of styles, but my music collection is probably similar to the 3% figure.

So, why don't teenagers like classical music? One reason is that it's slow-paced and has many mood changes, which can be difficult to follow. We're used to fast-paced conversations, games, and thinking. Additionally, classical music requires attention and concentration, which can be challenging for us. Pop music is simple and easy to follow, while classical music demands more effort. The subject matter of pop music is also more relatable to teenagers, as it often deals with issues that concern us. Classical music, on the other hand, is more formal and lacks the same appeal.

The way we consume music has also changed. In the past, families would make music together, and playing an instrument was valued. Nowadays, we can access any music online, and classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music playing in a shop or at a public event? Some argue that classical music is more popular among older people, but I think it's unlikely that many teenagers attend classical concerts. In my orchestra, we play in various settings, but the audience is usually older.

Some people blame schools for the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers, but this isn't entirely true. Many students enjoy playing classical music in their school orchestra, but it's not their preferred choice for relaxation. The two activities have become separate. When we want to unwind, we often turn to pop music.

Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother's car and looked at Almonside School. 'I'll make you sorry I came here,' she said, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the other door, so didn't hear her. Bonnie didn't care if she had. Her mother knew how she felt.

Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside School was unusual, with buildings hidden among trees on a hillside. It was confusing at first, but then she saw signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre... 'Riding centre,' Bonnie said, showing interest. 'Headmaster's study,' her mother said. 'This way.' Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between trees.

Her mother talked to the headmaster in his study while Bonnie waited outside. Bonnie suddenly stood up. 'Why should I just sit here?' she thought. 'I'll be leaving soon anyway, so why not get it over with?' She left the building and went to the riding centre. There was a nice old building with horses and a large indoor riding arena. Bonnie looked around, but no one was there. She approached the horses with respect. The horses were well taken care of, and she could tell that.

Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, looking at each horse and judging it. 'I know what they're doing here,' she told a small pony, touching its nose. It was the next horse that caught her attention. 'You're the best of the lot!' she said. He was brown with a white patch. Bonnie liked that. 'I feel like we've met before,' she said, stroking his neck. 'In my dreams, I was riding you in a big competition...' Over the stall was his name: Maverick. She couldn't resist the urge to ride him. 'I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle... Can't be far away.' The room with all the riding equipment was unlocked. She forgot about her mother and the headmaster as she put a saddle on Maverick's back. When she sat on him outside, she felt like a queen, in charge of everything she saw. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. 'You're the best horse I've ever ridden, Maverick,' she said, admiringly. 'And when I say that, I'm not joking... I know about horses, even if I don't know about anything else.' She nudged him into a walk, then a trot. 'If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,' she said. She rode around the paddock, feeling exhilarated, the wind whipping past her cheek. She knew Maverick trusted her, and she felt certain he'd jump well.

I've met Cody Simpson before and I've always been impressed by his calm and confident personality. At just 15, he has already released many successful songs. So, how did a laid-back surfer boy end up performing in front of thousands of fans? Cody started playing the guitar at the age of six and writing songs at seven. However, he was also passionate about swimming and surfing, and these activities took up most of his time. When he was 13, he started posting videos online, singing with his friends at school concerts. The response was overwhelming, and soon he was recording more videos at home. Record labels took notice, and Cody had to make a difficult decision: continue swimming in Australia or take a risk and move to the US with his family. He chose the latter, leaving behind his swimming career and friends. Cody says it was tough to make this choice at such a young age, especially when it came to choosing a career. He had to break the news to his swimming coach and friends, who were all surprised. Cody's family has always been supportive, and he values keeping a close circle of people around him. He acknowledges that he sometimes worries about the impact his decision has had on his younger brother and sister, who have had to adjust to a non-traditional life on the road. However, his family reassures him that they are always there to support him. Cody's success is a reminder that taking risks and saying 'yes' to opportunities can lead to amazing experiences. 'It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,' he says. 'Now, I get to perform in countries I never thought I'd visit, and in front of huge crowds.

I woke up early and looked out the window. The river was frozen, but there was a crack in the ice where the sunlight was shining through. I remembered helping my neighbors and friends to build sandbags to protect the town from flooding as the ice melted. My back still ached from the hard work. I put on my wetsuit and went to the river to check if everything was okay. As I was getting ready, I saw a boy on the other side of the river trying to balance on a thin piece of ice. I was worried about him and decided to go and help.

I checked my lucky chain, which my famous grandfather had given me, and put it in my pocket. I also brought my diary, which he had written during one of his expeditions. I like to read it before I go to sleep. My mom was in the kitchen making breakfast. She wished me good luck and told me to be careful. I said goodbye and headed out to the river.

As I was leaving, I ran into my grandfather. He's been a bit grumpy lately, and we didn't get along very well. He asked me what I was doing and why I was wasting my time training for kayaking competitions. I tried to ignore his criticism and went to the river anyway. My mom came out and tried to make me feel better. She said not to mind my grandfather's behavior and that he's going through a tough time.

I went to the river and started my training session. I love kayaking and hope to one day go on an expedition to South America. I'm trying to find sponsors to help me make it happen.

Jess shook her head. 'I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on something.' Jess looked at the painting. It was a river, but not a real one. The riverbank was almost invisible, and the eye was drawn to the pale waters. There were no animals, people, or birds. The painting felt strange and beautiful. Jess was captivated, thinking of autumn after a long summer. Mum said, 'It's got a name.' There was something in her voice that betrayed her enthusiasm. Jess knew why. Grandpa never gave his paintings names. Mum turned the painting over and showed Jess the words written on the back. 'River Boy.' Jess read it aloud. The words seemed important, but she didn't know why. There was a mystery. Jess looked at Mum. 'There is no boy.' 'Exactly. It's strange for him to be so specific. Maybe he'll add the boy later.' Mum had asked Grandpa about it, but he didn't explain. He said that each painting has its own life and language, and we either understand it or we don't. He also said that artists should focus on their work and not waste time explaining their paintings to everyone.

I was trying to fit a small cabinet into a corner of my room, but it didn't fit. The cabinet was given to me by my grandmother, and I really like it. It's small, white, and has pink and blue flowers on it. My grandmother used to keep special china ornaments in it, and now I keep my own collection of shells, fossils, and stones there.

The problem was that the cabinet was shaped like a triangle, and my room only has two corners. My room is small and under the roof, and it's shaped like a wedge of cheese. My siblings have bigger rooms, but mine is cozy and I like it. The only issue is that there aren't many corners to put things in. I tried to fit the cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was too tall. Then I thought, why not cut a hole in the carpet? It seemed like a good idea at the time, but now I'm not so sure. My dad would probably call it ""thinking outside the box,"" but I'm not sure he would be happy with me if he knew what I did.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live in the walls and floors of a house and take things from the people who live there without them noticing. When I was asked to adapt the novel for TV, I knew it would be difficult to meet people's expectations. Those who love the book have strong ideas about how it should be done. To avoid disagreements, I used the original drawings from the book as a guide. The author wanted the series to be told from the Borrowers' perspective, not from a human one, which made filming more complex. The most important thing was to get the scale right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so we had to film them from a distance ten times greater than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from a very low angle to get the Borrowers' perspective. We never raised the cameras above their height except for aerial shots.

One of the biggest challenges was making the shadows look right when the tiny Borrowers were combined with the ordinary-sized surroundings. We developed a special technique for this. After the series was shown, a famous film director, George Lucas, even called me to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. It was a surreal experience. When I asked the actors to carry giant objects, they really got into character. I remember the coins - they were as big as dinner plates and hard to lift. We often had to stop filming because the crew laughed so much.

In the story, the Borrowers are swept down a drain. To film this, the actors had to be swept down a tunnel with the hoses, and they said it was a frightening experience. They didn't even have to act - they were that scared. Getting the costumes right was also important. I had them made from heavy canvas material so they looked like dolls' clothes. This made it difficult for the leading actress to bend or sit down, and she couldn't even take off her dress as it was sewn on every morning. The trousers worn by the lead actor were made from a rug, as normal fabric would have looked too smooth. Unfortunately, it was very hot during filming, and I don't think they thanked me for my attention to detail with those costumes!

Most of the action that took place away from the Borrowers' home had to be filmed with the actors separated from their surroundings. We filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was challenging for them to react to things that weren't there. I had to draw pictures of every scene myself to show people how each one should look - I did 2,000 of them by the end. They weren't perfect, but they worked well enough. We had to work hard and fast - I even shot a whole scene before realising there was no film in the camera! But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was successful in capturing the magic of the books.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

American teenagers are expected to excel in many areas: being the Student Council president, having a part-time job, volunteering, and achieving good grades. They are under a lot of pressure, with heavy workloads, many extracurricular activities, and responsibilities at home. Many people, including adults, forget how stressful this can be. Despite this, some people still have negative stereotypes about teenagers, thinking they are lazy, disrespectful, and self-absorbed.

However, many teenagers disagree. They believe that these stereotypes are unfair and that they are not as glued to their phones and TVs as people think. In fact, they use their phones to make their lives easier and to stay connected with others. With the rise of smartphones, tablets, and social media, students can now access information and do their homework anywhere, anytime.

Teenagers have busy schedules, often starting their day early and ending late at night. They may not get the recommended nine hours of sleep and may even fall asleep in school due to sleep deprivation. Despite this, many teenagers make time for volunteer work and other activities that benefit others.

One teenager, Lindamarie Olsen, thinks that the stereotype of teenagers being selfish is not true. She believes that many teenagers are focused on making a positive impact in their communities. In the future, who knows what the stereotype of teenagers will be, but it is likely that they will continue to prove it wrong and make a positive difference in the world.

The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in and around Bishop, a small town in the US surrounded by wilderness. Over the past few years, they have launched over 50 balloons to the edge of space, about 35 km above the Earth's surface. This is a unique science project that combines astronomy and adventure. I joined them on a weekend in late spring to see their latest launch. They were about to send a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars. These occur when a rock or piece of metal enters the Earth's atmosphere, creating a trail of light.

As it got dark, the teenagers attached a lunch box to the bottom of the balloon. Inside the box was a camera, an altitude meter, and a thermometer to measure the changes during the ascent. Two GPS trackers were attached to the outside to help them find the box later. A gas tank, donated by a local enthusiast, was used to inflate the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car.

The team chanted ""Five, four, three, two, one"" and the balloon took off. Some of them followed its path with powerful flashlights, watching it disappear into the night. There was a sense of collective wonder and excitement.

After the launch, most of the students went home, but a few stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside and gazed at the incredibly clear sky. I saw a boy fall asleep in his sleeping bag. ""We're the only ones talking,"" one girl whispered. ""I know,"" whispered another. A meteor shot across the sky.

As the balloon rose, the air pressure decreased and the balloon expanded, eventually popping in a dramatic explosion. A parachute helped the equipment land safely back on Earth. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers.

Recovering the lunch box was not easy, but that was part of the adventure. The team had to drive south and then back up the mountain range to reach the landing site. They had to decide whether to drive or walk, as the terrain could be challenging. The leader noted that the students were familiar with this landscape, which was normal for them.

In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box, which was located in a canyon, on a flat rock, near a waterfall. Unfortunately, the camera didn't record any shooting stars. However, it was an opportunity to discuss the effects of atmospheric waves and mountain ridges. And it was another exciting story to share with others.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 learner:

Chloe Morgan didn't always find science interesting, especially not palaeontology. However, everything changed when she was 15. Her younger brother was going through a dinosaur phase, and she reluctantly helped him with a science project. When she read about recent discoveries in the field, she was amazed and decided to pursue it further.

Chloe remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was very approachable and willing to listen to her questions. This experience encouraged her to continue her interest in palaeontology.

I ask her about the portrayal of palaeontologists in movies and TV shows. Chloe thinks that films like Jurassic Park have sparked a lot of interest in dinosaurs, but they often portray palaeontologists in a misleading way. In her opinion, these depictions are either stereotyped as eccentric geniuses or awkward, socially inept individuals.

Chloe explains that her job is varied and includes excavating dinosaur bones, analyzing fossils, and writing scientific papers. She also spends time communicating scientific findings to the public, which she believes is important. She emphasizes the need to correct misconceptions about science and to encourage young people to learn about all aspects of science.

Chloe was involved in a recent TV documentary, Walking with Dinosaurs, where she provided advice to ensure that the dinosaurs depicted were accurate. She is proud of the programme, which attracted a wide audience and presented dinosaurs in a more realistic way.

Chloe thinks that dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they tap into our sense of adventure and curiosity. They remind us that there is still much to be discovered in the world, and palaeontology is a way to explore the past and travel through time.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

When you're on a long car trip with your family, you probably know that you're not there yet, even when you ask ""Are we there yet?"" repeatedly. In fact, once you finally arrive, it's no longer ""there"" but ""here"". So, it's more accurate to ask ""Are we here yet?"" But let's be honest, parents are the ones who get tired of answering this question over and over. As a child, wouldn't you rather be relaxing in the back seat, watching movies, listening to music, or doing puzzles while taking in the scenery outside? And your parents will be busy making sure everything runs smoothly, like a hotel concierge on wheels.

But sometimes, things can get chaotic. For example, my brother Tim would often put his foot on my side of the seat, and I would retaliate, and soon we'd be fighting. Our parents would have to intervene, telling us to stay in our own seats and keep our hands to ourselves. After a while, the tension would subside, and we'd continue the journey. Sometimes, I'd try to read, but then I'd feel a cold breeze on my arm. I'd look around, and it would be my brother, blowing on me discreetly. It was a small thing, but it would make me angry. My parents would have to calm us down, and we'd continue the trip.

Over the years, my dad developed some clever ways to deal with us kids on long car rides. For instance, he'd respond to ""Are we there yet?"" with ""Yes, we're here. Get out of the car."" But if we pointed out that we were still on the highway, he'd say, ""Well, maybe we're not there yet."" That would keep us quiet for a while. You know you're finally ""there"" when you see the grown-ups get out of the car and try to get away from the kids who've been driving them crazy for hours. So, to sum it up, if your parents are still near enough to answer your question, the answer is no – you're not there yet.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford where people can play board games while enjoying a cup of coffee and a cake. They want customers to have a great time and come back again. Zuzi explains why they started this business: 'We want people to put down their phones and be together. We're social beings and we need to communicate with each other.'

The games they play are called 'Eurogames'. These games are known for their gentle themes, such as building farms or landscapes. The first Eurogame was 'The Settlers of Catan', created by a German designer. Players work together to build settlements and trade resources, making the game exciting and engaging until the end.

Another popular Eurogame is 'Pandemic', where players work together to solve global problems. The game was inspired by 'Lord of the Rings', a book and movie series. The game designer, Matt Leacock, wanted to create a game that would bring people together and make them feel good, whether they won or lost.

Leacock started playing board games as a child, but often felt disappointed when they didn't turn out as expected. He then began designing his own games with the help of his uncle. 'Pandemic' was a huge success, and its sequel introduced even more storytelling elements.

The growth of video games has actually helped the popularity of board games. Many people are now comfortable playing games on their phones, which has made them more open to playing board games with others. John and Zuzi's café is a great example of this trend, as people come together to play games and socialize in person.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 learner:

Jamie Scott is a successful songwriter and producer in the UK music industry. His story shows that perseverance and determination are crucial in the music business, even when you face many setbacks. Scott's mother was an amazing singer and introduced him to music from an early age. He grew up listening to local radio stations that played middle-aged music, which influenced his taste in music. Scott started playing the guitar at 12 and was torn between pursuing tennis, which he was good at, and music. He eventually chose music and spent his lunchtimes at school practicing on the piano.

At 17, Scott left school to pursue a career in music. He formed a duo with a friend, but they didn't share the same passion for performing. Scott's parents gave him an ultimatum: he had 18 months to make it in the music industry, or he would have to get a job. After several near-misses with record labels, Scott was signed to a music publisher at 19. However, he was only interested in working as a solo artist, so he had to part ways with his friend.

Scott found success behind the scenes, rather than on stage. He wrote for other artists and became one of the most sought-after songwriters in the UK. He believes that writing catchy, chart-topping songs is nothing to be ashamed of. In fact, he thinks it's a natural goal for any songwriter. Scott's approach is refreshing in an industry where many people pretend to be humble. He simply knows what he wants and has the talent to achieve it.

When working with other artists, Scott's goal is to create music that is both amazing and commercially successful. He believes that the best songs are those that can appeal to a wide audience and become classics. Scott's approach is straightforward: he wants to write the best music possible, regardless of what others think.

Tony Connor is a famous street trials cyclist, known for doing incredible stunts on his bike. He jumps from one impossible spot to another and films it all on his camera. I met him at a BMX park on a Saturday morning, and many people recognized him and praised him as a legend. I was surprised by his courage and willingness to take risks. Despite being famous online, Tony is not fond of the social side of being a celebrity and prefers to focus on his stunts rather than talking about them.

Tony's online fame is due to social media and lightweight camera technology. He is grateful for this opportunity to make a living from his passion. However, he is not a fan of people constantly filming themselves or staring at screens. He believes that his ability to make a living from his hobby is a result of this technology.

I have learned that two important factors contribute to becoming an elite competitor: energy and the ability to overcome disappointment. Tony has both of these qualities, which help him persist in the face of failure. He is not always seen as a hero, as some people think he is reckless and takes unnecessary risks. Tony disagrees, saying that people who make these accusations don't understand the sport and the risks involved.

Tony is not reckless; he takes his time to plan and prepare for each stunt. He knows the dangers and is aware of his own fears, but he finds ways to overcome them. He is not addicted to risk and only attempts stunts when he is fully prepared and focused.

Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on many challenging tasks for charity. For her latest adventure, she walked along a thin metal wire, 66 meters above the ground, between two power station towers. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to a wire above. To help her balance, she carried a heavy stick. Helen took lessons from an expert high-wire walker to learn how to do it safely. She found it was much harder than she expected. ""The training was a shock,"" she said. ""I didn't realize how strong I would need to be. Every day, I had to run up a steep hill, do exercises, and practice on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall onto the wire so I could continue walking if I slipped. It hurt every time I fell, but it was essential to stay positive. If I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would shake too!""

On the day of the challenge, it was windy, but Helen stayed calm by taking deep breaths as she walked along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. ""That was the scariest thing I've ever done,"" she said afterwards. ""I'm glad it's over!"" Despite the experience, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, kitesurfing, and biking.

In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a unique bicycle called a penny farthing. He had already written a book about his adventures traveling across Canada in an old car and was passionate about motor sports. To save money, Jeff used his old bicycle to commute to work and even took it on holiday to Amsterdam. This trip opened his eyes to the idea of traveling the world by bike. Jeff wanted a special bike, so he decided to build one himself. He chose a penny farthing because it was the most unusual one he could think of. After two attempts in 2001 and 2003, which were unsuccessful due to a knee injury, Jeff finally set out on his journey in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The highlight of his trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. Although he met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, Jeff never regretted his choice of penny farthing. The farther away he got from home, the more amazed people were by his unusual bike. Jeff's worst experience was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which gave him a serious fever. He was bedridden in a hostel for ten days without medicine, and he didn't have enough money to pay for hospital bills or return home. Despite all this, Jeff would do it all again if he could afford it.

I work at a university in the US with a team to study water birds, particularly the American black duck. We've recently acquired a new piece of equipment called a night-vision scope, which allows us to observe the ducks at night. We're concerned about the decline in black duck numbers and want to know if there's enough food on the east coast for them. While we have a lot of information about their daytime behavior, we know very little about their nocturnal activities. This new equipment will enable us to gather more information and make informed decisions about conservation efforts. It's a challenging project, with four of us working six hours a day. We've studied ducks in various locations, and I've had to take a boat to some sites to make notes on every duck I see. The weather has been unpredictable, with both mild and wet nights. It's been quiet, so I've needed plenty of coffee to stay awake. We've only missed one working day due to heavy snow. Despite the challenges, I enjoy the project, especially compared to the summer, when we'll spend hours in a laboratory analyzing our results.

I work for a company that makes high-quality chocolate. People often can't believe what I do for a living, but it's true - I spend my days eating chocolate! As part of my job, I taste and evaluate samples of chocolate and the ingredients we use to make it. I check the taste, texture, and smell to ensure that our customers get the best possible chocolate. I also test new ingredients, like nuts and fruit, to see which ones work best in our chocolate. I have a private kitchen near my office where I can try out new recipes and share them with my colleagues. It's a great perk to have a space to experiment and share my creations with others.

My job is never routine. Some days I work in our laboratory, while others I travel to countries to source our raw materials. This can be challenging, especially since I have a young family.

Some people think backing singers aren't good enough to be lead singers, but that's not true. They have to be even better. Mariam is one of the real stars of the music industry.

""I love my job because I never know what I'll be asked to sing when I walk into the recording studio,"" Mariam says. ""It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock music. Sometimes it's a funny little tune for a radio station or an advertisement. Producers often surprise me with their requests. I was once asked to sing like a fish underwater! But I never argue, I just get on with the job.""

To be a good backing singer, you need excellent musical abilities and the ability to learn quickly. Sometimes, there's no written music to follow, so you have to remember everything. Mariam remembers her first time recording background music for a film. It was challenging because there were eight of them, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra as well. Mariam was nervous because if she made a mistake, they would have to record everything again, which is no fun. Recording sessions can be long enough already.

My father was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. As a kid, I used to watch many of his games. You might think that seeing so many matches would make me love the sport, but it actually had the opposite effect. I loved bragging to my friends about how good my dad was, especially when he won. But I would often bring a book to read instead of watching the game.

When I started secondary school, I was still a bit young, but already quite tall - 2 meters tall, to be exact. My sports teacher noticed my height and asked if I'd like to join the school basketball team. I was hesitant at first, but the teacher was very encouraging. It took me a few weeks to agree, but eventually, I started playing in matches against other schools. My parents coming to watch made me a bit nervous, but it was okay in the end.

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to the USA at the age of 15. I trained with a coach who worked with Olympic basketball players, which was amazing. However, I did find it hard to adjust to living away from my parents. At home, I never had much time for friends because of all the training, so it wasn't a big change for me. I got used to my new life in the end, and my English improved quickly too. I turned professional at 18, three years after moving to the USA. I was taller than most players in the league, but I was also quite light for my height, so I had to work on that.

Seven years ago, I was studying tourism in college, but I needed a part-time job to help pay for my studies. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my hometown, Chicago. I enjoyed showing visitors around the city and discovered that it was a new experience every time. After finishing my studies, I decided to become a full-time tour guide. However, I soon realized that getting a license required more knowledge than I had initially thought. To become a licensed guide, I had to learn about the city's history, architecture, and public transportation rules. After several months of hard work, I obtained my tour guide qualification and started working as an independent guide.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts or keeping track of the group. It also requires being entertaining, telling interesting stories, and being able to adapt to unexpected situations. For example, if a place is closed or a route changes, I need to come up with a plan B. Tourists want to have a stress-free and enjoyable experience, so I make sure to prioritize their satisfaction. If they're unhappy, they might leave a negative review online, which could harm my business. That's why I strive to make my tours fun and memorable.

I wasn't sure if we would fit in with the other volunteers, who were much older than us, but it turned out we had a great time. Our main job was to collect food for the elephants, which was a lot of work, but it was worth it to see them enjoy their meals. We also helped wash the elephants in the river, which was fun, even though I got wetter than they did! In the evenings, we would walk the elephants to their night-time enclosure in the forest. All the volunteers stayed in the same house, and Josie and I shared a room. The food was delicious, and it was nice not to have meat on the menu. After dinner, we would chat and play games with the other volunteers and staff. Now that we're back in the UK, Josie doesn't talk about Thailand much, but if someone asks if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I think she might be a bit annoyed with herself for not making the most of her time, but she can see how lucky she was to have gone. Maybe she'll go back one day - I definitely will!

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Simplified vocabulary and sentence structure to make it easier to understand
* Removed some of the more complex sentences and rephrased them in simpler terms
* Removed some of the more nuanced emotions and thoughts, such as Ella's speculation about Josie's feelings, to make the text more straightforward
* Kept the main events and facts of the story the same, but presented them in a more straightforward and easy-to-follow way.<|eot_id|>"

My name is Gina D'Costa, and I run a flower shop in the UK. We supply flowers to many different types of customers. Hotels, offices, and even businesses use our flowers for advertising photos. I once decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding, which was a big job but I was proud of how it turned out. My day starts early, at 4 a.m., when I go to the flower market to buy fresh flowers. It's not always easy, as it's usually cold and dark, but I don't let that bother me. The market is amazing, with flowers from all around the world. It's hard to make decisions because there are so many beautiful flowers and different smells. If I was choosing for myself, I would probably only choose pink flowers, which is my favorite color. But I have to remember that what I like and what my customers want might not be the same. It's not always easy to find the flowers that customers want, as not all flowers are available all the time. I'm not a big fan of arguing with the flower sellers about prices, but it's part of the job. Flowers can be expensive, so I have to try to get the best price I can. Back at the shop, we look at customer orders and arrange the flowers in vases. Then we create bouquets and calculate the cost of the orders. Sometimes customers are surprised by how much flowers cost, and I have to ask them to reconsider what they want. Some people might think this sounds like a lot of work, but I enjoy thinking about how I can create the most beautiful flowers for the price my customers are willing to pay. That's what I love about my job - I wouldn't want to do anything else.

My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films. I wanted to experience more than just watching a film, so I started a film club with two friends. We decided not to rent a cinema, but to choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we showed a film about Antarctica in an old factory, which added to the atmosphere. Some places we use are even free, as the owners make money from selling snacks during the film. We charge enough to cover our costs, but we're not trying to make a profit.

It's getting easier for us to organize each film night, especially since we have our own equipment now. We also know how many tickets we've sold because everything is online. This means we don't have to worry about empty seats. After each film, people of all ages come together to talk about what they thought of the movie. It's great to see how much they enjoy it.

Our website has been helpful, and we're now in touch with other film clubs across the country. We've visited other clubs to see how they do things, but it's always nice to come back to our own club. We've also started a blog because most people now look for information online. We've put up posters in cafes, but word of mouth is still the best way to get people to come. People love the special activities we do with each film, like our movie quiz last month, which everyone enjoyed.

As a child, I loved taking photographs. When I turned 15, I decided to take my hobby to the next level by starting a special project. I would take one photograph every day for a whole year. Many others had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea, so I started. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers to share my work and get feedback. I was surprised to find that others liked my style and enjoyed seeing my photos. I was taking pictures of all sorts of things, but then someone suggested that if I focused on a specific theme, my project would be even better. So, I started taking more photos of nature, especially birds and the sky. Most of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what others were doing. Sometimes I doubted my project, but I trusted my instincts and became more confident in my style. My art teacher at school told me about a national photography competition for young people, so I entered some of my photos. I was thrilled when I won first prize! It was the first time I realized that my photography was good enough to make a career out of it. Now, I have my own photography studio and I'm glad I chose this career path.<|eot_id|>"

I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because I wanted to try new things like camping and sailing, and learn skills like public speaking. The NYC offers different activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. You can start at a beginner level and work your way up to more advanced levels, with the help of adult leaders. When you complete each level, you get a certificate.

When I first joined, my leader suggested that I help organize activities at a local children's club for two hours a week. I was hesitant at first because I had a bad experience at that club when I was younger. But I decided to take the challenge because I wanted to earn my first certificate. To my surprise, I really enjoyed it and wanted to spend more time there. I even got to keep volunteering at the club after I finished the challenge because I had built good relationships with the children.

Now I volunteer for about four hours a week and I really look forward to it. Because of my experience at the children's club, I've decided that I want to go to college and become a youth worker when I finish school in three years. I never thought about this career path before, but the NYC has opened my eyes to new possibilities. I've also improved my communication skills while helping others, which is the best part.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

I was born in Denver, USA and started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I was too young to think about asking him, but he loved the sport and wanted me to love it too. He made it seem easy, and eventually, I got the hang of it. After that, I developed a passion for snowboarding and improved quickly. I started competing when I was ten years old.

Some people get bored with snowboarding, but my love for it has only grown stronger over time. I enjoy not having a fixed plan and sometimes it works out well, like when I became the first female to get a perfect score at a local competition. I wasn't sure I would attempt the jumps until I started doing them. That achievement boosted my confidence in my abilities.

During the summer, I focus on training and studying when there's no snow. While I train daily, I don't have to follow a strict diet like I do in the winter. I also get to spend time with my friends, which is nice. It's a good way to cope with not being able to snowboard as much as I want.

I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I also think it's important to have a backup plan. I'm considering becoming a doctor, but I'm not sure if I can balance that with my active lifestyle. It's hard to imagine not loving snowboarding, but I know I can't do it forever.

When I was 15, I wanted everything my friends had, and I didn't think about the future. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I thought I needed one too. My parents said I could get one if I paid for it myself, so I started working part-time to save up. I'm grateful to my parents for making me do this, as it taught me a valuable lesson.

I worked at a café on Saturdays, but I didn't enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own business instead. I had seen my mum making necklaces for herself, so I asked if I could try it too. I was surprised to find it wasn't as complicated as I thought. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited. My mum showed me how to create something attractive using simple tools and materials. I sold my first necklaces to my friends and family, and they liked them. However, I still wasn't convinced they were good enough for the public.

To test my products, I rented a market stall with my mum. We had a lot of tourists visiting, and they bought my necklaces to give to their family and friends. Soon, we started receiving orders from all over the country. People thought we were a big company with many employees, but we were just two people running a small market stall! That's when I knew it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Since then, I've made thousands of pounds through my business, mostly online, and we still have our market stall too. It's been a lot of fun so far.

Janine Stuart wrote a novel called Being Amelia when she was just 13 years old. The book became a bestseller. Being Amelia is partly based on Janine's own life. In an interview, Janine said that because her family moved around a lot when she was young, she learned how to make new friends easily. This experience helped her write about the main character, Amelia, who has to adapt to a new school. Janine also drew inspiration from her own home life, including her relationship with her older brother. Since she's an only child, she had to use her imagination to describe her brother's character.

Janine started writing Being Amelia during a summer holiday when she was feeling bored at home. Her parents had always encouraged her to write, and she had even won a short story competition the year before. When she finished the novel, she sent it to a publishing company, and they were very interested in it. A year later, the book was available in bookstores.

One reviewer praised the book, saying that despite the happy-looking cover, the characters in the story face some tough challenges, which makes them relatable. The reviewer also thought that Janine, who was still quite young at the time, was a talented writer, even better than some well-known authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous author, but she's learned to deal with it. She advises young writers to find their own way and not worry too much about it. For her, she just needs to spend time with her friends and she'll come up with new ideas to write about.

I'm Tom, 15 years old, and my family and I moved to a castle on a small island three years ago. My dad was offered the job of managing the castle, which is part of his work for an organization that takes care of historical buildings and opens them to the public. At first, we were hesitant about the move, especially because it meant leaving our cozy home and the school. We were worried about the castle being uncomfortable and there being no school on the island. However, we quickly adjusted to island life. The castle isn't particularly beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. During the summer, the island is lively with many visitors, and there are often parties on the beach. In the winter, we mostly see the other families who live on the island, and there aren't many teenagers. The adults are very supportive and help each other with repairs, which can be hard work. The biggest change for me was traveling to school every day by boat. I was excited to go on stormy days, but the ferries don't run then! I've also learned that if I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I miss the last ferry home, which is stressful. When my friends come to visit, I always remind them to hurry up! We often get amazing views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Some days, it's foggy, but then the sun comes out again, which is still amazing. We do get bad storms, and sometimes I worry about the castle's safety. But then I remember it's been here for centuries and is still standing.

I live in a beautiful countryside in Scotland. I've always loved nature and animals, so I started birdwatching six years ago. My family and I went to the mountains in northern Scotland and saw many birds in their natural habitat. I spent hours watching them with my parents, who taught me how to identify different species and find the best places to see them. It was amazing! After that, I joined a local birdwatching club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I've almost reached it. When we go on family holidays, we look for places where we can go birdwatching together. We've been to Egypt and South America, where I've seen many new birds. It's not always easy, though - sometimes you have to be patient. I shared a video about my challenge online, and many people enjoyed it. My teachers asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school, which was a bit nerve-wracking, but it went well.

I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I would rush home from school to play with other kids. I loved it, and as I got better, I became a pretty good player. My family thought I might lose interest like I did with other hobbies, but I didn't. In fact, I dreamed of playing professionally when I grew up. And it happened sooner than I expected.

I played in local tournaments, and a referee noticed I was talented. He asked the manager of a professional women's team to watch me play. She was impressed and asked me to join her team. I was surprised because I didn't know girls could play in women's teams. But she saw potential in me, and I started training with the team at 13. I improved a lot, but some people still doubted I could be a star player, which made me feel a bit down. However, my coach encouraged me to believe in myself and be myself. He even let me play in a championship match earlier than expected. I was nervous, but I played my best, and we won. I scored the winning goal, and the team carried me around the pitch. It was amazing!

Since then, I've scored many more winning goals. Next month, my coach and I are organizing a football tournament for teenagers. We want to get them interested in football and show them what it's like to play for a professional team. My advice to them will be the same as my coach gave me: you'll have good times, but be prepared for tough times too. I've been lucky, but I've also worked hard, and that's important.

In recent years, there has been a significant shift in the way students approach research in higher education. The idea is to involve students in research as early as possible in their studies. This is because research is not just for famous scholars or experts in a particular field. It's a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills will be useful not only in your studies but also in your future career. As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions and finding answers.

Research is about asking questions like ""Why?"", ""How?"", ""When?"", and ""What if?"" instead of just accepting what you're told. You need to think critically and question what you read or hear. This is because knowledge is not fixed and can be challenged.

In higher education, you're expected to think critically and construct your own knowledge. This can be daunting, but it's an important part of learning. You need to engage with what you read, think about it, and test it out. You should also question whether what you're being told is logical, reasonable, and backed by evidence.

You've probably already been doing some research without realizing it. For example, when you're planning a holiday or trying to fix something, you're using research skills. These skills will help you in your studies and future career.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Cities have long been a hub of intellectual activity. From 18th-century coffeehouses in London, where people gathered to discuss chemistry and politics, to modern-day cafes in Paris, where artist Pablo Picasso shared his thoughts on modern art. However, city life is not always easy. The same cafes that sparked discussions also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually left the city for the countryside. The modern city is a place of creativity, but it's also overwhelming and unnatural.

Scientists have started to study how cities affect our brains, and the results are surprising. While it's well-known that city life can be exhausting, research suggests that cities actually make us less intelligent. One of the main reasons is the lack of nature. Studies have shown that patients in hospitals recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief glimpses of nature improve brain performance because they give our minds a break from the urban grind.

This research comes at a time when most people live in cities. Instead of living in wide-open spaces, we're crowded into concrete jungles with millions of strangers. In recent years, it's become clear that our unnatural surroundings have important effects on our mental and physical health. They can even change how we think.

Imagine walking down a busy street: you need to pay attention to pedestrians, traffic, and the confusing urban layout. This constant mental effort leaves us feeling drained. Cities are so full of stimuli that our brains need to constantly redirect our attention. This process requires energy and effort, like a powerful computer processing information. Natural settings, on the other hand, don't require as much mental effort.

This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He hypothesized that being in nature could have a restorative effect on our minds. Natural settings capture our attention, but they don't trigger negative emotions like a police siren. Our mental machinery can relax and replenish itself.

Philosophers and landscape architects have long warned about the effects of city life and sought ways to integrate nature into modern life. Urban parks like Central Park in New York allow people to escape the city. A well-designed park can improve brain function within minutes. While people have searched for ways to improve cognitive performance, it seems that simply taking a walk in nature is one of the most effective methods.

Given the mental problems caused by city life, the question remains: Why do cities continue to grow? And why do they remain hubs of intellectual life? Research shows that the same urban features that trigger lapses in attention and memory – crowded streets and close proximity to others – also contribute to innovation. The concentration of social interactions is responsible for urban creativity. Just as crowded London led to intellectual breakthroughs in the past, crowded Cambridge, Massachusetts, contributes to its success as a creative center today. The key is to find ways to mitigate the psychological damage of the city while maintaining its unique benefits.<|eot_id|>"

Where should we look for the mind? It's a question that may seem strange: isn't thinking inside our heads? We use advanced techniques to study the brain, but I think it's wrong to stop there. There's a lot of evidence from the past to the present that shows objects and things are part of our thinking and learning. From an archaeological perspective, it's clear that objects like stones, jewelry, and written symbols played a crucial role in human evolution and the development of the human mind. This means that what's outside our heads may not be outside our minds.

It's easy to understand why people think the mind is just the brain. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people in isolation, away from the objects they normally use. This makes sense for scientists who use brain-scanning machines, but it overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads.

I'm not questioning the importance of the brain, but I'm suggesting that the mind is more than just the brain. Instead, I propose that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into the world around us. This is the idea behind my Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET explores how objects become part of our thinking and learning, like when we make numbers and symbols out of clay or use a stone to create a tool. It also looks at how this has changed over time and what it means for how we think.

Think of a blind person using a stick. Where does their self begin? The stick is an extension of their body, and they use it to feel their environment. This shows that our minds are capable of reorganizing themselves in response to new tools and technology. My approach sees the human mind as an ongoing project, constantly evolving.

It's essential to remember that, whether it's a stone tool or the internet, our primary goal is to use these tools to understand and navigate the world. This unique human ability to engage with material culture explains why we make things and how those things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds are capable of changing and developing as they interact with the world. MET offers a new way to understand how different objects, from ancient tools to modern technology, have helped shape our minds and our understanding of ourselves.

The idea of mind-changing technology may sound futuristic, but humans have been using it since the earliest days of our species.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 learner:

Photography has had a huge impact on our understanding of the world and how we live our lives. In the United States, photography became an integral part of American culture, influencing many aspects of society, from science and industry to art and entertainment. Historians consider photography to be the country's most significant contribution to the visual arts. This is a big claim, but it reflects the significant role photography has played in shaping American intellectual and aesthetic discourse.

So, why was photography so appealing? Firstly, it was a mechanical process that matched the growing enthusiasm for technology in the United States. Just as new technologies like steam power, railroads, and electricity made the world smaller and more connected, photography brought the world into people's homes in a way that was previously unimaginable. Secondly, the camera was seen as a tool for representing oneself, allowing people to present an image of themselves to the public in a country where individual and national identities were constantly evolving. Thirdly, the camera became an important means of creating and preserving family memories, allowing people to record their lives and share them with others.

Photographs are unique in that they are a way of drawing attention to something, saying ""Look at this!"" and presenting a particular view of the world. They can be both objective, recording what was in front of the camera, and subjective, reflecting the photographer's perspective. The meaning of a photograph is not always clear-cut, as it depends on the context in which it is viewed and the information surrounding it.

In recent decades, artists have incorporated photography into their work, using it as a medium in its own right or combining it with other art forms. Photography has become an essential part of the artistic process, and its influence can be seen in many different areas of art and culture.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

William James, an American philosopher and psychologist, defined psychology as the'science of mental life' in 1890. This definition remains relevant today. We all have a mental life, and our understanding of it is personal and private. It's based on our thoughts, feelings, and experiences. We can make judgments about psychological matters using our own experiences, but this can be limited. For example, we might think we know why someone behaves in a certain way, but our understanding might be biased.

Psychologists try to provide methods for deciding which explanations are most likely to be correct. They distinguish between subjective thoughts and facts. They study the brain, but it's difficult to understand how it works. Instead, they study behavior and use observations to make hypotheses about what's going on inside us.

The study of psychology is challenging because the workings of the mind are not directly observable. Psychologists have to infer what's going on by observing behavior. It's like solving a crossword puzzle, where you have to evaluate and interpret clues.

Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes it studies. It has practical applications in areas like education, machine design, and helping people with emotional distress. While psychologists have been exploring psychological questions for centuries, the scientific study of psychology is a relatively recent development.

Early psychologists relied on introspection, or reflecting on their own experiences, to understand the mind. However, this method has limitations. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on observations of others' behavior rather than their own experiences.

Here is a simplified version of the passage, suitable for a C1 learner:

In a warehouse in Michigan, USA, there's a unique museum that showcases failed products. It's a collection of items that were never popular and were eventually withdrawn from the market. The museum's owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has a story to tell about the designers, marketers, and salespeople who created it. What's surprising is that this museum exists as a profitable business. Most companies would have their own collection of failed products, but they don't. The museum's owner, Robert McMath, started collecting products in the 1960s, thinking he would create a reference library. However, he ended up with a collection of mostly unsuccessful products.

This might be because of the culture of optimism in business. Companies often invest more money in a failing product to try to make it work, rather than admitting defeat. This means that they don't learn from their mistakes and often repeat the same errors. The self-help industry also promotes a culture of positivity, encouraging people to focus on the good things that might happen rather than the bad. However, research has shown that this approach can actually be counterproductive. When people spend too much time thinking about how well things could go, they can become less motivated to achieve their goals.

Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen has found that people who spend too much time thinking about their goals can actually achieve less than those who don't. This is because people's experiences of failure are influenced by their beliefs about ability. Some people believe that ability is fixed and that failure means they're not good enough, while others believe that ability can be developed through hard work and challenge. The latter approach can lead to a happier and more fulfilling life, even if it doesn't always result in success.

Here is the simplified text:

Sports teams often perform better when they play at home, but why is this the case? Some people think it's obvious, but experts are now questioning this idea. Two main factors have changed the way we think about home advantage: science and money. Scientists are trying to understand what makes players perform at their best, and they've come up with many theories about the impact of home advantage. Meanwhile, team owners want to know why home advantage matters at all, especially if players are well-paid and comfortable playing away.

Fans might think that their team's passion and commitment are what give them an edge at home, but this might just be a coincidence. In reality, home fans often direct their energy towards the referee, trying to influence their decisions. Research has shown that referees are more likely to make decisions in favor of the home team when they hear the crowd noise, even if it's just a recording.

Despite changes in sports over the years, such as better travel conditions and more comfortable playing environments, home advantage is still a significant factor. In fact, studies have shown that home advantage has actually decreased in some sports, but not as much as you might expect. One reason for this might be that players are more comfortable playing away from home, thanks to better travel and accommodations.

However, home advantage varies greatly between sports. For example, basketball and football teams tend to do better at home, while baseball teams don't seem to have as much of an advantage. This could be because basketball and football are team sports, where players need to work together to win, while baseball is more individual-focused.

There's also a more primal explanation for home advantage: players' testosterone levels increase before home matches, making them more aggressive and motivated to defend their territory. This sense of territoriality might be linked to a deep-seated instinct to protect one's home turf, as seen in the Rugby World Cup.

Overall, the mystery of home advantage remains, and researchers continue to explore the many factors that contribute to this phenomenon.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Gary Player, a famous golfer, once said, ""The more I practice, the luckier I get."" This phrase has been widely used by athletes and coaches around the world. However, its meaning is not straightforward. Player was being ironic, and his real message was that ""The more I practice, the better I get."" But where does this idea stop? Does it mean that anyone can become an expert with enough practice, or is there a limit?

This question is at the heart of the nature-nurture debate in sports. The debate is not balanced; instead, it seems to be dominated by the idea that practice is more important than innate talent. This idea is based on the work of psychologist Anders Ericsson, who suggested that expertise can be achieved with 10,000 hours of practice. Many books have been written on this topic, concluding that practice is what matters most.

However, some experts argue that this is not the whole story. They suggest that there are other factors that contribute to someone's success, such as their environment, support, and opportunities. To explore this idea, the author of this book, Epstein, traveled around the world, studying different cases. He found that some people's abilities may be influenced by their genes, and that drive and determination may not be entirely voluntary.

Epstein also examines the importance of training and environment, and suggests that both are crucial for elite athletes. He also looks at cases where genes play a significant role, and discusses the issue of race and gender in sports. For example, he asks why we separate men and women in athletic competitions if practice is the only factor that matters.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

A recent report reveals that many children in wealthy countries feel unhappy and lonely. Jay Griffiths, the author of a new book called Kith, believes that this is because they are spending too much time indoors, staring at screens, and not enough time in nature. She argues that this is the main problem. This idea is supported by other discussions about childhood.

A follow-up study asked children about their unhappiness and found that many of them said they would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Many adults also remember their own childhoods fondly, recalling long summer days playing in the woods, swimming in ponds, or building dens. However, they rarely consider that they are the ones who have created the protected environment for their own children, keeping them indoors for fear of danger.

Griffiths' book is full of strong arguments. She is excellent on the connection between the fear of danger and consumerism. Parents' fear of danger makes them want to keep their children at home, which benefits the toy and gadget industry. She also writes about the trend of prescribing medication for restless children or insisting that kids wear goggles for playground games. While some of these regulations may be widespread, others may be exaggerated or even urban myths.

Griffiths' arguments are engaging and inspirational, but she sometimes goes too far. She ignores counterarguments and makes sweeping statements, such as comparing the treatment of children to racism. Griffiths is a romantic who idealizes children and believes they should be free to roam and take risks. She thinks children need to experience some danger to learn how to manage it. However, she doesn't explain how to achieve this or consider that not all children want to take risks. What about those who are naturally timid or cautious? Maybe the real problem is forcing all children into the same mold, whether by keeping them indoors or pushing them out.

As a researcher in bio-psychology, I've learned that most problems in life can't be solved with formulas or memorized answers. Instead, they require judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences are embedded in play. My recent research focuses on the importance of play for children's development.

All mammals, including humans, play when they're young. Those that have the most to learn play the most. Children, who have the most to learn, play the most when allowed to do so. Play is a natural way for humans and animals to educate themselves.

The most important skills children need to learn are those that can't be taught in school. These skills, such as creativity, cooperation, and self-control, are learned and practiced through play. Creativity is essential for success, as we need people who can think innovatively and solve new problems.

Adults who are creative are often those who retain their childlike curiosity and imagination. Albert Einstein, for example, credited his ability to think creatively to his childhood play. We can't teach creativity, but we can stifle it by focusing on a rigid curriculum that doesn't allow for children's own questions and curiosity.

It's also crucial for children to learn social skills, such as getting along with others and cooperating, through play. Children are naturally inclined to play with others and learn important values like fairness and morality.

However, today's schools often prioritize academics over play, with longer school days, more homework, and increased pressure for high grades. This has led to a decline in unsupervised play and a rise in adult-directed activities. To ensure our children grow into strong, well-rounded adults, we must give them more opportunities to play and explore, and allow them to follow their natural instincts.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 learner:

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to find a job. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers, which was previously only possible by standing outside an office with a ""Hire me"" sign. However, with greater access comes a greater risk of making mistakes. A recent incident on LinkedIn highlights the importance of being careful when using social media professionally.

A young jobseeker in the US contacted a senior marketing executive, hoping to get help finding a job. The executive had a large network of influential people, which the jobseeker thought could be useful. However, the executive was not impressed and sent a harsh rejection message that went viral. While the tone of the message was unacceptable, it also served as a warning to young people about the dangers of using social media in a professional context.

Many young people have been using social media since they were teenagers, when it was a way to escape from parents and teachers and to present a different image of themselves. However, using social media for professional purposes is a different story. Young people need to understand that their online behavior can have consequences and that they must adapt to a more professional tone.

One common mistake that young jobseekers make is being too familiar or arrogant in their messages. This can give the impression that they are entitled to a job, which is not the case. In reality, many young people are struggling to find employment and are desperate to make a good impression.

To make a good impression on professional networking sites, it is important to be clear about who you are and what you can offer. Avoid sending generic emails and keep your tone humble. Remember that social media can be a powerful tool for making connections, but it requires careful handling to be effective.

Newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national dailies has fallen by a third to half. In the US, the Pew Research Centre reports that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26% of citizens, compared to 45% in 2001. Many experts predict that the last printed newspaper will be gone within 15 years. However, old media have a habit of surviving. For example, theatre survived the rise of newspapers, radio, and television. Even vinyl records, which were thought to be dead, have seen a significant increase in sales.

Newspapers were once new media, but it took time for them to become the dominant source of news. This was due to advances in technology, such as the steam press, the railway, and the telegraph, which made it possible to produce and distribute news quickly and efficiently. Additionally, people began to expect change and wanted to stay informed about what was happening in the world.

In the past, people didn't need news on a regular basis, and journalism as a profession didn't exist until the 19th century. Even then, there was no obvious reason why people needed news daily or weekly. However, the regular publication of newspapers and their rigid format can be a burden. Online news allows readers to access information at any time and personalize their news based on their interests.

Despite these advantages, online news providers often prioritize being the first to break the news and generating comments, rather than focusing on spreading understanding and enlightenment. This can lead to a sense of confusion and chaos. In the past, news was often shared in public places, where truth was mixed with rumors and misunderstandings. Today, we seem to be returning to a similar situation.

Newspapers have never been very good at explaining how the world works, and perhaps they will eventually disappear. Alternatively, they may discover that they are the only ones who can guide us towards wisdom and understanding in a chaotic world.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the passage, adapted for a C1 level learner:

If humans were meant to live in the dark, we would feel at home under the light of the moon and stars, just like many nocturnal animals. However, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in sunlight. This is deeply ingrained in our genetic makeup. As a result, we have managed to engineer the night to suit our needs by filling it with artificial light. This control comes with consequences, known as light pollution, which scientists are only now studying. Light pollution is mainly caused by poorly designed lighting that shines upwards and outwards, rather than downwards, where it's needed. This artificial light washes out the natural darkness, disrupting the natural rhythms of many living things, including ourselves. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it affects many aspects of life, such as migration, reproduction, and feeding. For most of human history, the concept of light pollution would have been meaningless. Imagine walking through London on a moonlit night in the early 19th century, when it was the world's most populous city. Few houses were lit by gas, and there were no public gaslights in the streets or squares. From a distance, you would have been more likely to smell London than see its faint glow. We have lit up the night as if it were an empty space, when in fact it's home to many nocturnal creatures. Many mammals, including birds, are attracted to light, and artificial light can have a powerful effect on their behavior. For example, some birds are drawn to searchlights and gas flares, circling around them until they drop. Migrating birds are also prone to colliding with brightly lit buildings. Some birds even sing at unnatural hours when they're near artificial light. It was once thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, who need to study the night sky in all its clarity. However, like all creatures, we need darkness to maintain our biological rhythms and overall health. Denying ourselves darkness is futile, as it's essential for our well-being. The regular rhythm of day and night is fundamental to our being, and disrupting it can cause physical ailments. In the end, humans are no less trapped by light pollution than animals near a brightly lit highway. By living in a world of artificial light, we have cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage – the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a sense, light pollution makes us lose sight of our true place in the universe, forgetting the scale of our existence, which is best measured against the vastness of a dark night with the Milky Way shining above.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

The founder of a large company has announced that it will no longer track employees' paid holiday time. This decision was inspired by a similar policy at an internet company. The founder claims that the idea came from an email from his daughter, but some people think it might have been a marketing stunt.

The policy allows employees to take as much time off as they want, as long as they are sure it won't harm the business. However, this approach might not work well for a large company with many employees and different departments. It's hard to know if an employee's absence would really affect the business, and it's also difficult to ensure that all tasks are completed before taking a break.

In reality, it's impossible to be 100% sure that everything is under control before going on holiday. There will always be work to catch up on when you return. This could lead to feelings of guilt and stress, which could negatively impact productivity.

The policy could also create pressure among colleagues and lead to a culture where people feel they need to work long hours to stay ahead. Without a clear limit on holiday time, people might feel hesitant to take time off, fearing it will be seen as lazy.

Technology has blurred the line between work and leisure time, making it difficult to disconnect from work. The internet company's policy was introduced in response to employees' concerns about balancing work and personal life. However, this doesn't mean that the policy is necessarily a good idea.

Employment laws exist for a reason, and workers are entitled to a certain amount of paid annual leave to maintain their mental and physical well-being. Increased morale, creativity, and productivity can be achieved through other means, but it's unclear if unlimited holiday time is the best way to achieve these benefits.

I remain skeptical about the effectiveness of this policy and whether it will truly benefit employees in the long run.<|eot_id|>"

Scientific research papers are reviewed by other experts in the same field to ensure their quality. This process is considered essential to prevent the publication of flawed or nonsensical papers. However, some scientists argue that this system has its limitations. The review process can take up to a year, which may not be worth the delay. Additionally, the growing use of preprints, which are drafts of papers posted online without peer review, is changing the way research is published.

Preprints allow academics to share their findings quickly, enabling others to read, critique, and build upon their work. This is in contrast to traditional journals, which prioritize fame and career advancement over the dissemination of new results. The excessive rewards for publishing in top journals can lead to corner-cutting and the omission of inconvenient data.

The job of reviewers has also become distorted, as they often focus on whether a manuscript is suitable for a particular journal rather than its scientific quality. Top journals may prioritize topicality or newsworthiness over scientific quality. This has led to a crisis in science, where few are willing to challenge the current system.

However, some scientists argue that preprints could be a solution. They don't require a significant change from the current system, and they allow for immediate feedback and discussion from a global community of reviewers. Preprints also enable the publication of negative results, which are an essential part of the scientific process.

By embracing the web's culture of openness and accessibility, preprints can refocus attention on the quality of the research rather than its publication. They can help to increase the dissemination of research and promote a collaborative ethos within the scientific community.<|eot_id|>"

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it's like a painting with words. But I'm not satisfied with their answers. So, I asked them to write two paragraphs about an object - one from a scientific perspective, and another from the object's point of view. One student chose an oxygen mask and wrote: ""I may look strange or scary, but I help people breathe in emergencies. Most people won't need me, but I'm always ready to help."" This exercise helped us understand how poetry is unique.

I didn't appreciate poetry when I was in school. I saw it as a puzzle that got in the way of understanding and feeling. After school, poetry becomes less important for most people. Sometimes, a poem stands out because it's different from regular writing. It's like a challenge to read it, and often we feel disappointed or confused. But we still try to understand it. What do we hope to find in a poem? We want it to be deep, moving, and thought-provoking. But we can find those things in other forms of art, like films, novels, or music. Poetry has one special quality: ambiguity. Our daily lives are full of ambiguity, and poetry reflects that.

We can look up the definition of a poem in an encyclopedia, but it's not very helpful. It says poetry is a form of art that uses language in a special way. But the word ""poem"" comes from the Greek word ""poí?ma"", which means ""thing made"". So, what kind of thing is a poem? Some poets compare poems to wild animals or machines, but these comparisons don't work. The important thing is not the comparison, but the debate it sparks. This debate can change our thinking and help us see things in a new way.

A poem is like a mental object that can get stuck in our heads, like a song. The combination of words and music has a powerful effect. A poem on a page can be powerful, even though it's just words on paper. The empty space around the poem is important, too. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting, but it's not meant to be a commodity. It's a unique thing that presents itself for its own sake, not for the market. This is why a poem can still surprise us, even in a world filled with other forms of art.<|eot_id|>"

I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It was a big investment, but my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every treasure I've discovered has given me a sense of connection to the past. But it took 40 years for me to find something that impressed Marion again. One rainy afternoon, I decided to search a spot near an old farm. My detector beeped, and I dug up a piece of a metal wheel. Then, it beeped again. I couldn't ignore it, so I dug deeper and found a golden ball. As I brushed away the dirt, it became clear that it was a beautiful, intricately patterned loop. I had seen something similar before - the Great Torc, a famous necklace from ancient Britain. It's over 2,000 years old and made of gold and silver. I took it to the car and couldn't stop staring at it. When I got home, I showed it to Marion and explained what it was. We were both careful not to touch it because it was so valuable. Eventually, I reported it to the authorities and sold it to my local council. The £350,000 we got from the sale was split between the owner of the field and me. But the Torc has been more than just a lucky find - it's something I've preserved for the nation. People tell me that now that I've found something so valuable, I should stop searching. But I love the thrill of the hunt, and I'll keep searching for more treasures.<|eot_id|>"

Sleep is one of my favorite things to do when I travel, but I don't often talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When friends share their detailed travel plans, I just smile and don't say much. Their plans usually involve a lot of activities, like visiting museums and hiking. But my own travel plans often include plenty of time for naps in the afternoon or sleeping in late in the morning. I think this is one of the best things about traveling.

When I visited Mexico's Yucatán coast when I was in my early twenties, I was surprised to find that I slept for more than 12 hours a day. The noise from the birds outside didn't bother me, and I felt more relaxed than I ever do at home. I think this is because I was far away from my usual routine and surroundings, and my brain was processing all the new sights, sounds, and smells.

I believe that sleep is an important part of traveling, not just a way to rest. When we travel, we experience new things and take in new information, and our brains process all of this while we sleep. This is why sleep can be so much better when we're on the road. It's like our brains are working overtime to make sense of everything we've seen and experienced.

Sleep patterns can also change depending on where we are. For example, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early in the morning to avoid the heat, and then take a nap in the middle of the day. It took me a few days to get used to this rhythm, but once I did, I felt like I was really part of the local culture.

I remember one afternoon in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with some new friends and then took a nap on a hammock. It was the first time I'd experienced the traditional Latin American siesta, and it felt wonderful. I realized that sleep can be a way to connect with the local culture and experience new things.

Travel sleep has another great benefit: it's often the thing I remember most about a trip. When I'm sleeping in a new place, I notice all the new sights, sounds, and smells that fill my brain. If I'm committed to ""slow travel"" and taking my time to enjoy each experience, then what's slower than sleep? Maybe I should stop feeling guilty about my love of sleep and share it with my friends.'<|eot_id|>"

""I still think this one suits you best,"" she said politely. The woman wrinkled her nose and scrunched up her face, looking like a bulldog. ""But it's too common,"" she said. ""Every other woman will be wearing a hat like that at my daughter's wedding. This little hat will make me stand out."" She patted the red and black miniature top hat on her head. ""Yes, this is the one I want,"" she decided. Mia knew when she was beaten and agreed that the woman would certainly stand out at the wedding.

Mia thought about her own daughter, Jen, who was turning 30 today. They were having a family gathering and Mia was looking forward to seeing her son-in-law, Dan, and her other son, Luke. She was also excited to meet the friend Jen was bringing, a woman named Tatiana, or Tattie for short. Mia's husband, Jeff, wasn't a fan of Tattie's name, thinking it was too pretentious. He didn't like Mia's habit of being too polite and always trying to avoid conflict. He would have told the woman in the shop that she was choosing the wrong hat and that a dustbin lid would suit her better.

After work, Mia closed the shop and walked into her home, Medlar House. She had converted the old barn into a light and airy space where she could run her own business, selling hats and other accessories. Jeff had been skeptical at first, but Mia was convinced that there was a demand for unique hats. She was right, and her business, Mia's Hats, was a success. Women came from all around to try on hats in her showroom in the village of Little Pelham. Mia offered changing rooms and encouraged customers to bring their outfits to try on with different hats. She had recently added handbags and costume jewelry to her collection.

From competing in the Olympic discus final to possibly joining an American football team, Lawrence has come a long way. Despite never having played American football before, he is likely to be selected for one of the major teams. In Atlanta, Lawrence is still figuring out his new position. The idea of a 21-year-old novice from London joining a top American football team seems incredible, but Lawrence is used to achieving the impossible.

Lawrence was initially offered a place at Oxford University to study law, but he decided to focus on training for the discus instead. Within 20 months, he became the world's fourth-best discus thrower. He came to Atlanta for warm-weather training and to prepare for the world championships. When he arrived, he decided to try out for American football, despite having never played before.

Lawrence had always thought about playing American football, but it wasn't until he arrived in the US that he decided to give it a try. He saw an advertisement for the NFL trials in Atlanta and applied online. He wasn't nervous about competing against experienced players, saying he doesn't get nervous easily. He performed well in the tests and drills, and was selected for the trials.

Lawrence is cautious about his chances of making it into an NFL team, given his lack of experience. However, he believes that his natural abilities and hard work will help him succeed. He is not worried about the pressure of possibly being selected, saying he is not under any pressure. He has already qualified for the Olympic discus final, where he did not perform as well as he had hoped. However, he is proud of his achievement and has moved on.

Lawrence's decision to switch from rugby to athletics and now American football may seem unusual, but he believes it is a calculated risk. If he doesn't make it in American football, he can always return to the discus, the sport he loves.<|eot_id|>"

My neighbor, Sergei, a salesman from Moscow, woke up and smiled at me. He was on his way to sell safety clothing to mining companies in a remote area. His English was limited, but we managed to communicate with the help of a dictionary. I told him I was flying to the city of Magadan in eastern Siberia, but I only had a one-way ticket. I planned to return to England by bicycle. Sergei was surprised and asked if I was going alone. I said yes, but I would be with a friend, Al.

In the Red Bull Air Race, 12 pilots compete by flying their planes through a series of tall pylons, performing sharp turns, rolls, and loops at speeds of up to 370 km/h. I was given the chance to experience it firsthand. Before the flight, I had to sign two forms: one confirming my good health and the other promising to empty my pockets, as small objects can become dangerous during the flight. I also learned that I needed to stay oriented and focused throughout the flight. The pilot told me to keep an eye on the horizon and relax when flying upside down.

During the safety briefing, I was warned not to touch anything in the plane. As we prepared for takeoff, I felt nervous and tense, trying not to touch the controls or pedals. The pilot, Dario, and I got into the Zivko Edge 540, one of the world's fastest acrobatic planes. We took off and accelerated down the runway, then banked sharply to the right. I felt the air rush out of my lungs and looked up at the horizon, trying to relax. We performed a series of sharp turns and dives, and I felt my stomach drop and my lungs squeeze up. We flew through a narrow space between two pylons at 400 km/h, and I felt a rush of excitement.

For two minutes, I got to control the plane, feeling its responsiveness and shaking with excitement. Then Dario asked me if I was okay, and instead of answering, he did a barrel roll. I was a bit overwhelmed, but I lied and said I was fine. He then did a loop, flying the plane upside down, and I felt my heart racing. As we landed, I was relieved it was over, but Dario seemed to enjoy it. He even ate sandwiches while we were still on the ground.

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films animals in cold places. He's worked on many documentaries and has been to places like Antarctica and the Arctic. He loves the thrill of filming in extreme conditions and has developed a feel for it over the years.

Allan used to work as a marine biologist and commercial diver, which helped him learn about survival in cold places. He got his big break when a TV crew asked him to help them film a wildlife documentary in Antarctica. He enjoyed it so much that he decided to become a wildlife cameraman.

When Allan started his career, filming technology was basic, and he had to remember every shot he took. Now, with digital technology, he can shoot more footage and review it immediately. This makes it easier to plan and capture the best shots.

Allan's expertise lies in his experience filming in cold conditions. He's spent a lot of time on sea ice and knows how to adapt to the harsh environment. He's had some amazing experiences, but also some failures and embarrassments. For example, he once got stuck filming kittiwakes in the Orkneys and couldn't identify the birds.

Recently, Allan filmed polar bears in the Arctic Ocean. It was a challenging assignment, with temperatures as low as -32°C and strong winds. He spent 23 days waiting for a glimpse of the bears, but finally, on the 24th day, he saw a mother bear and her cub. He was thrilled to capture the moment on camera.

Now, Allan wants to make a documentary about climate change in the Arctic, focusing on the people who live there and the impact of climate change on their daily lives. He believes he can make an extraordinary film that will raise awareness about this important issue.

His nanny, who used to work for a famous polar explorer, would send him out into the Scottish mountains in harsh weather conditions to toughen him up. Pen's father, who loved adventure, passed on this passion to him. Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman who shares his love for the outdoors. She helps him with his polar guide business and is worried about him when he's away.

This time, Pen will be away from his family for three months, which is harder for him. He's planning to limit his contact with them while he's away because he doesn't want to remind them of his distance. Pen will be accompanied by two experienced colleagues, Ann Daniels and Martin Hartley, and a team of six people who will provide support. Pen is nervous about the expedition because he hasn't trained as much as he would like, and he's worried about asking too much of himself.

Pen believes that this expedition is important because it will help scientists understand the impact of global warming on the Arctic region. He thinks that explorers like him, who were once seen as unusual, are now needed more than ever to help with this critical research.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, rewritten for a C1 learner:

I took a year off after being an Olympic athlete. I had the opportunity to do more writing and TV work, and speak to businesses and schools. Although I enjoyed the variety, I missed the challenge of competing. To stay in shape, I started participating in marathons and triathlons. Meanwhile, TV presenter Ben Fogle kept asking me to join him on a rowing trip across the Atlantic. I loved the feeling of rowing, but I wasn't ready to commit to intense training seven days a week. I talked to some rowing friends about joining the race, but they weren't interested. I knew that if I participated, I would want to win, but with Ben, our chances of winning would be slim. On the other hand, I thought it could be exciting to be the underdog with no pressure. I contacted Ben, and we discussed the costs of the race, which would be around £70,000. We realized we had a good chance of winning, but it would require a lot of effort. I also had to consider the loss of income from not being able to work as a speaker at business conferences. As a retired athlete, speaking at conferences is one of the most profitable ways for me to earn money. I found it hard to talk about my past achievements without having a new goal. Participating in the race would allow me to do something new and exciting, and I could bring that experience to my speaking engagements. During the preparation, I learned to appreciate the ease of being a full-time athlete. My Olympic training was tough, but it was structured, with doctors and dieticians to support me. In hindsight, it was relatively straightforward. I had concerns about people's reactions to me racing with a TV presenter, but they disappeared as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is as much about mental toughness as physical endurance. Ben had completed challenging events like the Marathon des Sables and spent time at sea, but he couldn't row. I was surprised by how little experience he had with boats, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I should have realized that would be his level when I agreed to race with him.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

About a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. I was 26 and feeling restless, dreaming of the Arctic landscape and the quiet, vast expanses of snow and ice. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband Pasi Ikonen in Finnish Lapland. They agreed to take me on as a husky dog handler for the winter season. From December to February, they take tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow. The company started with six dogs and grew to over 100. They recently bought a second property, a ""wilderness farm"", which is a basic outpost with limited electricity and no running water. I joined the team for three months, but I was warned that the work would be physically demanding and the conditions tough.

On my flight to Finland, I stared blankly at a page with over 100 husky names, but I was distracted and anxious. I put the page down and looked out the window instead. As we flew over the landscape, I saw the opposite of spring - winter marching south, with rivers freezing over.

When I arrived at the farm, I was handed a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. Anna asked if I wanted to be thrown in at the deep end, but it was clear I was already there. I followed the sound of barking to the dogsheds, where I saw three people running back and forth, harnessing the huskies to sleds. The dogs were excited and straining against the ropes. I barely heard Anna's greeting, but she gestured impatiently for me to join the group. We set off into the dark, with only a head torch for light.

It didn't take long to learn the basics of dog-sledding, but I struggled with other tasks, like feeding and watering the dogs in sub-zero conditions. A bowl of water would freeze solid while I watched, so we had to make a warm soup for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head was spinning with instructions and my muscles ached from dragging heavy sleds and being pulled around by enthusiastic huskies. But I was proud of myself - I had learned to chop wood, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw in the snow.

On the day she finished the marathon, the press gathered to understand her incredible achievement. They noted that her time was good enough to qualify her for the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists were curious about a natural treatment she used, emu oil, which was recommended by Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman to help heal the wounds from a freak accident during training. Radcliffe said that she didn't really realize the significance of her achievement at the time. She and her support team had set a motto: ""no limits."" During the race, her coach and physiotherapist were worried about her pace, but she managed to finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes. She had run 41 kilometres at a fast pace and then sprinted the last 800 metres in 2 minutes 25 seconds. At the finish, she thought she could run even faster.

Radcliffe's coach, Gerard Hartmann, worked with her for weeks at a time, providing daily sessions to help her recover from her intense training. He said that she was an exceptional athlete who could handle a lot of pain. After the race, everyone was surprised that she had beaten the East African runners, who were known for their skill and grace. Hartmann said that Radcliffe would push him to his limits, extracting every last bit of effort from him.

Radcliffe believes that her hard work and mental toughness were key to her success. She also thinks that many people were inspired by her achievement and started running long-distance themselves.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 learner:

When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was first broadcast, I was worried about how it would be received. I had created a series that combined cooking techniques with history, nostalgia, and science, but I wasn't sure if people would appreciate it. I was relieved to see that the show was a success and paved the way for other projects, including a book based on my experiences at my own restaurant. 

In each project, I feel like I'm on a journey, whether it's exploring the past, exploring people's minds, or mastering cooking techniques. I wrote a series of books called 'Perfection', each one accompanying a TV show of the same name. These books took me on a physical journey, traveling to different places and meeting fascinating people along the way. In my latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, I travel the world to meet artisans who have dedicated their lives to achieving perfection in their craft. 

Perfection is subjective, and even choosing which dishes to include in the book was a challenge. I knew I would upset some people by leaving out their favorite dishes. However, after discussing it with my team, we came up with a list that had something for everyone. This reinforced my belief that each of us has our own idea of perfection, shaped by our personal experiences and emotions.

I didn't claim that the recipes in the book were definitive, but I used my technical skills and scientific knowledge to understand what makes each dish work. The TV series gave me the opportunity to explore new foods, people, and places, and I was excited to share my discoveries with others. My adventures took me to canning factories, dairy farms, and even a hospital scanning machine! I even had to hand-milk a cow and use dry ice to make ice cream, and I almost set my house on fire trying to cook a Neapolitan-style pizza.

We were still a few hours away from Marrakech when our van broke down in a field. John got out to take a look at the engine. He stood there for a long time, looking worried. 'I have no idea what I'm doing,' he said, and he and my mum started laughing. My sister Bea was worried, 'We can't stay here forever,' she said. The field was huge, with nothing much in it except grass and flowers.

We got back in the van and waited for John to find someone who knew how to fix the car. My mum lay down on the grass and told us to tell her a story. I told them about two birds I had heard talking the day before we left London. I told them all the things the birds had talked about, including an argument they had over a worm. My sister laughed, 'That's silly, no one understands bird language,' she said. I felt embarrassed.

When John came back with some Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to a nearby hotel, my sister refused to get out. The boys didn't mind and waved and smiled at her through the back window. We went into the hotel café, which was set back from the road. My mum ordered some tea, which was made from mint leaves and was very sweet. We stayed there all day while John tried to fix the engine.

When it started to get dark, John said it was a miracle the van had made it that far. My mum made a bed for us on the hotel's outdoor patio, and we slept there that night. The next day, John decided to have our van towed to Marrakech. We followed the tow truck in a car, and my sister sat in the front with the driver. I was worried about how we would get home now that our van was broken. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Eventually, I fell asleep.

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom. One was from Tokyo and the other was from a European city. They were both older than Lucy and good at speaking English. They talked about the music they were playing, where they had traveled, and where they were going next. Lucy mentioned that she was going to Tanglewood, which sounded impressive. However, she didn't really want to go to the festival. She had been traveling a lot for concerts and competitions, but she had missed a lot of school and wasn't officially enrolled anymore. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco.

Lucy's mother had actually filled out the application form for the Prague Festival without asking Lucy if she wanted to apply. Lucy's mom said she didn't want Lucy to be disappointed if she didn't get in. Lucy felt that her mom was trying to control her. The pianist from Tokyo asked Lucy how old she was, and she said 15. He exchanged a look with the other pianist, who said ""Wow"". Lucy didn't mean to brag, but it can be hard to know how much to share about her accomplishments.

Lucy's grandfather took her away from the conversation and told her not to get too friendly with the other pianists. He said everyone is the competition. Lucy's grandfather made her talk to important people at the party, and she smiled and nodded a lot. In the elevator, her grandfather told her that she did well and that people knew who she was. Lucy liked being recognized and respected, even if some people were jealous or thought she was too young to get that kind of attention.

'My dad says I should spend less time online and more time in the real world. But I decided to find out what experts say about the impact of social media on teenagers. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of friends, a sense of identity, and are developing important skills for the digital age. Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says that social media is a natural part of modern childhood. Teenagers don't just use social media occasionally, like adults do; they live it. Whether this is good or bad depends on how they use it.

Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, compares social media to hanging out at the youth club, where people used to go to share jokes and gossip. He says it helps teenagers develop their sense of identity and learn to deal with teenage issues. Professor Keith Davidson, a psychologist, agrees that social media can help teenagers develop their identity and self-confidence. He says that social media allows people to express themselves and connect with others who share similar interests.

Professor Andrew Phillips, who studies how younger people use social media, thinks it can be helpful for quiet people with specialized interests. He says that social media allows them to connect with others who share similar interests and feel part of a community. Pauline White, an expert on digital education, thinks that social media is becoming a creative force. Teenagers are using social media to make videos, podcasts, and blogs about things they're interested in. This is transforming creativity and will benefit them in the workplace.

In the future, social media will be an important tool for businesses to sell products and increase brand awareness. Teenagers who use social media creatively will have an advantage in the job market. Jim Matthews agrees that collaboration is a key skill in the digital age, and social media provides opportunities for people to work together and share their ideas.'

When most people think of a family vacation, they don't usually imagine a road trip across nine US states and a Canadian province. But my parents had other plans for our summer vacation this year. They wanted to do something different, something that would bring us closer together as a family. My dad took charge of planning the trip, and I was a bit worried. He kept saying, ""Not many people do this anymore,"" and my brother and I exchanged skeptical glances. We packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and clothes for all kinds of weather, and set off on our adventure.

As we drove west, we had some exciting experiences. We got caught in a dust storm in Oklahoma and had to stop for the night under the stars. We learned that in the country, cows have the right of way on the roads! The next day, we continued driving, and the landscape changed from deserts to mountains. We visited the Great Sand Dunes and the town of Pagosa Springs, Colorado, where we could smell the sulfur in the air. We also saw some amazing natural beauty, like the wind farms and the mountains.

As we traveled, we had some close calls, like when we almost got blown off the road in a dust storm and when we encountered a bear on the road. But we also had some great times, like when we visited Yellowstone National Park and watched the sunset over the bear habitats. We even had some unexpected adventures, like when we got stuck in traffic behind a park ranger who was letting a bear cross the road.

After two weeks on the road, we finally returned home. It was bittersweet to be back, but I was glad we had done something special together as a family. We took over 3,000 photos during our trip, and I know that the memories I'll keep are the ones that were unplanned and spontaneous.

Her mother, Dahlia, would join him, but Rose and her older sister, Amy, would stay in England. Amy was finishing her final school year and would live with the college head. Rose would live with her grandmother, who had offered her a place to stay.

Rose had never really known her grandfather, and her memories of her grandmother were from a few happy holidays when she was younger. Her parents didn't think it was a good idea for Rose to live with her grandmother, but Daisy insisted it was no trouble and wanted to get to know her granddaughter again.

Rose's parents had a disagreement with her grandmother in the past, which is why Rose hadn't spent holidays with her. But Rose was excited to live with her grandmother, who was a social person who loved to bring people together. Rose's grandmother was not like the typical old lady, and Rose thought it would be fun to live with her.

Before moving, Rose's parents had a talk with her about living with her grandmother. Rose was responsible and mature for her age, and she knew how to take care of herself. She wanted to have some independence, so she could play her music loud, invite friends over, and go out without needing permission every time. Her grandmother agreed, and Rose's parents gave her a new phone with a camera for emergencies.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

As we prepared to ski-jump, our instructor, Gareth, reminded us that speed is not the enemy, but our friend. One of my fellow skiers, David, who had experience with freestyle skiing, went first. He hit the ramp fast, but lost his skis and fell. Gareth's comment was, ""Speed is an unpredictable beast."" I realized that I wasn't cut out for freestyle skiing, which is very different from the skiing I was used to.

I had always thought freestyle skiing looked fun, but I wasn't sure if I was good enough. I had never tried it before, and I was worried about looking silly in front of the other skiers. My parents decided to take us to a training center in the US, where we could learn freestyle skiing. The center had an indoor facility with trampolines and artificial snow, where students could practice their tricks. After practicing indoors, we went outside to try it on the real slopes.

Gareth told us that the center's slogan, ""Progression is inevitable,"" was true. Before this center was built, inexperienced skiers would just ski down the mountain and hope for the best. But now, we could learn how to ski-jump safely. Gareth warned us that if we hit the ""knuckle"" (the flat part of the jump), we would be in trouble. The key is to hit the landing zone, where our motion continues forward and we can absorb the impact.

At first, it was hard for me to convince my body to ski fast towards the jump. My legs would freeze up, and I would come crashing down onto the knuckle. I managed not to fall, but I was exhausted by the end of the day. Gareth told us that we need to control the jump, not let it control us.

The next day, we started on the trampolines. I was surprised to find that I enjoyed bouncing on the trampolines. We did drills that mimicked ski-jumping moves, and others that helped us develop ""aerial awareness,"" or the ability to know what our body is doing as we spin in the air. Gareth gave us feedback, and I realized that my aerial awareness needed work. We went back to the mountain and tried again, with more setbacks before I finally landed properly. Gareth was happy for me, and I felt proud of myself. But my joy was short-lived, as I soon lost my skis again.<|eot_id|>"

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your palms are sweaty with fear, and you're gripping the harness tightly. The ride comes to a stop, and then suddenly drops down, making your stomach feel like it's in the air. You're scared, but you know it's your own fault for getting on the ride. Amusement parks are a huge industry, and behind the scenes, there are many people working together to create thrilling rides. These include engineers, designers, and marketing experts. 

Rollercoaster designers are responsible for creating the perfect balance between excitement and safety. They need to ensure that riders are not in danger while also introducing new and exciting elements to keep visitors coming back. Although rollercoasters have become more intense over time, many of the techniques used today were invented decades ago. 

I spoke to three experts who design rollercoasters. According to Professor Brendan Walker, a thrill engineer, the key is to combine different elements in a way that creates a thrilling experience. Dr. John Roberts, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, added that the goal is to create a sense of being thrown around while still feeling safe. It's a fine line between thrill and discomfort. 

To create the perfect ride, designers need to piece together a strong narrative, such as a space adventure or a jungle chase, that works with the ride's innovations. Professor Walker believes that gut instincts, experience, and trial-and-error are what ultimately work. Jeff Hornick, a senior director of theme park development, agrees that designers need to understand what passengers want and test their rides before opening them to the public. 

I asked the experts if rollercoaster designers would also need to incorporate new technologies like virtual reality. Professor Walker said that while virtual reality can add a new layer, it's not a replacement for the physical experience of riding a rollercoaster. He believes that the physical coaster experience will remain the best way to thrill riders for many years to come.<|eot_id|>"

Miranda Ellington is a successful choreographer at 25. She has worked with many theaters and dance companies. Despite her busy schedule, she still dances occasionally. I was surprised to hear that she combines both activities. She told me that dancing reminds her of her own experiences as a dancer and how demanding choreographers can be.

As a choreographer, Miranda enjoys working with young students. They are open to new ideas and willing to take risks. She finds it easier to work with them than with professional dancers, who may have strong opinions and be more set in their ways.

When Miranda creates a new dance piece, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. She tries to find a good match between the two. Sometimes, the music is not her favorite, but she still creates a great dance routine. If the dancers don't like the music, she has to find a way to make it work.

Miranda doesn't like to work with the same group all the time. She likes to meet new people and work with different styles and methods. This means she has to adapt her approach each time she starts a new project.

We talked about a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda said it was a realistic portrayal of life in a dance company. She appreciated how it showed the hard work and dedication required to be a professional dancer.

I asked Miranda what makes a great ballet or dance production. She said it's when everything comes together - the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. She believes that aiming high is important, even if it's not perfect. Sometimes, a small mistake can ruin the whole production.

Miranda has worked on many different projects and doesn't want to be labeled as a specific type of choreographer. She wants to continue exploring different styles and genres.

I once had a conversation with a friend about why I like to travel. They asked me why I bother when I can watch amazing things on TV. I agreed that TV can be great, but I think it's more exciting to experience things firsthand. This conversation inspired me to plan a unique trip. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, and I thought it would be a great idea to take it with me on my journey. I fixed the sofa's wheels and connected it to seatbelts, which I wore over my shoulders. I packed my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, even on the beach one night. Some friends joined me along the way, helping me pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. This trip was different from my usual walking expeditions because it was the longest distance I've ever walked and I got to stop at cafes and restaurants along the way. People would often ask me why I was doing this, and I'd say it wasn't for charity or training for a marathon – I just wanted to have a unique adventure. Now, when people ask me about my weekend, I'd rather tell them about dragging a sofa across southern England than talk about the latest TV show.

When I read about guided swimming trips in the Greek islands, I got excited. I'd never gone on an organized group trip before. My brother was busy, so I thought a group holiday might be a good idea. The man at the port was surprised when I asked for a single ticket, as the islands are popular with families. I explained that I would be joining a group of ten people for a swimming trip. Although he looked puzzled, he smiled and showed me on board. Before we started swimming, our guides explained that a support boat would be with us throughout the trip and taught us how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to split into groups based on our speed, and then it was time for our first 1.5 km swim. I was a bit nervous because I'd never swum long distances in the open sea before. As the waves got bigger, I found myself at the back of the slow group. I was disappointed, but I was determined to complete the distance on my own. I was relieved when I finally finished it. The next few days followed a routine: we'd jump in, swim at a comfortable pace, and stop to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, I got faster and enjoyed completing them more. By the end, I didn't really need the support boat. I'm already looking forward to coming back next year.

Becoming a flight attendant isn't easy, but I've loved my experience so far. I've traveled all around the world, from the US to Australia, and I've worked with amazing people. Plus, I get a lot of time off, which is great for someone my age. When I was a child, I attended a boarding school abroad, so I often flew alone. I would ask the flight attendants if I could help serve meals to passengers, and some of them let me. This experience stuck with me, and when I decided to leave my job in banking, I remembered how much I enjoyed working in the airline industry.

At the summer camp where I work, it's wonderful to see children achieve things they never thought they could do. Most of the children are already good at swimming and table tennis, but rock climbing is a new experience for them. Some kids get nervous at first, but with encouragement, they all manage to reach the top and feel proud of themselves. We do encounter children who miss their homes at the beginning, especially the 10- to 13-year-olds. We don't let them use their phones all the time. First, we allow them to call home after lunch, and then after dinner, we remind them it's getting late and they can try again the next day. Most children settle in within a couple of days, and by the end of their stay, they all thank us for the great time they had. It's not just the children who feel homesick. We also get parents who call us constantly, asking how their child is doing. This is often unnecessary, as their child might be busy playing or doing something else. We have to politely ask the parents to call back another time. We also get children who come dressed in expensive new clothes. These kids often argue when we ask them to change into more suitable clothes, but they soon understand the reason why.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Rock the Planet, a musical show that combines acting and music, opened in London after a successful run in the USA. The show features a British cast of actors, but it was challenging to find enough talented performers. In the UK, there are limits on how many performances young actors can do each week, whereas in the USA, they can do more shows. As a result, twice as many actors were needed for the London production. The director found plenty of talented British actors, and the show has just won its first ""Best Musical"" award. The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, but it's been fully booked every night, with audiences eager to hear the popular songs from the show.

I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He told me how much he enjoys getting paid to play his guitar, especially his expensive Gibson guitar. He said that the young actors have normal school lessons during the day, but they miss their old classmates. The show's special deals on tickets for schools have been popular, and Jamie's whole class came to see the show. His parents attend when they can, but it's expensive for them.

When I mentioned that I play guitar too, Jamie offered to let me play along with him and the other young actors. We played a song called ""Days,"" and Jamie helped me get the hang of it. I was impressed by his skills and felt happy to have tried. The young actors had never played in a band before, but they found it easy to adapt. The hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together - they were concentrating so hard that they forgot to smile!

The show will continue to run in London for another year, and I highly recommend it.<|eot_id|>"
