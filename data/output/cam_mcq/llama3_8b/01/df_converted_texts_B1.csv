Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of sharing where you are online. The site said that when you tell people you're at a certain place, you're also telling everyone else, not just your friends. This made people realize that sharing everything online can have negative consequences.

The internet has given us many opportunities to share our lives with others, but it can also be dangerous. We can share photos, stories, and thoughts with a huge audience, but we might not always think about the consequences. It's like throwing things into a crowded and treacherous ocean without a map.

A group of early internet users, called bloggers, have already gone through this experience. They shared their lives online years ago, before social media was invented. They faced problems like losing friends, getting in trouble, and dealing with the pressure of being famous.

One blogger, Justin Hall, started sharing his life online in 1994. He wrote about his daily life, including his relationships and personal struggles. He even shared his art and photos. People loved his blog, but he faced problems when he wrote about his love life. His partner didn't want him to share their relationship online, so he had to stop blogging.

Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, had a similar experience. She wrote about her job and personal life on her blog, but her boss found out and she lost her job. This is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they wouldn't say in person.

The article concludes that the internet is not a separate reality where we can be reckless. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and we need to be careful about what we share. Armstrong learned this the hard way, but she eventually found a way to manage her online presence and build a successful career as a blogger. The article suggests that we can all learn from her experience and be more thoughtful about what we share online.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a B1 level learner:

A while ago, some scientists started talking about a low-budget movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? It's a mix of documentary and drama that shows how much we don't understand about the universe. Scientists are not perfect and don't know everything, so they might not agree with everything the movie says. Some scientists were worried about the movie and called it ""atrocious"" or ""dangerous"". This made me curious, so I watched the movie.

At first, I didn't see what all the fuss was about. Scientists were talking about new discoveries that showed the universe is stranger than we thought. But then the movie talked about some amazing discoveries, like how water molecules can be affected by our thoughts. I had heard about this before, but I didn't know if it was true. The movie showed some pictures of ice crystals that looked different depending on the mood of the person talking to them. Some people find this kind of evidence convincing, but scientists want more proof.

The movie claimed that water is affected by thoughts, which is an amazing idea with big implications. But scientists want to see more proof before they believe it. The pictures of crystals are nice, but they're not enough. The real problem is that the movie didn't go far enough. The truth is that scientists are making new discoveries that show the universe is even stranger than we thought.

For example, scientists have found that the universe is made of a type of matter we don't understand, and it's being pushed by a mysterious force called ""dark energy"". They've also found that our brains take a little time to process what's happening, and that our ancestors left Africa a long time ago to populate the world. And some scientists think they've found a link between the existence of life on Earth and the design of the universe.

The point is that science is not finished. We still have a lot to learn, and some things will always be a mystery. This is why some scientists are trying to create a ""Theory of Everything"" that explains all the forces and particles in the universe. For many of us, the universe is best summed up in one word: incredible.<|eot_id|>"

Writing novels is a big challenge for me, but writing short stories is much easier. It's like comparing planting a forest to planting a garden. Both are important, but they require different skills. When I finish a novel, I like to write some short stories. When I finish a group of short stories, I feel like writing a novel again. I never write short stories while I'm working on a novel, and I never write a novel while I'm working on short stories. 

I started writing short stories in 1984. It was a new experience for me, and it took some time to get used to. But it was worth it. I felt like I could explore new ideas and characters. My readers seemed to enjoy my short stories too.

One of the best things about writing short stories is that they don't take as long to finish. I can usually write a short story in about a week. It's a nice change of pace from writing a novel, which can take months or even years. I like that I can write short stories quickly and then move on to something new.

I also like that I can write short stories about small things that come to me, like an idea or a word. It's like improvising with music. And if a short story doesn't turn out well, I don't worry about it. I can just try again. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't write perfect short stories all the time.

For me, short stories are like a laboratory where I can try out new ideas and characters. They help me become a better novelist. I'm happy to be able to share my short stories with readers and hope they enjoy them.

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a B1 learner:

Science is a complex and powerful tool that helps us understand the world. It can be abstract and difficult to grasp, but it has many practical applications that make our lives better. Science has helped us cure diseases, understand the universe, and even manipulate the world around us.

However, science is not always easy to understand, and it can be misunderstood or overestimated. Scientists often disagree with each other, and their theories can change over time. This can be confusing, but it's also a sign of progress.

Science has changed our understanding of the world many times. In the past, people thought the universe was a simple clockwork machine, but now we know that it's much more complex. We've also discovered many new things, such as radioactivity, X-rays, and black holes.

Science is not just for scientists; it affects everyone. It's important for us to understand what scientists are doing and how it will affect our lives. We need to be aware of the benefits and risks of scientific discoveries, and we need to make sure that science is used responsibly.

In the past, scientists thought they had discovered everything, but then new discoveries were made. Today, there are still many things we don't know, and scientists are working to find the answers. We can't afford to ignore science; it's an important part of our future.

Here is a simplified version of the text for a B1 level learner:

For many years, book sales were growing. But from around 2015, some big book publishers started to say that ebook sales were not growing as much as they used to. In fact, some even said that ebook sales were going down. This made people wonder if ebooks would eventually replace print books. One person in the publishing industry said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to bad investments, and that their company lost faith in the power of printed books.

Despite all the evidence showing that digital and print books can coexist, people still wonder if ebooks will eventually replace print books. This idea is very interesting because it makes us think about our feelings about change and new technology. In the past, people have always worried that new technologies would replace old ones. For example, when television was invented, some people thought radio would disappear. But radio actually survived and found new uses.

The idea that one medium will replace another is not new. People have been predicting the end of books since the 19th century. They thought that audiobooks would replace printed books. Similarly, when movies and television were invented, people thought they would replace live performances. But they didn't.

When new technologies come out, we often feel a mix of excitement and fear. We form strong bonds with the things we use every day, like books, TVs, and computers. So, when something new comes along, we have to adjust to it and may feel a sense of loss for what we had before. That's why we often see a revival of older technologies or products. For example, when digital cameras came out, people started to appreciate the quality of film cameras again.

The idea of a medium disappearing will continue to be an interesting topic. It makes us think about the power of technology and our fear of change. We use stories and patterns to make sense of change, and the story of the death of the book is a common one. It's a story that reflects our excitement about what's new and our fear of losing things that are important to us.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

I spent a year and a half writing about how famous people from the past 400 years managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. I looked at when they slept, ate, worked, and worried. I wanted to show how their daily habits helped them be successful. This book is about how people make time for their best work, not just the work itself.

I struggled with the same questions in my own life: How can I do creative work and still earn a living? Should I focus on one project or do many small tasks? When there's not enough time, what do I give up? I didn't answer these questions, but I shared how successful people handled these challenges.

The book's title is ""Daily Rituals"", but I focused on people's routines. A routine can be ordinary, but it can also help you make the most of your time, energy, and motivation. A good routine can even help you overcome bad moods.

I started writing this book because I was procrastinating on a project. I was supposed to finish it the next day, but instead, I tidied my office, made coffee, and wasted the day. I realized that many writers have interesting routines, so I started a blog to collect these stories. This book is an expanded version of that blog, with more information and quotes from the people I wrote about.

I used research from many other writers, journalists, and scholars to write this book. I included a list of sources at the end, so you can learn more about these people and their routines.<|eot_id|>"

Howard became interested in being a palaeontologist when he was six years old. His father had to cancel their holiday to Spain because of high interest rates, so they went to the beach instead. Howard found an ammonite on the beach and knew he wanted to become a palaeontologist. He studied fossils and became interested in the earliest creatures. After finishing university, he wasn't sure if he would get a job. He applied for a job at Tavistock College in London, but wasn't very hopeful. The professor who was supposed to interview him got into a fight with his wife and wasn't able to attend the interview. Howard was surprised when he got the job, but later found out that the professor who replaced him was a rival who wanted to help his own student. Howard was happy to have the job and be able to do the work he loved. 

Later, Howard's briefcase containing his lecture notes was stolen at a train station. He was angry and had to cancel his lecture. He went to get a coffee and met a colleague who was with a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that he could study and that would help him in his career. He decided to change his plans and go to Nairobi instead of attending a conference in Stockholm or taking a field trip to Scotland. He wanted to study the fossils and make the most of this opportunity.

Professor Charles Spence loves to eat unusual foods. He even has a special ice cream made from bee larvae at home. He thinks it tastes a bit nutty and floral. Professor Spence is a psychologist who studies how our senses work together to make food taste good. He wants to make food more enjoyable and healthy. He works with big food companies to help them create new and tasty products.

Professor Spence has found many interesting things about how we eat. For example, the person who orders first in a restaurant usually likes their food the most. We also eat more food when we're with other people. He has a special lab at Oxford University where he does his research. It's not very high-tech, but it's perfect for him.

Professor Spence works with famous chefs and food companies to make their products better. He helps them reduce salt and sugar in their food. He thinks it's important to make healthy food taste good. He also works with a famous chef named Heston Blumenthal to create new and interesting dishes.

Professor Spence has discovered some surprising things about how our senses work. For example, he found that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while low-pitched music makes it taste bitter. He thinks that music can greatly affect how we enjoy our food.

In his free time, Professor Spence likes to have dinner parties with his family. They like to try new and unusual foods. They even play with music and lights to see how it affects their taste. Professor Spence loves his job and is always looking for new ways to make food more enjoyable and healthy.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a B1 learner:

Our brains are very busy. We have a lot of information coming at us from different sources, and we need to sort through it all to find what we need. At the same time, we're doing more things on our own, like booking flights and buying things online. We're like superheroes, doing many tasks at once, but our brains aren't really designed for this. 

We think we're multitasking, but really we're just switching between tasks quickly. This can be stressful and make it harder to focus. It's like trying to juggle many balls at once - we might drop some. 

When we multitask, our brains produce more stress hormones, which can make us feel overwhelmed and confused. It's like our brains are addicted to constant stimulation. 

The part of our brain that helps us focus can get easily distracted by new things, like a shiny object. This means it's hard to stay focused on one task. 

Research shows that multitasking can actually make us less efficient and less intelligent. It's like trying to learn new things while watching TV - the information goes to the wrong part of our brain. 

We also make a lot of small decisions every day, like answering emails, which can be tiring for our brains. This can lead to making bad decisions about important things. 

Many people feel overwhelmed by the number of emails they receive. It's not that we don't like email, but it's hard to keep up with it all. We feel like we need to respond to every email, but it's hard to do that and get anything else done.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for a B1 learner:

Do animals have feelings and moral values? Fifty years ago, scientists thought animals just acted on instinct and didn't have feelings or thoughts. But now, research is showing that animals can have emotions and even moral values.

For example, a chimpanzee named Santino at a Swedish zoo would break up concrete to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being naughty or just having fun? Similarly, some female bats help other bats find their babies even if they're not related. Are they being kind or just helping out?

Scientists have been studying the behavior of animals like bats, chimpanzees, rats, dolphins, and even chickens to understand their emotions. This research has led to a debate about whether animals have consciousness, or the ability to think and feel.

Some scientists think that animals can have moral values and should be treated with respect. For example, a recent experiment showed that cows that opened a locked gate to get food were happier than those who didn't. If cows enjoy solving problems, does that mean we should treat them better?

Not everyone agrees on what this means. Some scientists think we should stop eating meat because animals have feelings and moral values. Others think we should just be more careful about how we treat animals. The debate is not just about science, but also about our values and how we live our lives.

The article also talks about a study that showed that starlings can get depressed if they live in small, unpleasant cages. This raises questions about how we treat animals and whether we should be more compassionate towards them.

Overall, the debate about animal consciousness is complex and contentious. While scientists continue to study animals, we need to think carefully about our values and how we treat animals.<|eot_id|>"

Critical thinking is when we try to understand something deeply by analyzing it. Adrian West, a researcher, believes that argument is a way to find the truth. However, he also thinks that technology is changing the way we think. We are exposed to a lot of information, but it can be difficult to make sense of it all. West says that the wealth of information can overwhelm our ability to reason.

Many people think that the more information we have, the better we will be at making decisions. But this is not always true. In fact, the National Endowment for the Arts has found that people are reading less, and this might be affecting their ability to think critically.

Patricia Greenfield, a professor of psychology, agrees that technology is changing the way we think. She says that people are spending more time on visual media, such as video games and TV, and less time reading. This can make it harder for people to focus and think deeply.

Greenfield has studied how technology affects learning and has found that reading is better for developing critical thinking skills than visual media. Reading helps people develop their imagination, vocabulary, and ability to think deeply. However, some visual media can improve certain types of information processing.

The way we use technology affects how we think. For example, video games can be both good and bad for critical thinking. Some games can help people develop decision-making and analytical skills, while others might not be as helpful.

James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, agrees that video games can be a good tool for learning. He says that games like Sim City and Civilization can help people develop critical thinking skills by teaching them to make decisions and analyze situations.

It's clear that technology is changing the way we think, and it's important to understand how it affects our ability to think critically.<|eot_id|>"

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic and a writer. He wrote a book about the benefits of doing manual work. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life. He got the idea for the book when he noticed that ads started popping up on his credit card machine while he was waiting. He thought that these distractions were becoming too common and making it hard for us to think and focus.

We are constantly being interrupted by ads and notifications on our phones, social media, and other devices. This makes it hard for us to focus on what's important. We are also becoming less able to have simple conversations with strangers because we are too busy with our phones.

Matthew Crawford is not the only one who is worried about this. Many people feel the same way. They know that it's hard to focus when there are too many distractions. In fact, research has shown that even having a phone nearby can make it hard to concentrate.

Crawford thinks that technology has made it easy for us to avoid dealing with the world around us. We can just use our phones to do everything, instead of interacting with real people. He gives the example of a gym where people used to listen to music together, but now everyone listens to their own music on headphones. This has made the gym less social.

Crawford suggests that we need to find ways to engage with the world in a more meaningful way. He thinks that doing things that require skill and attention, like cooking or playing sports, can help us develop our judgment and ability to focus. When we do these things, we realize that manufactured experiences, like video games or social media, are not as satisfying as real experiences.

It's not about becoming a professional chef or athlete, but about finding ways to use our judgment and focus on what's important. Constantly resisting distractions can be exhausting, but paying attention to one thing can make it easier to pay attention to others.<|eot_id|>"

'What do you do for a living?' is a common question we ask to get to know someone. But when you're a philosopher, it's harder to answer. People often think that philosophers are special and have a deep understanding of life. But that's not true. Philosophers are just people who think deeply about life and try to make sense of the world.

Many people think that philosophers are remote from everyday life, but that's not necessarily true. Philosophers can be part of the community and think about the things that matter to us all. In fact, philosophy can help us make better decisions and live a more meaningful life.

Some people think that philosophy is only about reading books and being an expert. But that's not true. Philosophy is about thinking deeply about the things that matter to us, like our values and beliefs. It's about examining our own lives and the world around us.

I'm a philosopher, and I think that philosophy should be accessible to everyone. It's not just for experts or academics. Philosophy can help us make sense of the world and live a better life.<|eot_id|>"

Food and eating are important topics that can bring people together. However, philosophers have not always talked about food in a deep way. Instead, they have used food as a metaphor for other ideas. This is changing, and now people are starting to think about food in a more serious way.

Epicurus, an ancient Greek philosopher, believed that people should pursue pleasure and avoid pain. He thought this applied to all aspects of life, including food and drink. Today, his name is often associated with a love of eating and drinking. This is because food and drink can bring us joy and pleasure.

Food is also a social and cultural activity. We eat with others and share food with our communities. This is why food is an important topic for philosophers to explore.

Food critics, who write about food, have a special job. They are good at describing the taste and quality of food. However, philosophers think that anyone can learn to describe food well, and that it's not a special skill.

Food is also related to aesthetics, or the appreciation of beauty. Some people think that food can be beautiful, like a work of art. However, food is eaten and destroyed, so it's not the same as other beautiful things that can be kept and appreciated over time.

There are also many ethical questions about food. For example, what should we eat? Should we choose food that is organic, free-range, or locally grown? These questions reveal our values and beliefs.

Cooking is also an important part of food. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests, because they are cooking for people they care about. Restaurant cooks, on the other hand, have different responsibilities to their employers and the food they prepare.

Food can also bring people together across cultures. For example, sharing a meal with someone from another culture can help us understand and appreciate their customs and traditions. This is an important part of international diplomacy.

Overall, food is an important topic that can bring people together and make us think about our values and beliefs.<|eot_id|>"

Rob Daviau, an American, creates new types of board games called 'legacy' games. He thought traditional board games were too easy and boring. He wanted to make games with a story and where players' decisions had a lasting impact. He created a new version of the classic game Risk, called Risk Legacy. Players make decisions that affect the game permanently. They might tear up cards or damage the board. The game is played over several sessions, and players can see how their decisions affect the game.

Daviau was asked to work on a legacy version of another popular game, Pandemic. Players work together to stop diseases from spreading. His next project was a game called SeaFall, set in the age of sail. Players become sailors and explore the world. Designers of legacy games need to think about all the possible choices players can make to keep the story interesting.

To test the game, designers play the game many times and see how it unfolds. Jaime Barriga, a play-tester, said it takes a lot of time and effort. The game can start well, but then things can go wrong. Designers need to fix the problems and make the game fun again.

Not everyone expected legacy games to be popular. Daviau thought it would be a niche interest. But many players loved the concept. Russell Chapman said it's a big advance in game design. Ben Hogg liked the idea of an unfolding adventure and didn't mind making changes to the game. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, compared the legacy design process to writing a novel. Daviau hopes others will continue to create new and exciting games.

Colby Dauch, a game publisher, thinks the legacy format has changed the way people think about board games. He's excited to see what new games will be created.<|eot_id|>"

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium. He crawled across the floor and slipped into a small drain that led to the ocean. This is a fun story that many people enjoyed sharing online. People like to imagine that animals are like us, and octopuses are especially interesting because they are very smart and have bodies that are very different from ours. How can eight-tentacled sea creatures open jars, recognize faces, and even play games? Some people think that imagining animals are like us is not scientific, but a scientist named Dr. Frans de Waal says it's actually the opposite - not recognizing the human-like traits of animals, or what he calls ""anthropodenial"" - that is unscientific.

Dr. de Waal studied many animals, including gorillas and chimpanzees, and found that they can do many things that were thought to be unique to humans, such as thinking about the past and future, feeling empathy, and understanding what others are thinking. Animals are smarter than we often give them credit for. In the past, people thought animals were intelligent and could even be put on trial for crimes. Even Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, believed that animals and humans are not that different.

However, in the 20th century, scientists started to view animals as just machines that respond to rewards and punishments. This changed the way people thought about animal intelligence. It's no surprise that this happened during a time when humans were harming animals and the environment. But Dr. de Waal thinks that we are now starting to understand animal intelligence better. He believes that animals are not just different from us, but are on the same spectrum, just at a different point. The best way to test animal intelligence is to design tests that are specific to each species. For example, squirrels are great at remembering where they hide their food, while humans need apps to find their phones.

Dr. de Waal is skeptical about Inky's escape story, but he knows that stories like this can make people appreciate animal intelligence. He once did an experiment to see if monkeys can feel envy. When the monkeys were given cucumbers or grapes, those who got cucumbers got angry when they saw their friends getting grapes. The study was published in a scientific journal, but a short video clip of the experiment really made people understand the results. This shows how our minds work in a unique way.<|eot_id|>"

Robots are going to change the way we work and live. They will be used in many industries, not just manufacturing and cars. Experts think that robots will soon be used in many jobs that humans do today. Some people think that robots will take over most jobs, but many people also think that their jobs will stay the same. However, this is not true. Robots will change many jobs, including jobs in supermarkets, homes, and offices.

For example, a company in Australia has made a robot that can lay bricks much faster than humans. A robot in a supermarket can make sure the shelves are stocked and clean. Some people think that robots will create new jobs for technicians and programmers, but others worry that robots will take away jobs that need human skills.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang is an expert on robotics and thinks that robots will change the way we work. He says that robots will become smarter and work with other robots and humans. Many companies will need people who know how to work with robots, and governments will need to make new laws to keep us safe.

Dr. Zhang also says that people will need to learn new skills to work with robots. Some jobs will be taken away, but new jobs will be created. He thinks that people should not hope that their jobs will stay the same, but should learn new skills to adapt to the changes.

In the future, we will see robots that can move around like humans and interact with us in new ways. This will bring new opportunities for companies, but also new challenges, like making sure we are safe and private.

Many people wonder why climbers risk their lives to climb mountains. One famous climber, George Mallory, replied, ""Because it's there."" This answer might inspire some people to pursue their dreams, but it's also true that climbing is a fun and exciting adventure.

A Bolivian writer, Tejada-Flores, wrote an essay about climbing and identified seven different types of climbing, each with its own rules. He said that the way you climb depends on the type of climbing you're doing.

For many climbers, the joy of climbing comes from the feeling of freedom it gives them. However, climbing can also be confining and restrictive, especially when you're stuck in a tent during a storm.

There is a paradox in climbing - it can be both freeing and restrictive. But some people argue that the simplicity of climbing gives them a sense of freedom.

A US rock climber, Joe Fitschen, asked a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He said that climbing is in our nature - we have an instinct to take risks and challenge ourselves.

Another expert, Brian Treanor, believes that climbing helps us develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. Climbing can also help us develop these qualities in our everyday lives.

Some climbers think that climbing is more meaningful when you do it on your own, without relying on others or technology. This can make the achievement feel more special and deserving of recognition.

Climbing can also be a way to connect with nature and be in the moment. It requires physical effort, problem-solving, and focus, which can be meditative. In fact, some people compare climbing to Zen philosophy, which aims to help people achieve a state of inner peace.

When asking why people climb, we can consider these different perspectives and ideas.<|eot_id|>"

Alfred Brendel was a famous pianist who performed classical music for many years. He was a serious and dedicated person who loved to study and play the piano. Brendel didn't teach many students, but he did take on a young boy named Kit Armstrong when Kit was 14. Kit was an exceptional pianist who could play many pieces by heart. Brendel was impressed by Kit's talent and decided to teach him.

Kit is now 19 and is still learning from Brendel. He is a hard worker and likes to learn new things, such as languages, math, and computer programming. He also likes to play tennis and compose music. Brendel is proud of Kit's progress and says that he has a great memory and can listen to his own playing and learn from it.

Brendel is careful not to raise expectations too high for Kit. He knows that young musicians can be talented in some areas but still need time to develop in others. He wants Kit to focus on improving and not get too stressed about being perfect.

When I was a child, I thought all gardens were beautiful and peaceful. My grandad's garden was special because it was near a river. You couldn't reach the river, but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds singing in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this. My grandad's garden wasn't special because of fancy things like a greenhouse. He just had a normal garden. My dad was a quiet person, but he liked to make me laugh. He had funny phrases he used, like ""It's immaterial to me."" Deep down, he might have been a little sad that he didn't achieve his dreams. He left school without qualifications and became a plumber, which wasn't his passion. He wasn't ambitious, but he was good at fixing things around the house. My parents moved house only once, but my mom loved buying new furniture. She would often surprise us with new things. We got a piano, but I was too scared to play it. My sister got lessons, and I was never allowed to play. When I asked my mom why, she said I wouldn't have practiced.

I loved playing near the river. I would go there with a fishing net and imagine I was in another world. I would walk along the riverbank, looking for a good spot to take off my shoes and put them with my picnic. I would look for fish and try to catch them with my net. After a few tries, I gave up keeping them alive and put them back in the river. I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely. Then my dad told me about a job as an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. He thought I might be interested. I like to think that deep down, he wanted me to be happy and do something I loved.

Here is a simplified version of the text for a B1 learner:

Lawrence MacEwen lives on a small island called Muck, off the coast of Scotland. I visit him there. The weather is bad, with strong winds and rain. His sheepdog, Tie, is with him. MacEwen is happy to be on his island. He shows me around and tells me about the other islands nearby. He says that his family has lived on Muck for 3000 years.

We go to move the sheep, and Tie tries to herd them, but he does it badly. MacEwen is not happy. The Isle of Muck is a family business. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son, Colin, looks after the holiday cottages, and their daughter, Mary, runs a hotel with her husband, Toby.

Life on the island is different from what I'm used to. There is no electricity all the time, and we have to use torches at night. There is no mobile phone signal either. But everyone seems happy and content. We have a concert on the island, and it's a lot of fun.

One day, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. Her father bought a farm on another island without even seeing it, and Jenny was sent to manage it. She didn't know much about farming, but she was good at typing. I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I enjoy my time on the island, eating fresh food and spending time with the family.

The next day, I have to leave the island, but I'm a bit sad to go. The ferry ride is rough, and some of the ferries had been cancelled because of bad weather. If I didn't leave, I would have to stay on the island for two more days, which I would have liked.<|eot_id|>"

The video game industry used to be difficult to get into. Many people thought it was just a hobby for young people. But now, it's becoming more serious. Experts say it's not easy, but it's expanding.

To get into the industry, you need to be good at designing games. Jim Donelly, a spokesperson for a games magazine, says it's hard to get a job at a big company, but the industry needs more game designers. You don't need a degree in computer science to get started. Jim says the most important thing is to make games. You need to be creative and have a passion for it.

John Field, another expert, agrees that making games is important, but he thinks it's more complicated than that. You need to have the right skills, be creative, and have a good understanding of technology and art. You also need to be willing to learn and adapt to new things.

Some people think you can do it on your own, but it's not easy. A good postgraduate course in games can help, as well as connections and networking. Many game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up.

The video game industry is changing and growing. More people are playing games, and it's becoming a popular way to learn and have fun. John thinks there are many opportunities in the industry and that it will continue to grow.

Here is the simplified text for a B1 level learner:

I've always loved playing football since I was a child. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me to. I'm grateful for that. I had a friend who didn't enjoy playing because his dad was too pushy. He stopped playing and never got involved in football again. I'm glad it wasn't like that for me.

When I score a great goal from far away, people often say it's just luck. But it's not. I've practiced taking shots from a distance since I was a kid. Practice is important to score amazing goals.

As a professional footballer, I know that even the best players need to work hard to achieve their goals. I was taught good technique, not just natural talent. When I teach kids, I want them to enjoy learning and having fun.

I was a sporty kid and did many sports at school. I loved football the most. My teachers did a good job, but I didn't realize it at the time. Now, I want my son to have a good education and enjoy learning too.

When I started my professional career, our manager made sacrifices so we could play for the first team. He didn't make a big deal about it, but we knew we had to work hard. We lost our first game, but we didn't give up. I rely on my close friends and family, but having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems.

I like to help my family and friends, but I also want them to be independent. My mum works as a hairdresser and loves her job. I've helped my parents financially, but I don't want them to rely on me. After I stop playing football, I want to take a break and do things I haven't had time for before, like go skiing.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

We were living in Reef Point because of my father's agent, Sam Carter. My father and Sam had a big problem. My father couldn't write his book because he didn't like Los Angeles. Sam was worried that my father would lose his clients and money. So, Sam found us a cheap place to live in Reef Point.

Reef Point is a small beach town. It's not very popular with tourists because the road is not nice and there's a better beach nearby. But in the summer, more people come to the beach. My father was working hard to finish his book, and I would often go to the beach with my dog, Rusty. Rusty is a friendly dog who likes to dig and swim. He found us one day and decided to stay.

One day, a surfer girl came to the beach. She was very good at surfing and asked me to join her. I told her I didn't have a surfboard, and she said I could buy one. I told her I didn't have money, and she asked if my father was American. I said no, he was writing a book and had come to Reef Point to work. The girl was surprised and asked if my father was Rufus Marsh, the author of ""Tall as the Morning"". I said yes, and she seemed interested. She had read the book and liked it.

I made some changes to the text to make it easier for a B1 learner to understand:

* Simplified vocabulary: I used simpler words and phrases, such as ""cheap place to live"" instead of ""somewhere cheap"".
* Shortened sentences: I broke up long sentences into shorter ones to make them easier to follow.
* Removed complex phrases: I removed phrases like ""the warmth of the sun had been blanketed by sea fogs"" and replaced them with simpler language.
* Added context: I added a few words to help the reader understand the context, such as ""small beach town"" and ""friendly dog"".
* Simplified the language of the dialogue: I used simpler language in the dialogue, such as ""Hi, why didn't you join us?"" instead of ""Why didn't you join us?""<|eot_id|>"

Violet Hetherington was waiting in a long queue at the dock in Southampton. She was going on a cruise and was excited to get on the ship. But the queue was moving very slowly. Violet had been advised by her friend Annie to get to the dock late, but now she was regretting that advice. The queue was getting longer and longer, and an announcement came over the loudspeaker saying that there was a problem with the computer system. The atmosphere among the passengers became gloomy. Some people were getting impatient and frustrated.

Violet was feeling anxious and frustrated too. She had paid a lot of money for this trip and wanted to make the most of it. But now she was worried that she would not be able to get on the ship on time. To make matters worse, she realized that she had left her phone at home. This meant she couldn't call her sons to ask them to check if she had left it in the taxi.

Violet met a friendly couple behind her in the queue and asked to borrow their phone to call her son. She asked him to ask their neighbor to check if she had left her phone at home. Violet was relieved that she wouldn't have to deal with the problem in New York, where she would have no way of finding important phone numbers.

Finally, the queue started moving, and Violet was able to get on the ship. She was a bit disappointed when she saw the ship's foyer, which was not as luxurious as she had expected. But she was relieved to have finally made it to her room, which had a balcony as she had requested. She had been worried about what she would say if she didn't get the balcony, but now she was happy to have it.

John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction. He didn't know what he was getting. He was looking for pictures to use in a book about a neighborhood in Chicago. Instead, he found 30,000 photos taken by a street photographer named Vivian Maier. She was very good at taking interesting pictures.

John has been working to learn more about Vivian Maier. He has found many cameras, films, and negatives, as well as some movies and audio recordings. He has been talking to people who knew her and trying to figure out more about her life.

Vivian Maier was born in New York in 1926. She spent some time in France as a child. She came to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. She loved taking pictures and always had a camera with her. She would take pictures of people, children, and old buildings.

Vivian Maier was a private person, but she wasn't afraid to take pictures of people on the street. She even recorded some of their conversations on tape. She loved art and movies, and she was very good at taking pictures.

John Maloof thinks that Vivian Maier's work is very special. He wants to share her pictures with the world and make sure she is remembered. He is still working to learn more about her and her pictures.

Eleanor Catton's book, The Luminaries, is a big and complex novel. It's about a group of 12 men who try to solve a series of crimes in New Zealand in the 1860s. The story is very complicated, with many characters and twists. Catton wanted to write a murder mystery, but she found that the past offered many opportunities for misunderstandings and surprises.

The book is over 800 pages long, which is big because Catton wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a chance to be important. When I asked her about being successful at such a young age, she said it's nice to be from a small country where everyone feels like they're part of the success.

Catton also talked about her writing process. She wanted to write a book with a special structure, like a spiral. She didn't plan the whole book beforehand, but instead wrote herself into a difficult situation and then tried to find a way out. She also wanted to make the book fun to read.

We also talked about her love of TV drama series, which has cliffhangers, multiple viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she might want to write for TV, and she thought it could be cool. She's very enthusiastic and loves talking about her writing and New Zealand.

When I asked her about her plans for the future, she said she'll stay in New Zealand for now and continue to draw inspiration from the country. I hope she finds it helpful for her next books.

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

Jonny Kinkead has been making things with his hands since he was a boy. He loves building guitars and has been doing it for over 40 years. 'I'm still amazed by how you can create a beautiful sound just by putting together two pieces of wood,' he says.

When Jonny was 11, he started playing his brother's guitar. Later, at 16, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. Instead of buying one, he decided to build it himself. He studied guitars and learned how different types of wood and shapes affect the sound.

Jonny's brothers had also been making things, like model boats and planes, since they were kids. Their dad taught them how to use tools like saws and chisels. Jonny even fixed and customized instruments for his friends.

After finishing school, Jonny studied architecture at university, but he dropped out halfway through. He realized that he was too individualistic for the course. However, he gained a better understanding of what he wanted to do. He was interested in sculpture and design, and he saw that building guitars was a type of sculpture that involved creating sound.

Jonny has been making guitars for a living ever since. For the first 10 years, he also worked part-time cleaning windows. As he became famous for his guitars, he could charge more money for them. However, he still only makes about 10 guitars a year, which limits his earnings.

To get known, Jonny would attend music festivals and ask musicians to try out his guitars and tell their friends about him. He also had to learn how to price his instruments, which didn't come naturally to him.

Jonny thinks it's easier for new guitar-makers in the UK now. 'When I started, people thought that only American-made guitars were good,' he says. 'But now, our hand-made guitars have a good reputation.' He believes that you can learn valuable techniques in school, but also that trial and error is important. 'Look at other instruments, see what works and what doesn't, and try different things,' he says.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

When we talk about English conversation, we often start with the weather. This is because it's a traditional way to begin a conversation. Many people have noticed that when two English people meet, they usually talk about the weather first. This is still true today, even though it's been over 200 years since someone first pointed it out.

Some people try to explain why English people like talking about the weather so much. They think it's because the weather is interesting or exciting. But this isn't the real reason. In fact, English people don't really care about the weather itself. They talk about it because it's a way to make small talk and be friendly.

Talking about the weather is like a secret code that helps English people feel more comfortable with each other. It's a way to start a conversation or fill a silence. For example, saying ""Nice day, isn't it?"" is not really about the weather, but it's a way to say hello and make someone feel welcome.

There are certain situations where talking about the weather is expected. It can be used as a greeting, to break the ice, or to fill a silence. This is why some people might think that English people talk about the weather all the time. But really, it's just a way to be polite and friendly.

Alice Leader is a former teacher who loves teaching children. She took a group of 12- and 13-year-olds to visit Hadrian's Wall in Britain. The wall is an old Roman wall that is 120 km long and 5 meters high. The students were very interested in the wall, but they wanted to know why it was built. Alice couldn't find a good book to explain it, so she decided to write one herself.

After teaching for 31 years, Alice retired and started writing books for children. She wanted to write stories that are not too dark or too fantastical. She believes that children's books often focus too much on negative experiences or magic. Alice's books are different because they are based on real events and people.

Alice used to teach English and History together. She loved seeing children go from being bored to being interested in a subject. She loves making learning fun. Writing books is similar to teaching, but it's less tiring. Alice's husband, Zachary Leader, is a writer and editor who helps her with her books. He gives her good advice on how to make her writing better.

Alice wrote her first book after taking a creative writing course. The course was a big help, and her teacher suggested she publish her work. Alice's husband was very helpful in editing her book. She thinks that they make a good team because they have different writing styles.<|eot_id|>"

Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, two famous triathletes, took part in a special race to raise money for charity. They were racing against each other and against a car. Jonny drove the car on the roads, while Alistair rode a mountain bike across the countryside.

""I'm excited,"" said Jonny. ""I've never done anything like this before. The roads are beautiful, but it's cold today, so I'll stay warm in the car.""

Alistair was also excited. ""I've seen Jonny drive before, so I'm not sure he'll make it,"" he said. ""I might stop for a cup of tea halfway.""

The race started at a lake in the Yorkshire Dales and finished at a high road. The car had an easy time, but Alistair had a tough start with a big hill. He had to carry his bike up the hill and over fences.

Jonny had a problem too. A tractor blocked the road, and he had to wait. ""Welcome to Yorkshire!"" he joked.

Alistair was struggling with the hill, but he didn't give up. He finally reached the top and started to ride fast. Jonny was still driving, but he had to slow down because of the narrow roads.

Neither brother knew how close the other was. Jonny sped to the finish line, but Alistair was close behind. He stopped his bike and looked around, then raised his arms in victory.

When I play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, I notice the silence. I bounce the ball on the soft grass, and it makes no sound. I serve, hit the ball, and hear only my own shot. The quiet atmosphere helps me focus. I want to shut out everything except the game and the point I'm playing.

The silence is broken only by the applause and cheers when a point is over. I hear them, but it's like they're coming from far away. I don't think about the 15,000 people watching or the millions watching around the world. I'm too focused.

I've always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My coach, my uncle Toni, told me it was the biggest tournament. When I was 14, I thought about playing here and winning. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Roger Federer twice. The first time, I was happy to have made it so far. The second time, I was devastated. I knew I could have done better. I was so upset that I cried for half an hour in the dressing room.

My coach, Toni, is usually hard on me. He told me not to cry and that there would be more chances. I was worried that this might be my last chance to win Wimbledon. I know that professional athletes don't have a long time to play, and I want to make the most of it. Some moments are more important than others, and I had let a big one slip away.

But Toni was right. I got another chance in 2008. I was more confident that I had learned from my mistakes and would not let my head get in the way. I knew I would win. The night before the final, we didn't talk about the match at dinner. I was already thinking about it in my head, and I wanted to keep that to myself until the game started.

Jane Goodall is a famous English woman who spent most of her life in Africa. She was very passionate about animals and the environment. In 1957, she wrote to her family that she had finally found the Africa she had always dreamed of. She became a scientist, journalist, and activist, and is now considered one of the most important scientists of the 20th century.

Jane Goodall is known for her research on chimpanzees. She spent 40 years studying them in the wild and discovered many new things about them. Before her research, people didn't know that chimpanzees ate meat, used tools, or had emotions like humans do. Her work showed that chimpanzees are intelligent and social animals, just like humans.

Jane Goodall's book about her research, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"", is considered the most important book on the subject. Her work has changed the way scientists study animals and how people think about themselves. Even as a child, Jane was curious and liked to learn. When she was five years old, she went into a henhouse to find out how hens lay eggs. This might have been the start of her interest in biology.

She has done voiceovers for many things, including cartoons, educational videos, and even vacuum cleaner adverts. She says it's not just about doing funny voices, but also about bringing the script to life for the audience.

Shirley started her career by taking a drama course and singing jingles for TV adverts. She then got a chance to do a voiceover for a cartoon and realized she was good at it. She has been doing voiceovers for many years and has worked with many big companies.

Shirley has to be very good at creating different voices and sounds. She even collects new voices by watching children's TV. She says that the key to doing a good job is to smile while you're talking, which makes your voice sound happy and cheerful.

It's very competitive to get work as a voiceover artist, so Shirley thinks it's important to have a good showreel, which is a recording that shows what you can do. She also recommends attending special workshops to learn more about voiceovers and to practice your skills. Shirley loves her job and is very passionate about voices.

Many people ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a dream job that not many people achieve. Most people grow up and choose more realistic careers, like being a lawyer or engineer. But some people do become cartoonists. I studied graphic design in college and then started drawing cartoons for a newspaper. It was a lucky break, but you don't need a university degree or a lot of money to become a cartoonist. You just need to be creative and have a passion for drawing.

To be a successful cartoonist, you need to be good at many things. You need to be able to draw, but you also need to be able to write and think creatively. You need to be curious and interested in the world around you. And you need to be good at business and marketing. In the past, many cartoonists had regular jobs drawing cartoons for newspapers and magazines. But now, most cartoonists have to work for themselves and sell their own work.

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and getting rid of old things. I threw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. I didn't think about it much until a few months ago, when I got an email from a guitar expert named Keith. He said he had found my old guitar and wanted to sell it back to me. I was surprised and happy to get it back. 

When I was a teenager, my parents wanted me to learn classical guitar, but I didn't like it. I switched to electric guitar and played simple songs. I didn't practice much, so I didn't get better. 

I took my guitar out of the box and remembered the day my parents gave it to me for my birthday. It felt smooth and heavy, and my fingers knew where to go. I started playing again, and it felt like I never stopped. The electric guitar is not meant to be played alone, so I might start a band with my son, who is learning to play the saxophone. Or maybe other people who have had a similar experience like mine can join us. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a B1 learner:

There has been a lot of talk about sleep lately. When I wrote a book about people who can't sleep, I felt like I was warning people about the dangers of not sleeping enough. Sleep is very important for our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important it is.

Recently, people have been talking about sleep a lot. But what about dreams? We're losing our dreams because we wake up too early and cut off the last hour or two of sleep. Our most vivid and memorable dreams happen when we're in a special stage of sleep called REM. When we don't get enough REM sleep, our brains make up for it the next night.

Some scientists think dreams are important. They used to think that dreams helped us understand our minds, but now they think they might be more important for our physical health. A scientist from Harvard University says that there is not much agreement among dream researchers about what dreams are for.

A study found that people who are creative, like actors and writers, have better memories of their dreams. This makes sense because creative people need to think in new and interesting ways. But everyone needs to think creatively, not just artists. We need to be able to think creatively to solve problems and make good decisions.

Dreams can help us come up with new ideas and find new connections between things. Even if we can't remember our dreams, they can still help us think more clearly. I know that when I wake up from a good dream, I can write more easily and quickly. I'm not sure how it works, but it does.

We all need to be able to think creatively and solve problems. That's why we need to dream.<|eot_id|>"

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small town by the sea in southwest England. Her studio has a beautiful view of the sea. You'll notice empty frames on the walls, but there are also happy photos of her two daughters. Susie is a famous artist who copies famous paintings. She can make them look just like the originals. People think her copies are the real thing.

Susie has been doing this for 30 years. She has copied many famous paintings, including ones by Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that art experts think they are the originals. Susie's clients are galleries and collectors. Some collectors buy her copies because they love art, but others do it to show off.

Some famous people even buy her copies and pretend they are the originals. Susie doesn't mind. She just wants to make sure her copies are perfect. She believes that if she doesn't do it well, she would be cheating the original artist.

Susie didn't always copy paintings. After she finished art school, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She had to be very accurate and make sure everything was correct. This helped her become a good copyist. She also learned to draw and paint well.

Now, Susie specializes in copying French impressionist paintings. She loves the work of Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. She thinks people assume that modern art is easy to copy, but it's not. The impressionists were very good at what they did, and it's hard to copy them well.

You might wonder why Susie doesn't create her own art. She says she's a perfectionist and likes to focus on copying famous paintings. She has tried to create her own art, but it wasn't as good as her copies. Maybe it's because she's used to making perfect copies, and it's hard to be creative after a lifetime of doing something so well.

Ellen MacArthur loved the sea and racing on it. She was obsessed with being the fastest person on the water from a young age. She had a special connection with the boats that took her on long trips around the world. When she was on land, she felt like everyone was asking too many questions about her racing, and she just wanted to get back out on the water to test herself against nature.

After she finished the Vendée Globe race, a solo trip around the world, she took me on a tour of her boat, Kingfisher. She showed me how she planned everything carefully, even the smallest things like kitchen paper and food. She was very proud of her boat and how she took care of it because it was her home and her life depended on it.

Ellen sees the world like a boat - a small, beautiful thing that needs to be taken care of. She had an important moment when she visited a desolate island in the south Atlantic and saw abandoned whaling stations. It made her realize how we take things and then move on, without thinking about the consequences.

Ellen thinks we need to take action now to save the planet. She says we can't keep using up all the non-renewable resources we have. At first, she thought people should use less, but then she realized there's another way - we can reuse things. She's been visiting factories, mines, and power stations, talking to governments and businesses about this.

Ellen is not an expert, but she's like a sponge, soaking up information. She started a charity, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, to help young people think about and design a sustainable future.

Here is the simplified text for a B1 level learner:

Jordan Romero is a 13-year-old boy who wants to climb Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. If he succeeds, he will be the youngest person to do so. Jordan's parents, Paul and Karen, are supporting him. They are a team, and their goal is not just to climb Everest but also to climb the highest mountains on each continent. Jordan has already climbed five of these mountains and might finish them all before he is 16.

Some experienced climbers think it's not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest. They say that a young climber might not be emotionally strong enough for the challenge. Jordan's parents have heard these concerns before, but they are confident that their experience as climbers will help them make the right decisions. They also think that Jordan is becoming stronger and more responsible every day.

Jordan's motivation for climbing Everest is to inspire other young people to get outside and be active. He wants to show them that it's possible to achieve big things if you work hard. Jordan's parents are not trying to make him famous; they just want to support him in his goals.

Jordan has to balance his love of adventure with the pressure to make his climb famous. He needs to blog, take photos, and give interviews to get people's attention. But his parents will stop the project if Jordan loses interest or decides he wants to do something else, like play basketball.

Note: I removed some complex vocabulary, simplified sentence structures, and reduced the number of clauses to make the text easier to understand for a B1 level learner.

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

Do you know who Brahms was? Most people don't. I'm studying music, but my friends and I don't know much about classical music. In fact, many people don't own classical music recordings. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events. The average classical recording sells only 300 copies. This is a big problem for people who love classical music.

Why don't people like classical music? One reason is that it's not easy to listen to. Classical music has many changes in mood and pace, which can be confusing for some people. We like fast-paced music and fast-paced activities. Classical music requires attention and concentration, which can be difficult for some people.

Pop music is simpler and easier to listen to. It's also about everyday life, which is more relatable to teenagers. Classical music is often about complex stories and doesn't have lyrics. The way we listen to music has also changed. In the past, families would play music together at home, and it was valued. Nowadays, we can find any music online, but classical music is not often part of our daily lives.

Some people think that classical music is more popular among older people, but I don't know why. I play classical music in an orchestra, but I don't love it. I enjoy many types of music. Some teenagers do like classical music, but they are a minority. They like it when they perform, but not as a hobby.

The text has been simplified by:

* Reducing the number of complex sentences and using shorter sentences instead
* Using simpler vocabulary and phrases
* Removing technical musical terms and replacing them with more accessible language
* Focusing on the main ideas and removing unnecessary details
* Changing the tone to be more conversational and relatable to a B1 learner.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother's car and looked at Almonside School. She was a little upset because she didn't want to be there. Her mother was getting out of the car too, but Bonnie didn't care if she heard her. Bonnie's mother knew how she felt.

Mrs. Wyndham looked around and saw that the school was a bit strange, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hill. She saw signs that said 'Science block', 'gymnasium', and 'riding centre'. Bonnie saw the 'riding centre' sign and got interested. Her mother said, 'Let's go this way.'

Bonnie followed her mother to the headmaster's office. Her mother talked to the headmaster while Bonnie waited outside. Bonnie didn't like waiting, so she decided to go to the riding centre. She saw a nice old building where the horses were kept and a big indoor riding area. There were no people around, but Bonnie liked the horses. She treated them with respect.

Bonnie looked at each horse and liked them all. But then she saw a special horse, a brown one with a little white. She liked him a lot. She said, 'I think we've met before, in my dreams. We were winning a big competition together.' The horse's name was Maverick. Bonnie couldn't resist the urge to ride him. She found a saddle and bridle and put them on Maverick. When she rode him outside, she felt like a queen. She laughed and said, 'You're the best horse I've ever ridden, Maverick. I think we could be great friends.' She rode him around the paddock and felt happy and free.

Note: I changed some sentence structures and vocabulary to make it more accessible to a B1 learner, while keeping the original content and tone of the passage.

I've met Cody Simpson before and I'm impressed by his calm confidence. He's a 15-year-old Australian who has already released many successful songs. So, how did a laid-back surfer guy end up performing in front of thousands of fans? Cody started playing the guitar when he was six and writing songs when he was seven. But he was also a good swimmer and loved surfing. At 13, he was in high school and posting videos online. These videos became very popular, and record labels started contacting him. Cody had to make a difficult choice: continue swimming in Australia or move to the US to pursue his music career. He decided to take the risk and move to the US with his family. It was hard for him, especially at such a young age, to choose his career. He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was leaving. Cody is a modest person and thinks it's important to stay humble in the music industry. He packed his bags and moved to the US, giving up one dream to pursue another. Although his family is not in the spotlight, they are always there for him. Cody knows that having a close circle of friends and family is important to stay grounded. Sometimes he worries about the impact his decision has on his younger brother and sister, but his family reassures him that they are there to support him. To be successful, you need to be brave and take risks. Cody's success happened quickly and unexpectedly, and now he's performing in front of thousands of fans in countries he never thought he'd visit. But he knows it won't last forever.<|eot_id|>"

I got out of bed, opened the curtain, and looked out the window. The river was frozen, but there was a small crack in the ice. I could see the wall of sandbags along the riverbank, which was there to protect the town from flooding. I had helped build those sandbags with the rest of the town's adults last week. My back still hurt from lifting them.

As I got dressed, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. He was trying to balance on a piece of ice near the factory's warm water outlet. I put on my kayaking suit and grabbed my life jacket. I checked my pocket for a special chain that my famous grandfather gave me. It's a reminder of his adventures in South America. I also have his old diary, which I keep under my pillow and read before bed.

I went to the kitchen to grab a banana and say good morning to my mom. She smiled and reminded me to be careful on the river. I headed downstairs and almost bumped into my grandfather in the hallway. He was grumpy and asked me where I was going. I told him I was going kayaking. He shouted at me to be more careful and asked what the point of training was, since I didn't win the competition. I took a deep breath and ignored him.

My mom came out of the kitchen and smiled sympathetically. She told me not to mind my grandfather's mood. I smiled back and said I would try to go easy on him. My grandfather used to be my hero, but he's been acting strange lately. I still want to be devoted to him, even though he's not always nice to me.

Mum grabbed Jess's arm. ""Come with me,"" she said. Jess followed her to the study. There was a painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa's, but it was different from anything he had done before. ""Do you know anything about this?"" Mum asked. Jess shook her head. ""I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything."" Jess looked at the painting. There was a river in the picture, but it wasn't a real river. It was a fantasy river. The painting was strange and beautiful in a weird way. The riverbank was very small and green, but it was hard to notice because the eye was drawn to the water. There were no animals, birds, or people in the picture. It felt right that way. Jess was fascinated by the painting, thinking about autumn coming after a long, warm summer. Mum said, ""It has a name."" There was something in her voice that made Jess feel something was wrong. Grandpa never gave his paintings names. He just painted them and left others to figure out what they meant. Mum turned the painting over and showed Jess the words Grandpa had written. Jess read them out loud: ""River Boy."" The words seemed important, but Jess didn't know why. And there was a mystery. ""There is no boy,"" Jess said. ""Exactly,"" Mum said. ""It's strange that Grandpa would be so specific. Maybe he'll add the boy later. I made the mistake of asking him about it."" ""Mum, you should have known better,"" Jess said. ""I know, but I couldn't help it. The painting is unusual, especially with a name. I thought maybe you could tell me something about it, since you seem to inspire him."" ""Inspire him?"" ""Someone who helps an artist create,"" Mum explained. Jess knew what the word meant. Grandpa often used it when she watched him paint, but he never meant she was his muse.

When I woke up this morning, I didn't mean to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I didn't plan to do it on purpose, but it might have been an accident. For example, I could have tripped over the bed with my dad's knife in my hand and accidentally cut the carpet. I'm not saying it happened, but it could have. I just didn't mean to damage the carpet. I wasn't thinking about cutting a hole when I woke up. I was trying to find a way to fit my small cabinet into a corner. My grandmother gave me the cabinet when she moved into a flat. It's a cute, small cabinet with pink and blue flowers and tiny glass doors. I keep my collection of shells and stones in it. My grandmother knew I loved the cabinet, and I was very happy when she gave it to me. The problem is that the cabinet is shaped like a triangle and needs to stand in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom, so I had to think of a solution. I tried to fit the cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was too tall. I thought about cutting a small piece off the bottom of the cabinet, but then I had another idea. I could cut a hole in the carpet to make room for the cabinet. It seemed like a good idea at the time, but now I'm not so sure. Sometimes I do things without thinking, and then I regret it. My dad would probably be proud of me for thinking outside the box, but I'm not sure if he would be happy about the hole in the carpet.

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

""The book 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live in the walls and floors of a house. They take things from the normal-sized people who live there. When I was asked to make a TV version of the book, I knew it would be hard to please everyone. People who love the book have strong ideas about how it should be made. I used the original drawings from the book to make sure I got it right. The author wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' point of view, not from a human's. This made filming more complicated. The main problem was getting the size right. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so we had to film them from far away. When filming the human surroundings, we had to get down low to the ground. We developed a special technique to make the shadows look right. After the series was finished, a famous director, George Lucas, asked me how I did it. We built a special set for the Borrowers' home under the floorboards. The actors had to carry big objects, like giant scissors, and it was funny. We had to stop filming sometimes because the crew was laughing too much. In one scene, the Borrowers get swept down a drain. The actors said it was scary and they didn't have to act much. I wanted the costumes to be right, so I made them heavy and stiff, like doll clothes. This made it hard for the actors to move. They couldn't sit down or take off their clothes. The weather was hot during filming, and the actors didn't thank me for the costumes! We had to film most of the scenes with the actors separated from their surroundings. We used a blue screen and drew pictures of each scene to show the actors what to do. It was a lot of work, but it was worth it in the end. I think the series was successful in capturing the magic of the books.""<|eot_id|>"

I tell Mom everything will be okay. She gives me a kiss and leaves me to start my new school. This is what I wanted - a chance to leave my old life and tour tutors behind. My band is recording an album nearby, but we're staying in this town for good. I want to meet normal kids, not just people who know my dad.

I go to the school office and ask for my schedule. The secretary is not very friendly. She looks confused when I tell her my name is Desert McGraw. She types my name into the computer and gives me my schedule. I see that I have English Literature first period. I like English, so that's good.

Being a teenager in the US is not easy. They are expected to do many things well. They must be good at school, have a part-time job, volunteer, and have a social life. Teenagers can't just blend in and be average. They must be good at everything.

Many people think that teenagers are lazy and don't care about their work. But this is not true. Teenagers have a lot of responsibilities. They have homework, tests, and extra activities, and they also have to help at home and have a social life. 

Some people think that teenagers spend all their time watching TV and playing with their phones. But this is not true. Teenagers use their phones to help them with their work and to stay in touch with their friends and family.

Teenagers have a lot of work to do. They often start their day early and finish late at night. They may not get enough sleep and may even fall asleep in school. 

Despite all their responsibilities, many teenagers are kind and want to help others. They volunteer and do other things to make a positive impact in their community.

In the future, people will probably still have wrong ideas about teenagers. But teenagers will continue to prove them wrong and make a difference in the world.

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers from Bishop, a town surrounded by wilderness in the US. They have launched over 50 balloons to space, 35 km above the Earth's surface. The project is a combination of science and adventure. I joined them for a weekend in the spring to help them launch a high-altitude balloon to record shooting stars.

Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal enters the Earth's atmosphere and produces a trail of light. The balloon has a special box attached to it with a camera, a device to measure altitude, and a thermometer to measure temperature changes. Two GPS trackers help them find the balloon later. The balloon is inflated with a special gas tank, which is donated by someone in a neighboring state.

When it's time to launch, the group counts down and the balloon starts to rise. They track its path with flashlights until it disappears into the night. After the launch, most students go home, but a few stay to watch the shooting stars. They lie on blankets and look at the incredibly clear sky, which is hard to believe is just four hours from a big city like Los Angeles.

The balloon rises higher and higher until it pops in a big explosion. A parachute helps the equipment inside the box land safely back on Earth. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. It's not always easy to get the box back, but that's part of the fun. The group has only lost two boxes in 53 launches.

The group's leader says that the journey is part of the adventure, and they've become more familiar with the landscape. On this occasion, the box landed 84 km west of Bishop, and it took them 11 hours to find it. It was in a canyon, high on a flat rock, near a waterfall. Unfortunately, the camera didn't record any shooting stars, but it was a great opportunity to talk about the effects of atmospheric waves. It's also a great story to tell.

Chloe Morgan didn't like science or palaeontology when she was younger. She only started to get interested in it when she was 15 years old. She was helping her younger brother with a school project and read an article about recent discoveries in the field. This really fascinated her and she decided to learn more.

Chloe remembers meeting a professional palaeontologist named Matt Cornelius when she was still young. She was nervous, but he was kind and patient with her questions. This made her feel more at ease.

I asked Chloe about how palaeontologists are often portrayed in movies and TV shows. She said that some films, like Jurassic Park, have made people more interested in dinosaurs, but they often show palaeontologists as weird or unlikable. She thinks this is not accurate and that real palaeontologists are normal people who do many different tasks, like digging up fossils and writing reports.

Chloe explained that her job is varied and includes both fieldwork and laboratory work. She also spends time explaining science to the public, which she enjoys. She thinks it's important to help people understand science and to show them how it can be interesting and fun.

Chloe was involved in a recent TV documentary about dinosaurs called Walking with Dinosaurs. She was happy to help the producers make sure that the dinosaurs were accurate and that the show was educational.

Chloe thinks that dinosaurs are still fascinating because they remind us of the unknown and the excitement of discovery. She believes that palaeontology is a way to travel back in time and learn about the past.<|eot_id|>"

When you go on a car trip with your family, you know you're not there yet, even if you ask 'Are we there yet?' many times. And when you finally arrive, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here'. So, you should ask 'Are we here yet?' instead. Parents get tired of answering this question over and over during long car trips. They wish they could relax and enjoy the journey. 

Imagine being in the back seat, watching movies, listening to music, or doing puzzles while looking at the beautiful views outside. The parents will take care of everything, like giving you snacks and drinks. But sometimes, something unexpected happens, like my brother putting his foot on my side of the seat. This can start a fight, and the parents have to intervene. 

After a while, everything calms down again, and we continue the journey. Sometimes, I try to read a book, but then I feel a cold breeze on my arm. I look around, and my brother is blowing on me on purpose! He's not touching me, but it's still annoying. This makes me angry, and we have another argument. 

Our dad has learned some tricks to keep us quiet during the trip. For example, he says, 'We're there!' even when we're still on the highway. This works for a while, but you know you're really 'there' when the grown-ups get out of the car and go away from us kids. So, remember: if your parents are still near, the answer is no, you're not there yet.

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford where people can play board games and have a cup of coffee. They want people to enjoy the experience so much that they will come back again. Zuzi explains why they started this business: 'We wanted to bring people together again. Everyone is busy with their phones and gadgets. We wanted to make it a place where people can talk to each other face-to-face.' The games they play are called 'Eurogames'. They are games that are easy to understand and have fun themes like building farms or landscapes. The first game of this type was 'The Settlers of Catan', where players build settlements and trade with each other. This game was created by a German designer named Klaus Teuber.

Later, 'co-operative' games were invented, where players work together as a team. This type of game encourages people to talk to each other and work together. One popular co-operative game is 'Pandemic', where players work together to solve global problems. The game was created by Matt Leacock, an American game designer. He was inspired by another game called 'Lord of the Rings', which is based on a book.

Matt Leacock has been playing board games since he was a child. He used to get frustrated with games because they were too complicated or boring. So, he started designing his own games with the help of his uncle. His game 'Pandemic' was very successful and has been followed by other games.

The growth of video games has actually helped the popularity of board games. Many people who play video games also enjoy playing board games with their friends and family. The rise of mobile gaming has made it easy for people to play games anywhere, anytime. John and Zuzi's café is a place where people can come together and play games in person.

Jamie's mother was a good singer and taught him how to play the guitar. He grew up listening to music from a local radio station that played songs for older people, which influenced his taste in music.

When Jamie was 12, he had to choose between playing tennis at a high level and pursuing music. He decided to focus on music and spent his lunch breaks at school practicing on the piano. At 17, he left school to try to become a performer. He was part of a duo with a friend, but they didn't share the same passion for music. Jamie's parents gave him a deadline to make it as a musician, and if he didn't succeed, he would have to get a job.

After a few close calls with record labels, Jamie was signed to a music publisher at 19. However, the record labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to split with his friend. Jamie eventually found success behind the scenes, writing songs for other artists. He believes that writing songs that people love is important and that he has a natural ability to do it.

He films himself doing these stunts and puts them on the internet. I met him at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. Many people knew who he was and came to say hello. When I saw him do some of his tricks, I was very impressed. He's very brave and creative.

Tony doesn't like being famous. He prefers to focus on his bike riding rather than talking to people. He says that social media has changed the way people interact with each other, and he's not sure he likes it. However, he's grateful for the opportunity to make a living doing what he loves.

I've learned that there are two important things that help someone become a great athlete: energy and the ability to overcome disappointment. These qualities are more important than natural talent. Tony has these qualities, which is why he's so good at what he does. He's not always perfect and sometimes falls off his bike. But he gets back up and keeps trying until he gets it right.

Some people think Tony is reckless and takes too many risks. But he says they don't understand the sport and the precautions he takes to stay safe.

Television presenter Helen Skelton has done many brave things for charity, like running a long way in the desert and sailing down a big river in a small boat. For her latest challenge, Helen walked on a thin wire 66 metres above the ground between two big towers of a power station. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist tied to a wire above. She used a long stick to help her balance. Helen took lessons from a professional high-wire walker. She already knew some circus skills, but she found that high-wire walking was very different. 'The training was hard,' Helen said. 'I didn't know how strong I would need to be. Every day started with a run up a steep hill, then exercises, and then practice on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall safely onto the wire so that if I fell, I could keep going. It hurt every time I fell, but I had to stay positive. If I was scared and shaking, the wire would shake too!' The day of the challenge was windy, so Helen took deep breaths as she walked along the wire. It took her 15 minutes to walk 150 metres. 'That was the scariest thing I've ever done,' she said after it was over. 'I'm glad it's over!'

To save money, Jeff used to ride an old bike to work and to Amsterdam for holidays. 'That trip opened my eyes,' he says. 'I decided to see the world by bike.'

After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 because of a knee injury, Jeff finally set off in 2006. He traveled for three years, visiting 23 countries on four continents. The best part of the trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. Jeff met other cyclists who could ride up mountains, but he didn't regret his penny farthing. The more he traveled, the more amazed people were by his bike. The worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which made him very sick.

We know a lot about what they do during the day, but we didn't know what they do at night because we didn't have the right equipment. Now we can use the'scope to take clear pictures even on dark nights. This will help us make better decisions about protecting their homes. It's hard work. We work in teams of four, each working six hours a day. We've studied ducks in different places, and I've had to take a boat to some places and write notes about every duck I see. The weather hasn't been good - sometimes it's cold and wet. I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We've only missed one day of work because the snow was too deep. I like the challenge of this job, especially compared to the summer when we'll be in a laboratory looking at our results together. It will be hard to be inside, but it's important to do this work. I wouldn't change it for anything!

Changes made:

* Simplified vocabulary: ""exciting piece of equipment"" became ""new tool"", ""hugely"" became ""fewer and fewer"", ""really clear pictures"" became ""clear pictures"", ""make better decisions about looking after the area where they live"" became ""make better decisions about protecting their homes"", ""hard work"" remained the same, ""special snow vehicles"" remained the same, ""hours in a laboratory"" remained the same.
* Simplified sentence structure: Shortened some sentences and reorganized them to make them easier to understand.
* Removed some complex phrases: ""We've studied ducks in different locations, and I've had to take a boat to some sites and make notes on every duck I see"" became ""We've studied ducks in different places, and I've had to take a boat to some places and write notes about every duck I see"".
* Removed some idiomatic expressions: ""It is very hard work"" became ""It's hard work"", ""I wouldn't change it for anything!"" remained the same.<|eot_id|>"

I have a special job where I get to eat chocolate every day! My job is to make sure that the chocolate we sell is perfect. I taste the chocolate to check its taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the ingredients we use, like nuts and fruit, to choose the best ones for our chocolate. I have a kitchen near my office where I can test and taste the products I make. I like to share my creations with my colleagues and they love it! My kitchen is full of machines and ingredients, and it's a great place to go during the day. My job is never boring because every day is different. Sometimes I work in our laboratory, and sometimes I travel to other countries to buy ingredients. This can be tricky with my young family, but I love the variety. The best part of my job is, of course, the chocolate! Sometimes people ask me if I get tired of eating chocolate, but I've been doing this job for a long time and I still love it. I often eat chocolate at home too, even in the evening!

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Simplified vocabulary: I replaced words like ""high-quality"" with ""perfect"", ""essential part"" with ""check"", and ""raw materials"" with ""ingredients"".

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be a circus performer? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a place where young people can learn circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many different skills, like juggling, throwing and catching, and even flying through the air on the trapeze. Students learn new skills each week and their parents come to watch them. Sophia says that to be a successful circus performer, you need to keep practicing and trying new things. It's also important to be friends with other performers and learn from them. Circus performers need to be fit and train every day to stay strong.

Sophia says that people often think that circus performers might get hurt or only work for a short time each year. But the real challenge is planning for the future. You can only be a performer when you're young, and then you need to think about what you'll do when you're older.

The course also teaches students how to plan a business. Many students who finish the course start their own businesses all over the world. Sophia warns that being a circus performer is not a way to make a lot of money. You might not have a regular salary, and it can be competitive. But it's also a lot of fun!

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Shortened sentences and paragraphs to make them easier to understand
* Used simpler vocabulary, such as ""young people"" instead of ""students"", ""learn"" instead of ""teaching"", and ""friends"" instead of ""performers""

You might not know her name, but you've probably heard her many times. Mariam Hobson is a backing singer. She sings behind the main singer. Some people think backing singers are not good enough to be the main singer. But that's not true. They have to be even better. People like Mariam are the real stars of the music industry!

""I love my job because I never know what I'll be asked to sing when I go to the recording studio,"" Mariam says. ""It could be classical, jazz, or rock music. Sometimes I have to sing funny songs for the radio or TV. I'm often surprised by what the producers ask me to do. Once, I was asked to sing like a fish swimming underwater! But I never argue, I just get on with the job.""

To do my job well, I need to have good musical skills and be able to learn quickly. Sometimes there's no written music to follow. I remember my first time recording music for a movie. It was very complicated because there were eight of us singing different songs, and an orchestra too. I was very nervous because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again. Recording sessions can be long enough already!

One of my favorite jobs is helping songwriters. New songwriters don't always know which kind of music suits a woman's voice best. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to make it better.<|eot_id|>"

Julie Deane started a successful business with her satchels, a type of bag that schoolchildren use. She didn't know much about fashion, but she was sure that people would like her satchels. Before starting her business, she thought about different ideas, like baking cakes or planning parties. But she chose to make satchels because she was convinced that people would want them.

Not everyone agreed with her decision. Some people thought that no one would buy satchels, but Julie was sure that she was right. She worked with her mother, who had never had a job before but had a good business sense. They designed the satchels together, inspired by children's storybooks.

Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her business a lot. She sent satchels to fashion writers and asked them to write about them. They did, and soon more and more people started to buy her satchels. Julie's company started to grow, and she was excited to see which celebrities would choose to carry her satchels.

Julie doesn't spend money on advertising like other companies do. Instead, she uses the internet to get ideas for new designs. This way, her products stay fresh and exciting. There was a time when another company copied her design, so now Julie makes sure that her production team is as good as her own staff.

People who visit her offices say that they feel happy and relaxed there. Julie's team loves working together, and that's what makes her company special. She even has a new factory now, and it's the people who work there who make it a great place.

Vicky Harmiston was a child who loved sports. She had a lot of freedom to choose what she did in her free time. Vicky tried many different sports, but she was especially good at swimming. The coach at her swimming club thought she could be a champion one day. However, the club was far from her home, so it was hard for her to balance her swimming with her schoolwork.

When Vicky's brother Jamie grew older, he bought a special bike and started racing. Vicky thought it looked exciting and decided to try it too. She loved it and soon became a regular cyclist. The track was close to her school, so she could easily attend training sessions after school.

Vicky became very good at track cycling and won many competitions. When she was 28, she decided to stop competing. She was tired of the same old routine and wanted to do something new. Vicky got a job at a charity called CycleZone. The charity helps young people who don't like sports to learn to ride a bike. Vicky says, ""We want to help them believe in themselves and their abilities."" CycleZone is a great charity that brings young people together.

Some people think that when famous people help a charity, it's just to promote themselves. But Vicky thinks that if famous people can help, they should. She says, ""If they can help, why not?""<|eot_id|>"

Ana was shy and nervous when she first sang in front of her school. Her teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to help her feel more confident. Ana enjoyed singing with her classmates and wrote her first song, ""Falling Stars"", for her brother's band. She liked writing songs so much that she took a songwriting course. Ana was the youngest student, but she knew a lot about music already. She wrote a song called ""Something to Say"" because she felt frustrated that the teacher didn't listen to her ideas.

Last year, I went on a fantastic trip to the west coast of Canada with my brother Harry. He's a journalist and wanted to write articles about the trip. I've always wanted to visit this place because our great-grandparents used to live there before moving to Europe. I asked Harry if I could come along, and he finally agreed. Just before we left, there were bad storms in the area, but the forecast said it would be calm when we got there. Harry took care of all the arrangements, so I didn't have to worry.

When we arrived, we joined a group and got into smaller boats. Our guide told us that not many people live along that coast, and we only saw dolphins and birds on our first morning. We could see some islands in the distance, but the fog made it hard to see far. I just enjoyed watching the patterns our boat made in the water.

We stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They were full of colorful fish I had never seen before. It was great to not worry about time and just enjoy the moment. We had lunch and dinner together over campfires. When we went to sleep on the boats, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life.

When it was time to leave, I was sad to go back to my normal life. But I knew I would miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures!

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany. I used to watch his games when I was a kid. You might think that seeing so many games would make me like basketball, but it didn't. I liked talking to my friends about how good my dad was, especially when he won. But I would rather read a book than watch the game.

When I started secondary school, I was already 1.80 meters tall. My sports teacher asked if I wanted to join the basketball team. I didn't think I was good enough, but the teacher believed in me. I was a bit nervous, but it was okay in the end. I practiced every day for four years and did well. When I was 15, I joined a special sports academy in the USA. The coach there trains Olympic basketball players. I worked with him and my English improved quickly.

I was homesick at first, but I got used to my new life. I didn't have much time for friends at home because of all the training, so it wasn't a big change for me. I turned professional at 18 and joined a team that my coach knew. I've never regretted it. I was taller than most players, but I was too light for my height, so I had to work on that. Now I'm happy with my choice.

I made some changes to the original text to make it more suitable for a B1 learner, including:

Seven years ago, I was studying tourism at college. I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my hometown, Chicago. I showed tourists around the city and enjoyed it a lot. It was like seeing my city for the first time again! After finishing my studies, I decided to work as a tour guide full-time. I thought it would be easy, but I had to learn a lot more to get a licence. I had to know many facts about the city, like its history and architecture. I also had to learn how to answer questions about public transport and more. It took a few months, but I got my qualification and became an independent tour guide.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts or keeping track of the group. You need to be entertaining and tell interesting stories. You also need to be able to solve problems, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to have a good time, not hear about problems. I make sure my tours are fun and stress-free, so visitors are happy. If they're not happy, they might write a bad review online. Good reviews help me get more customers, so I try my best to make sure they're happy.<|eot_id|>"

My name is Ella. I'm 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand with my sister Josie. We're not too far apart in age, but we're very different. We went to help at an elephant sanctuary, where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. We were a bit worried because the other volunteers were much older than us. But it turned out that we got along really well. Our main job was to collect food for the elephants. They eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so it took most of the day. Josie found it hard work, but it was worth it to see the elephants happy. We also helped wash the elephants in the river. I had a lot of fun, even though I got wet! The best part of the day was the evening. We took the elephants on a walk in the forest at night, under the moonlight. All the volunteers lived in the same house. Josie and I shared a room, which was a bit small, but we didn't mind. It was hot and humid, especially at night, but we knew that. The food was delicious and didn't have meat, which we both like. After dinner, we talked and played games with the other volunteers and staff. Now that we're back in the UK, Josie doesn't talk about Thailand much. But if someone asks, she says she loved it.

My day starts very early, at 4 a.m. I go to the flower market to buy fresh flowers. It's often cold and dark, but I don't mind. The market is amazing, with flowers from all around the world. It's hard to decide which ones to choose, because there are so many beautiful ones. I like pink flowers, but I also have to think about what my customers want. Sometimes, the flowers we want aren't available. I have to negotiate with the flower sellers to get the best price. It's not always easy, but it's part of the job.

Back at the shop, we look at the orders and put the flowers in vases. Then, we make bunches of flowers and figure out how much they cost. Some customers are surprised at how expensive they are, and I have to ask them to think again about what they want. I like making sure the flowers are nice and worth the money. That's what I like about my job. I wouldn't want to do anything else.

We've started a blog to tell people about our film club and the movies we show. We also put up posters in cafes to advertise our events.

When I was a child, I loved taking pictures. When I turned 15, I thought I wanted to take my hobby to the next level. So, I decided to take one photo every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I was surprised to find that others liked my photos and enjoyed seeing the world through my eyes. I was taking pictures of many different things, but then someone suggested that if my photos had a common theme, my project would be even better. So, I started taking more photos of nature, especially birds and the sky. Most of my photos were black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing. Sometimes I doubted my project and thought about giving up. But I trusted my feelings and became more confident about my style. One day, I showed my project to my art teacher at school. She told me about a national photography competition for young people. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I was very happy when I won first prize!

I was born in Denver, USA. When I was eight years old, my dad took me to a ski resort in the mountains. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. At first, I didn't think about asking him if I could try it, but he loved it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy, and I was able to do it. After that, I fell in love with snowboarding and got better at it. When I was ten, I started competing.

Some people get bored with snowboarding, but I love it more and more as I get older. I enjoy not having a plan and sometimes it works out well, like when I got a perfect score at a local competition. I wasn't sure I would try the jumps until I did them. That made me feel more confident in my abilities.

In the summer, I focus on training and studying when there's no snow. I train every day, but I don't have to stick to a strict diet like I do in the winter. I also get to spend time with my friends. It's a good way to deal with not being able to snowboard as much.

I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I think it's important to have something else I can do in case I don't become a professional snowboarder or get hurt.

Janine Stuart wrote a book called Being Amelia when she was just 13 years old. The book became very popular. Janine based some of the story on her own life. She said that because her family moved around a lot when she was young, she got good at making new friends. This helped her write about the main character, Amelia, who also has to make new friends at school.

Some funny parts of the book are about Amelia's home life, especially her relationship with her older brother. Janine had to use her imagination to write about this because she doesn't have a brother.

Janine started writing the book during the summer holidays when she was feeling bored at home. Her mum had always wanted to be a writer, and her teachers encouraged her to write too. After she finished the book, she sent it to a publishing company and they loved it. A year later, the book was in bookshops.

One reviewer said that even though the book looks happy on the outside, the characters in the story face some tough challenges, which makes it believable. The reviewer also thought that Janine is a better writer than some famous authors, even though she's still very young. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer, but she's happy to share her experiences with others.

My name is Tom, and I'm 15 years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad got a job as the castle's manager because he works for an organization that takes care of old buildings and lets people visit them. He was really happy, but we were a bit worried about what it would be like living on the island. We knew the castle wouldn't be as cozy as our old home, and there wouldn't be a school. But we got used to it quickly. The castle is okay, and our apartment is comfortable. In the summer, lots of people visit the island, and we have parties on the beach. In the winter, we only see the other families who live here, and there aren't many teenagers like me. But the adults are really nice and help each other with things around the island. The biggest change for me was going to school every day by boat. I like the boat rides, especially on calm days, but sometimes I worry about missing the last ferry home. When my friends come to visit, I tell them to hurry up! The views are amazing, especially when the sun sets over the sea. Sometimes it's foggy, but then the sun comes out again, and it's still amazing. We do get bad storms, but I know the castle is strong and has been here for a long time, so I'm not too worried.

I've been to Egypt and South America, but I didn't see my 200th species yet. That's okay, because I've learned that patience is important in birdwatching.

I made a video about my challenge and many people enjoyed it. My teachers asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I was a bit nervous, but I knew what to say and had notes to help me. After the presentation, the teachers said I did well and they enjoyed it. I might do another one next year!

I'm lucky to live in the countryside, where there are many birds to see. I know some people in cities might not think about birdwatching, but there are still plenty of birds to see in green areas. I think birdwatching clubs should encourage more young people to join. Everyone should connect with nature, no matter their age, and it doesn't have to be expensive.

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

I started playing football when I was 7 years old. I loved it and got better at it. My family thought I might get bored and stop playing, but I didn't. I kept playing and even started dreaming of playing professionally. When I was 13, a referee noticed I was good and asked the manager of a professional women's team to watch me play. She liked what she saw and asked me to join her team. I was surprised because I didn't know girls could play in women's teams. But I started training with the team and got much better. Some people didn't think I would be a good player, but my coach believed in me. He let me play in a big match when I was younger than usual. I was nervous, but I scored the winning goal. After that, I scored many more winning goals. Now, I'm going to help run a football tournament for teenagers in my area. The goal is to get them interested in football and show them that they can play for a top team if they work hard. My advice to them will be to be prepared for both good and bad times. I've been lucky and haven't had many bad times, but I know it's important to be ready for anything.

Changes made:

* Simplified vocabulary: e.g., ""I loved it"" instead of ""I was already dreaming of playing football professionally""
* Shortened sentences: e.g., ""I kept playing and even started dreaming of playing professionally"" instead of ""And the opportunity came sooner than I’d hoped. I often played in local tournaments, and one of the referees noticed that I was a promising player, so he asked the manager of a professional women’s club to watch me play.""
* Removed complex phrases: e.g., ""I didn't believe it at first – I had no idea that young girls could join women’s clubs"" becomes ""I was surprised because I didn't know girls could play in women's teams""
* Changed sentence structure: e.g., ""After that, she asked me to join her club"" becomes ""She liked what she saw and asked me to join her team""
* Removed idiomatic expressions: e.g., ""I've never run so hard in my life"" becomes ""I was nervous, but I scored the winning goal""
* Simplified the last paragraph: e.g., ""The aim is to get teenagers interested in football, and to have a chance to chat to other players in my club"" becomes ""The goal is to get them interested in football and show them that they can play for a top team if they work hard""<|eot_id|>"

In the UK and other countries, there has been a big change in higher education. Now, students are encouraged to start doing research early in their studies. This is because research is not just for famous professors or scientists who are making new discoveries. Research is a way for anyone to learn and grow. It's a way to think critically and solve problems.

As a student, you are already doing research every day. You ask questions, find answers, and make connections between what you learn. You might research what to wear, how to cook, or how to fix something. In college, you'll learn to ask even more questions and think critically about what you read and hear.

Some people might think it's not okay to question what they're told, especially if it's from a teacher or an expert. But in higher education, it's encouraged to question and think for yourself. You need to be able to think critically and not just accept what you're told.

Research is important because it helps us build new knowledge and skills. It's not just about repeating what others have said, but about making new discoveries and finding new answers. So, as a student, you'll learn to ask questions, find answers, and think critically. This will help you not only in your studies but also in your future career.

Here is a simplified version of the text for a B1 learner:

Cities have always been important for intellectual life. People have always gathered in cities to discuss ideas and share knowledge. For example, in 18th-century London, people met in coffee shops to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, the famous artist Pablo Picasso would talk about modern art in cafes.

However, city life is not easy. Cities can be overwhelming and stressful. In fact, scientists have discovered that cities can even affect our brains and make us less clever. One reason for this is that cities are often far from nature. Studies have shown that people who can see trees from their hospital windows recover faster. Even just looking at nature can improve our thinking.

This is important because most people now live in cities. Instead of living in the countryside, we are surrounded by concrete and many people. This can affect our mental and physical health. Our brains have to work hard to deal with all the things we see and hear in a city. This can be tiring and make us feel exhausted.

Scientists have discovered that cities can be too full of stimuli, which means our brains have to work hard to focus. This is known as attention restoration theory. In natural settings, our brains don't have to work as hard, so we can relax and feel more focused.

For a long time, people have known that attention is a limited resource. If we focus in the morning, it's harder to focus in the afternoon. Scientists have also found that being in nature can help our brains recover.

Philosophers and landscape architects have been warning about the effects of city life and trying to find ways to bring nature into cities. Parks and green spaces can be very helpful. Even a short walk in a natural place can improve our brain function.

Despite the problems that cities can cause, they are still important for intellectual life. In fact, cities are often where new ideas and innovations come from. This is because cities bring people together and create opportunities for social interaction.

The key is to find a balance between the benefits of city life and the need for nature and relaxation.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

Where is the mind? This might seem like a strange question. We think we know the answer: our minds are inside our heads. But I think we should look beyond our skin and skull. There is a lot of evidence that shows how things, not just our brains, help us think and learn.

In archaeology, we can see how old objects, like stones and tools, played a big role in human evolution and how we developed our minds. So, what's outside our heads might not be outside our minds.

It's easy to understand why people think the mind and brain are the same thing. Scientists study people's brains using special machines, but this can make us forget that we think with things around us too. I'm not saying that our brains don't matter, but I think we should look at how our minds work with the world around us.

I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). It's about how things become a part of us and how we use them to think. For example, when we use a stick, it becomes a part of our body. This helps us understand what our minds are made of and how they change.

A blind person using a stick is a good example. Where does their self begin? The stick is a part of them, and it helps them feel the world. This shows us that our minds are always changing and adapting to new things.

I think our minds are like a project that is always being updated. We use things to learn and discover the world. That's why humans make things, and those things help shape our minds. I call this ""metaplasticity"" - our minds are plastic and change as we use the world around us.

I want to show that things are important for our thinking. MET helps us understand how different objects, from old stones to new smartphones, have helped us think and change who we are.

Here is the simplified text:

Photography has changed the way we see the world and our understanding of it. In the United States, photography became an important part of the country's culture, not just for scientists and artists, but for everyone. Historians say that photography is one of the most significant contributions the US has made to the visual arts.

So, why was photography so popular? One reason was that it was a new technology that matched the growing interest in innovation and progress in the US. It also made it possible to share images of faraway places and events with others, which was exciting and groundbreaking. Another reason was that photography allowed people to take pictures of themselves and their families, which was a way to show off their identity and share their experiences with others.

Photography also became a way for artists to express themselves and tell stories. Photographs can be seen as a way to point out something important, to say ""look at this!"" And because photographs are made by machines, they can be seen as objective records of what was in front of the camera. But at the same time, the person taking the picture can also bring their own perspective to the image.

Photographs can have different meanings depending on the context in which they are seen. For example, a picture of a person might mean something different if it is seen in a newspaper, a magazine, or a gallery. To understand a photograph, we need to consider its purpose and the cultural context in which it was created.

In recent decades, artists have used photography in their work, incorporating it into paintings, sculptures, and other forms of art. Photography has become an essential part of the way we represent the world and ourselves.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a B1 level learner:

William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the study of mental life. This definition is still relevant today. We all have a mental life, and we can understand it by studying our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. However, it's not easy to understand because it's personal and private. We can make judgments about psychology based on our own experiences, but this can be limited.

Psychologists try to find the truth by studying human behavior and using scientific methods. They want to understand why people think, feel, and behave in certain ways. They also want to know how to help people overcome problems and improve their lives.

It's difficult to study the mind directly, so psychologists study behavior instead. They observe people's actions and try to understand what's going on inside their minds. This is like solving a puzzle, where they use clues to figure out the answer.

Psychology is a science that aims to describe, understand, predict, and change the things it studies. It has many practical applications, such as helping children learn to read, designing safer machines, and treating people with emotional problems.

In the past, psychologists used to rely on their own thoughts and feelings to understand the mind. However, this method has limitations. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on observations of other people's behavior rather than their own experiences.

Here is the simplified text, written for a B1 level learner:

In a warehouse in Michigan, USA, there is a special collection of products that didn't sell well. It's called the Museum of Failed Products. The owner, Carol Sherry, thinks each product has a sad story behind it. The most surprising thing is that this museum exists and makes a profit. Many companies don't keep failed products as a reminder of what didn't work.

The museum's owner, Robert McMath, started collecting products in the 1960s. He wanted to have a library of all new products, not just failed ones. But, surprisingly, most of the products he collected were unsuccessful. This is because most products don't sell well.

You might think that companies would keep failed products to learn from their mistakes. But many companies prefer to forget about their failures and focus on their successes. This is because they don't want to admit that they made a mistake. It's like the saying ""most products fail"".

The culture of optimism can also contribute to the existence of the museum. Many people believe that if they think positively, good things will happen. But research shows that this isn't always true. In fact, thinking too much about how well things will go can actually make people less motivated to achieve their goals.

Psychologist Carol Dweck says that our experiences of failure are influenced by our beliefs about ability. Some people think that ability is fixed, while others believe it can be developed through hard work and challenge. People who believe in a fixed ability are more likely to be afraid of failure, while those who believe in incremental ability see failure as an opportunity to learn and grow.

Overall, the Museum of Failed Products is a reminder that even with hard work and determination, not everything will be successful. It's okay to make mistakes and learn from them, and it's important to have a positive attitude, but not to the point of being unrealistic.<|eot_id|>"

Many people think that sports teams do better when they play at home. But is this really true? Some experts have been studying this and they have found some interesting things. They want to know what makes players perform well and how to explain why teams do better at home.

Some people think that playing at home gives teams an advantage because of the fans. The fans cheer and make noise, which can help the team win. But, what if the team plays some of their home games in a different country? Would it still matter to the fans? Some fans might think that their team needs their support to win.

Scientists have been studying this and they have found some surprising things. They found that referees are more likely to make decisions in favor of the home team if they can hear the crowd noise. This is because the referees don't want to make the crowd angry.

Other experts have looked at how teams have done over time. They found that teams used to do much better at home than they do now. This might be because travel is easier now and teams are treated better on the road.

But, despite all these changes, teams still do better at home in some sports. For example, basketball and football teams do well at home, but baseball teams don't. This might be because basketball and football are team sports, where players need to work together. Baseball is a more individual sport, where players play one-on-one.

Some scientists have also looked at the players' hormones. They found that players have higher levels of a hormone called testosterone when they play at home. This might be because players feel more confident and motivated when they play at home.

Overall, there are many reasons why teams do better at home. It's not just because of the fans, but also because of the players and the way they feel when they play at home.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

Gary Player, a famous golfer, once said, 'The more I practise, the luckier I get.' But what did he really mean? He was being ironic and meant that the more he practises, the better he gets. This idea is important in sports and has been discussed by many experts. Some people believe that talent is born, while others think it's acquired through practice. 

A psychologist named Anders Ericsson said that with 10,000 hours of practice, anyone can become an expert in any field. Many books have been written about this idea, saying that practice is more important than talent. However, some experts disagree. They think that it's not just about practice, but also about a person's natural ability.

The author of this book, Epstein, wants to find out what makes some people excel. He thinks that many studies only look at successful people and try to figure out why they're successful. He wants to know if there are other factors that affect people's abilities.

Epstein travels around the world to find answers. He learns about sled dogs in Alaska and how their drive and desire to work can be inherited. This makes him think that maybe our drive and determination can also be influenced by our genes.

The author says that there are two important things: 'hardware' (our natural abilities) and'software' (what we learn and experience). Both are important, but in some cases, our natural abilities can be more important. He also talks about how men and women are separated in sports competitions, which raises questions about why this is the case.

The best questions are often the most obvious ones.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for a B1 learner:

Many children in rich countries feel unhappy and lonely. Jay Griffiths, an author, thinks she knows why. She believes that children are spending too much time indoors, looking at screens, and not enough time playing outside in nature. She thinks this is the main problem. This idea is also supported by other experts who have talked to children about their unhappiness. The children didn't say they wanted more gadgets, but many said they would be happier if they could go outside more often.

Many adults remember their own childhoods fondly, saying they had more freedom to play outside and explore. However, they often forget that they are the ones who are now keeping their own children indoors, worrying about their safety. Griffiths argues that this fear of danger is linked to the toy and gadget industry, which wants to sell products to keep children entertained indoors.

Griffiths also criticizes some modern trends, such as giving children medication to calm them down or making them wear goggles to play. While these ideas might not be common, Griffiths is passionate about her arguments and has some good points. However, she sometimes goes too far and ignores opposing views. She even compares the way we treat children to a form of racism.

Griffiths believes that children should be allowed to be free and take risks. She thinks that they need to experience some danger to learn how to manage it. However, she doesn't explain how to achieve this. Additionally, not all children are adventurous and some might prefer to stay indoors. Maybe the biggest problem is forcing all children to fit into the same mold, whether it's keeping them indoors or pushing them to be adventurous.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

I'm a psychologist who has studied a lot. I'm good at solving problems, but this has nothing to do with my education. Most problems in life can't be solved with formulas or memorized answers. They require common sense, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from playing.

I'm studying how important play is for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they're young. Those that have the most to learn play the most. Children need to learn a lot, so they play a lot when they're allowed to. Play is the natural way for people and animals to learn.

The most important skills children need to learn to live happy and productive lives can't be taught in school. These skills are learned through play. They include being creative, getting along with others, and controlling their emotions. Creativity is important for success. We need people who can think creatively and solve new problems.

Albert Einstein, a famous scientist, said that his school experience almost stopped him from being interested in math and science, but he recovered his interest when he left school. He called his innovative work ""combinatorial play"". He developed his idea of relativity by imagining a scenario and thinking about the consequences.

We can't teach creativity, but we can stop it by making school too focused on what adults think is important, rather than what children are interested in. Even more important than creativity is being able to get along with others and care about them.

Children are born with a strong desire to play with others, and this is how they learn social skills and fairness and morality. Play is voluntary, which means players can always stop if they want to. This makes play the most democratic activity.

Unfortunately, school has become more stressful, with less time for breaks and more homework. Outside of school, adult-directed sports have replaced impromptu games, and adults often intervene instead of letting children solve their own problems. This has been happening gradually, but it's had a big impact.

We need to give children more freedom to play and explore, so they can grow into strong, capable adults.<|eot_id|>"

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to find a job. They think it's a good way to get in touch with potential employers. But social media can also be a trap. A young jobseeker in the US sent a message to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. The executive was not happy with the message and sent a rude reply. This made many people realize that social media can be a dangerous tool for jobhunters who don't know how to use it.

For many young people, social media is a part of their daily life. They use it to talk to friends and family, share pictures and updates. But using social media for work is different. It's not just about sharing funny pictures or updates. It's about being professional and respectful.

Some young people are making mistakes on social media. They are sending messages that are too casual or arrogant. This can make it hard for them to get a job. Employers don't like it when young people are too familiar or seem to think they are entitled to a job.

So, how can young people use social media to find a job? First, they should explain who they are and what they can do for the person they are contacting. They should also be humble and polite. Sending a message that is too casual or arrogant can ruin their chances of getting a job.

Remember, social media can be a great tool for finding a job, but it needs to be used carefully. Young people need to be professional and respectful if they want to make a good impression.<|eot_id|>"

Newspapers are in trouble. Many people think they will soon disappear. Since 2000, the number of people reading newspapers in the UK has gone down by a third to half. In the US, only 26% of people get their news from newspapers, compared to 45% in 2001. Some experts predict that the last newspaper will be gone in 15 years. However, old media have a way of surviving. For example, books, theatre, and cinema have all had to compete with new technologies, but they are still popular.

Newspapers were once new and exciting, but it took a long time for them to become the main way people got their news. This was because it was hard to produce and distribute newspapers quickly and cheaply. People used to think that the world was a stable and predictable place, and they didn't need to know what was happening all the time. But now, we expect things to change and we want to be up-to-date.

The way we get our news is changing. We can now choose what we want to read and when we want to read it. We can also correct mistakes and misunderstandings quickly. Newspapers used to have to fit a lot of information into a small amount of space, which made it hard to tell complex stories. Now, we can share more information and provide more context.

Some people think that newspapers are not doing a good job of explaining how the world works. Maybe they will disappear. Or maybe they will find a new way to help us understand the world and make sense of the chaos around us.

If we were meant to live in the moon's light, we would be happy in the dark. But we're not. Our eyes are adapted to living in the sun's light. This is something we're born with, even if we don't think about it much. We've found ways to make the night brighter by adding artificial light. This is like controlling a river. It has its benefits, but also some negative effects, called light pollution. This is when we shine light upwards into the sky, instead of keeping it on the ground where it's needed. This can affect many living things, including us. Some animals, like birds, migrate at night and can get confused by artificial light. This can even affect how we sleep and feel physically.

In the past, cities were much darker at night. Imagine walking through London at night in the 1800s. There were only a few lights, and you would have smelled the city more than seen it. We've made the night brighter as if it were an empty space, but it's not. Many animals are nocturnal, and light affects them. Some birds are attracted to artificial light and can get trapped. Even humans need darkness to be healthy. Denying ourselves darkness can cause problems. Our bodies need a regular rhythm of day and night to stay healthy.

In the end, we're trapped by light pollution, just like animals near a brightly lit highway. We've cut ourselves off from our natural heritage - the stars and the rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us forget our place in the universe and our connection to the natural world.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a B1 learner:

The boss of a big company recently announced that they will no longer track how many holidays their employees take. This idea came from another company that has already done the same thing. However, the two companies are very different. The smaller company has only 2,000 employees and does one thing, while the big company has 50,000 employees and does many different things.

The idea is that employees can take as much time off as they want, as long as they are sure it won't harm the company. But is this possible? It's hard to be 100% sure that your work is up to date and that your absence won't cause problems. Even if you do everything you can to prepare, there will always be a lot of work to come back to.

This policy might not be good for the company. Employees might not take holidays because they will feel guilty or worried about the work they will miss. They might also feel pressure from colleagues and gossip about who is taking time off. In the past, people have been used to having a certain amount of holiday time, and now they might feel like they have to take less. This could lead to stress and a decrease in productivity.

Modern technology makes it easy to work at any time and in any place, which can make it hard to separate work and leisure time. Some people might feel like they are always working, even when they are on holiday. Employment laws are in place to protect workers' health and well-being. Workers need rest and leisure time to stay healthy and happy. I'm not sure if this policy will really help employees take more holidays or if it will just cause problems.

Journal-based peer review is the process of checking a scientific research paper by experts in the same field. It is supposed to make sure that only good and accurate papers are published. However, some people think that this system has problems. Reviewing a paper can take a long time, and some scientists are not sure if it's worth the wait.

I think that journal-based peer review is important, but I also think that we need to change the way we do things. One way to do this is by using preprints. A preprint is a draft of a paper that is shared online before it is officially published. This allows other scientists to read and comment on the paper quickly, which can help to improve the research.

Some scientists are worried that using preprints could lead to bad science being published. However, this has not happened so far. In fact, preprints can help to make sure that research is shared quickly and widely, which is important for the scientific community.

One advantage of preprints is that they allow scientists to share their work quickly, even if it is not perfect. This can be helpful for sharing negative results, which are often not published in traditional journals. Preprints can also increase the number of times a paper is read and cited, which is important for scientists who want to share their work with others.

Overall, I think that preprints can be a useful way to improve the way we do science. They can help to make sure that research is shared quickly and widely, and they can help to focus attention on the work itself, rather than where it is published.

When I ask my students to define a poem, they usually say it's like a painting with words. But I don't find their answers satisfying. One day, I asked them to write a paragraph about an object, first as a scientist would, and then from the object's point of view. One student chose an oxygen mask and wrote: ""I may look strange, but I help people breathe. I'm only used in emergencies and most people will never need me."" This exercise helped my students understand how poetry is unique.

I used to think poetry was confusing and got in the way of understanding and feeling. But now I think poetry can be useful. When we read a poem, we might look for deep feelings, beautiful images, and clever ideas. But sometimes we can find these things in other forms of art, like films, novels, or music. Poetry is special because it can be ambiguous, like everyday life. We might not always understand a poem, but that's what makes it interesting.

Some people try to define poetry by comparing it to other things, like a machine or a wild animal. But these comparisons don't work. Instead, trying to define poetry can help us think about what we mean by machine or wild animal. Poetry can also be like a song, with words and music working together to create something powerful.

A poem can be surprising and special because it's not like other writing. It's not meant to be sold or used for a specific purpose. A poem is its own reason for being. Because of this, a poem can still surprise us, even if only for a moment.

I bought my first metal detector when I got married. It was a big expense, but my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, I've found many other interesting things, like old brooches and coins. These discoveries make me feel connected to the past. After finding the gold ring, it took 40 years for me to find something else that impressed Marion as much. On a rainy afternoon, I went to a spot I knew had old farming equipment. My detector beeped, and I dug up a piece of a metal wheel. Then, it beeped again. I couldn't ignore it, so I dug deeper. As I brushed away the dirt, I saw a golden ball. It looked like a loop with intricate patterns. I knew what it was - the Great Torc, a famous necklace from ancient Britain, over 2,000 years ago. I took it to the car and couldn't stop staring at it. When I got home, I showed it to Marion, and we both stared in amazement. We didn't try it on because we didn't want to damage it. We kept it in our wardrobe, but I was worried someone might steal it, so I hid it in my office. I had to report it to the authorities, and eventually, I sold it to the council. The money was split between me and the owner of the field. The £350,000 was a big surprise! Some people think I'll stop detecting now, but I love finding new things, just like a fisherman loves catching fish.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a B1 learner:

I love sleeping when I'm traveling. But I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends share their detailed travel plans, I smile and don't say much. They plan their days carefully, with lots of activities like visiting museums and going for hikes. But my travel plans are different. I like to leave some time for sleeping in the afternoon or taking a nap in the morning. It's one of the best things about traveling.

When I went to the Yucatán coast in Mexico, I was surprised to find that I slept a lot. I would sleep for more than 12 hours a day. It was strange, but I didn't mind. I was far from home and my own bed, and everything was new and different. I could sleep deeply and have nice dreams.

When we travel, we open ourselves up to new experiences and sights. We take in new cultures, music, and ways of living. And it's when we sleep that we process all of this new information. That's why sleep is so important when we're traveling.

Sleep is also different from place to place. In some places, people sleep at different times or in different ways. For example, on the island of Trinidad, people wake up early and sleep in the middle of the day. It took me a few days to get used to this new rhythm. When I finally adjusted, I felt like I had really arrived.

I remember a day in Santo Domingo when I had a big lunch with some new friends. We ate a lot and then everyone started to feel tired. We all lay down on the couches and hammocks. It was a nice feeling, and I realized that this was a common thing to do in this culture.

Travel sleep has another good thing: it's something I remember. When I'm in a new place, I sleep and my brain fills up with new sights, sounds, and smells. It's a special part of traveling. Maybe I should stop feeling embarrassed about sleeping a lot and just enjoy it.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text:

Mia, a hat shop owner, was helping a customer choose a hat. The customer didn't like the first one Mia suggested, but Mia thought it would suit her. The customer wanted to stand out at her daughter's wedding, so she chose a small, red and black hat with a bow.

Mia thought about her own daughter, Jen, who was turning 30 today. Mia was looking forward to seeing her and her family, including her husband Jeff and their son Luke. Mia's husband, Jeff, was a straight-talker and didn't like fancy things. He would have told the customer the truth about the hat, even if it wasn't what she wanted to hear.

Mia had converted a barn on her property into a hat shop, which was a success. She sold hats and other accessories, and women came from all around to visit her. Mia's shop was in a small village, and she made sure her customers felt comfortable and relaxed while they shopped.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Removed complex vocabulary and sentence structures
* Shortened sentences to make them easier to understand
* Removed the dialogue between Mia and her husband, Jeff, as it was not essential to the main story
* Simplified the description of the hat shop and Mia's business
* Removed the phrase ""pussyfooting about"" as it is a idiomatic expression that may not be familiar to B1 learners.

Lawrence Okoye has moved from London to Atlanta, USA. He's a talented athlete who has gone from throwing the discus to playing American football. It's a big change, but Lawrence is confident he can make it. He never played American football before, but he's been picked for a big team. He's still learning the rules and his new position.

Lawrence is 21 years old and was a good discus thrower. He was even ranked number four in the world. He came to Atlanta to train for the world championships, but then he decided to try out for the American football team. He had always thought about playing football, but it seemed crazy at first.

Lawrence didn't worry about being nervous at the tryouts, even though he had never played the game before. He just applied online and showed up. He did well in the tests and drills and was chosen for the team. He's not sure what his new position is yet, but he's excited to learn.

Some people think it's strange for someone who has never played football to join a big team. But Lawrence is focused on his goals. He knows he can always go back to throwing the discus if American football doesn't work out. He's just trying to achieve his dreams.

Here is a simplified version of the text for a B1 learner:

I had been flying for a long time and woke up to see that it was already daytime. I looked out the window and saw a vast, empty landscape. It was a beautiful sight, with mountains, streams, and forests stretching to the horizon. My neighbor, Sergei, woke up and smiled at me. He was a salesman from Moscow who was going to sell safety clothes to mining companies in a remote area. His English was not very good, but we managed to communicate using a dictionary. I told him I was going to Magadan, a city in eastern Siberia, with only a one-way ticket. I planned to ride my bicycle back to England. Sergei was surprised and said, 'But there is no road from Magadan. You can't ride a bicycle.' I told him I thought there was a road, even if not many people used it. 'Alone?' he asked. 'No, I'll be with a friend,' I replied. Sergei looked unconvinced, so I showed him my warm clothes and explained that I had bought them cheaply. I didn't mention that I was on a tight budget because my trip was self-funded. 

It all started in a lecture hall in Scotland. I was thinking about a dilemma and decided to write a note to my friend Al. I asked him if he wanted to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China that summer. He agreed, and it was six years later that I was going to join him in Siberia. 

I was a geography teacher, and although I still struggled with my classes, I loved the job. It was challenging, never boring, and I had long holidays to go on adventures. I had gone on two adventures with Al since we started teaching. He had caught the adventure bug after our bike ride in Pakistan and decided to cycle around the world. This was his biggest challenge yet. He sometimes thought the ride would break him, but he was proving the skeptics wrong and feeling alive.

Note: I have kept the main events and ideas of the original text, but simplified the language and sentence structure to make it more accessible to a B1 learner.

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

In the Red Bull Air Race, 12 pilots fly their planes through a course with tall pylons. They do sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at very high speeds. I got to try it out. Before the flight, I had to sign two forms. One said I was healthy, and the other said I would empty my pockets because small things can be dangerous in the air. I also learned to keep my eyes on the horizon and relax when we're upside down.

During the safety briefing, I was told not to touch anything. When we were ready to take off, my legs were shaking because I was worried. The pilot, Dario, and I were in a very fast plane, the Zivko Edge 540. We took off and did a sharp turn to the right. I felt the air go out of my lungs, and I looked up at the horizon. We did some more turns and dives, and I felt like I was going to be sick. We flew very low over the ground, and I was scared.

But then Dario let me fly the plane for a bit. It was very responsive, and I was shaking with excitement. After that, Dario did some more tricks, like a barrel roll and a loop. I was getting a bit scared, but I didn't want to say so. When we landed, Dario had some sandwiches, and I didn't eat for hours. That night, I kept dreaming about the flight and doing loops in my sleep.

I changed the text to make it easier for a B1 learner by:

* Using simpler vocabulary and sentence structures
* Breaking up long sentences into shorter ones
* Removing complex phrases and idioms (e.g., ""the cruel paradox of high-speed acrobatic flying"")
* Simplifying the descriptions of the flight experience to make it more relatable and understandable for a B1 learner

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films animals in cold places. He loves his job and has been doing it for many years. He used to be a marine biologist and commercial diver. He learned about survival in cold places while diving.

Doug got his big break when a TV crew came to Antarctica to film a wildlife documentary. He took the crew to different places and realized that being a wildlife cameraman was the perfect job for him. He gets to travel, have adventures, and work underwater.

When Doug started, not many people had been to Antarctica. He was one of the first to film there. He says it's easier to film now because of the new technology. In the past, he had to remember what shots he needed to take and what he missed. Now, he can take many shots and review them immediately.

Doug is experienced in filming in cold conditions. He has spent a lot of time on sea ice and is comfortable in the cold. He says that filming wildlife is not always easy and can be full of surprises. Sometimes, he makes mistakes and has to deal with difficulties.

Doug recently filmed polar bears in the Arctic. It was a challenging assignment because it was very cold and snowy. He had to walk for hours each day and wait patiently for the bears to appear. Finally, he saw a mother bear and her cub. He was so excited to capture this moment on film.

Doug wants to make a new documentary about climate change in the Arctic. He wants to talk to the people who live there and show how climate change is affecting them. He thinks he could make an amazing documentary if he gets the chance.

Pen Hadow is an explorer who has done many amazing things. In 2004, he became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone and without help. He had to swim through very cold water, fight frostbite, and avoid polar bears. Eight months later, he walked to the South Pole too. Now, he's going back to the Arctic to do an even bigger expedition. This time, he'll be with two friends and they'll walk 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole to measure the thickness and density of the ice. Nobody has done this before, and the results will be very important for scientists.

Pen was trained for this kind of adventure from a young age. His father's old nanny, who used to work with a famous explorer, would send him outside in the cold and wind with hardly any clothes on to make him tough. Pen's love of adventure came from his father, and he grew up to be very strong and able to handle the cold. He's married to Mary, who loves the outdoors too, and they have two children. Mary says Pen is very brave and has a strong spirit.

Pen is a bit worried about being away from his family this time. He made a mistake last time and said something to his son that made him feel too responsible. This time, he wants to stay in touch as little as possible so he can focus on the expedition. He's very careful about his equipment and is making sure everything is perfect before he leaves. He'll be with two other experienced explorers and a team of six people who will bring them supplies.

Pen thinks this expedition is important because it will help scientists understand what's happening to the ice in the Arctic. He believes that explorers like him can make a difference and do something useful for the world.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

I took a year off after being a professional athlete. I did some writing and TV work, and spoke to businesses and schools. But I missed the excitement of competing. To stay in shape, I started doing marathons and triathlons. Then, my friend Ben Fogle asked me to row across the Atlantic with him. I loved rowing and missed the feeling of being on the water. But I wasn't sure if I was ready to train every day. I talked to some rowing friends, but they weren't interested. I thought about the race and decided to join Ben. We had to pay a lot of money for the boat and equipment, £70,000! We needed to work hard to make it happen. As a retired athlete, I make money by speaking at business conferences. But I find it hard to talk about my past achievements without having a new goal. This race would give me a new goal and something to work towards. I learned a lot while preparing for the race. One of the biggest lessons was to appreciate the easy life of a full-time athlete. My training was tough, but it was set and I had help from doctors and dieticians. I was worried about people thinking I just wanted to be on TV, but I was surprised by how much Ben had to learn about rowing. He had done other tough challenges, but rowing was new to him. I could have been more patient, but I had to tell him the truth - he needed to improve a lot. I should have realized that when I agreed to race with him.

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

I left my job in London to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in Finland. I was 26 and felt restless. I wanted to experience the cold and quiet of the Arctic. I found a small company that takes tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies. They needed a new dog handler, so I joined them for three months.

I started packing immediately. On the plane, I looked at a list of over 100 husky names, but I was too nervous to memorize them. Instead, I looked out the window and saw the winter landscape. In Finland, the bus took me through dark forests and we stopped for reindeer to cross the road.

When I arrived at the farm, I was given a pair of boots and told to go outside. It was cold! Anna, my boss, asked if I wanted to start working right away. I followed the sound of barking dogs and saw people harnessing them to sleds. The dogs were excited and pulling hard. I introduced myself, but everyone was busy, so I just stood there and petted one of the dogs.

After a few days, I learned how to drive the sleds. It's easy: lean into the corners, use the brake, and hold the handlebar tight. But other tasks, like feeding and watering the dogs, were harder. The water would freeze in the cold weather, so we had to make a special soup for them.

At the end of my first week, I was tired and my muscles hurt. But I was proud of myself because I learned how to use an axe, hammer a nail, and use a saw in the snow.<|eot_id|>"

Paula Radcliffe finished a marathon in an amazing time. The press were surprised because her time was good enough to qualify her for the men's marathon at the world championships. Reporters asked her about a special treatment she used, emu oil, which was recommended by Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman. Radcliffe had used it to help her heal from an injury she got when she ran into a bike while training.

Radcliffe said that she didn't really think about how amazing her achievement was at the time. She and her team had said they wouldn't set any limits for her, and she just focused on doing her best. Her coach and physiotherapist were with her during the race and were worried that she was going too fast. But Radcliffe was determined to push herself.

In the end, Radcliffe finished the race in under 2 hours and 16 minutes. She was very fast, but she thought she could go even faster. She was already thinking about next year's race and wanted to beat her time again.

People were surprised that Radcliffe, who had an unusual running style, was able to beat the East African runners who are known for their skill and grace. Her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, worked with her for weeks at a time, helping her recover from her training. He said that Radcliffe was the hardest athlete he had ever worked with, and that she would often push him to his limits.

I was surprised when my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released. I wondered if people would like it because it was different from other cooking shows. It wasn't just about cooking techniques, but also about history, nostalgia, and science. I was a bit nervous when the first episode aired, but it was a success. This led to other projects, including a book about my restaurant. In each project, I went on a journey, whether it was into the past, into my own mind, or into the world of cooking.

I wrote several books called 'Perfection', each one accompanying a TV show of the same name. In these books, I traveled to different places to learn about food and cooking. In the latest book, In Search of Total Perfection, I traveled the world to meet people who are passionate about their work, like a man who makes golden pasta that tastes amazing. These people have spent years trying to achieve their idea of perfection.

Perfection is a personal thing, and it's hard to agree on what's perfect. Even choosing which dishes to include in the book was difficult, and I knew I would upset some people by leaving out their favorite dishes. But we managed to come up with a list that everyone could agree on.

In the book, I use my technical skills and scientific knowledge to understand what makes certain dishes work. I also talk to food producers, artisans, and chefs to learn from them. The dictionary defines perfection as being perfect, but also as trying and testing until you get it right. This book is about my journey to find perfection in food, and it's not about claiming that my recipes are the only perfect ones.<|eot_id|>"

We were still far from Marrakech when our van broke down in a field. John got out to look at the engine, but he didn't know what was wrong. He and my mum started laughing. My sister Bea was worried. 'We can't stay here forever,' she said. The field was big and empty, with just grass and flowers. 'We can't stay here forever,' I repeated, because it's always better to agree with Bea.

We got back in the van and waited for John to find someone who could fix the car. Mum lay down on the grass and said, 'Tell us a story.' My sister and I sat down next to her. I told them about the birds I heard talking in London before we left. I told them what they were talking about, like breadcrumbs and the weather. My sister didn't believe me. She said, 'That's stupid, no one understands bird language.' I felt sad.

After a while, John came back with some Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to a nearby hotel. My sister didn't want to get out, but the boys didn't mind. They waved at her through the window. We followed John to the hotel café. It was a nice place with a shady area where we could sit. We had tea made from mint leaves, which was very sweet. My mum said it was like syrup.

We stayed at the café all day while John tried to fix the car. When it started getting dark, John said, 'I think it's a miracle we made it this far.' My mum made a bed for us on the road, and we slept there. The next day, John said we would have to have the van towed to Marrakech. We rode in a truck, watching our van being pulled behind us. My sister didn't want to move at first, but John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she was sitting in the front with the driver.

'My dad says I spend too much time online and I should get out more. But I wanted to know what experts think. Most teenagers who use social media have many friends, a good sense of who they are, and learn important skills. Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says social media is just a part of modern life for teenagers. It's not good or bad - it depends on how we use it.

Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says social media is like a virtual youth club. It helps teenagers make friends, share jokes, and talk about their interests. It's like the way our parents used to hang out at the youth club when they were our age.

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says social media can help us figure out who we are and what we like. We can post about our favorite things and see what others like. Research shows that people who use social media a lot are not as self-centered as those who don't.

Professor Andrew Phillips says social media can be helpful for shy people or those with special interests. They can connect with others who like the same things. Pauline White, an expert on digital education, says social media can be a creative force. Teenagers can make videos, podcasts, and blogs about things they're interested in. They can also share photos and learn from others.

She thinks social media will be important in the workplace. Every business uses social media to sell products and increase brand awareness. Teenagers who use social media creatively will have an advantage when they grow up and start working.'

We packed our bags and set off on our adventure. We drove through the Oklahoma panhandle, where we saw a huge dust storm. We learned that cows have the right of way on the roads! The next day, we drove to the mountains and then to a place called Pagosa Springs in Colorado. The air smelled of sulfur, which was interesting.

We hiked in the sand dunes and visited a town called Four Corners, where we saw a big sign that said ""CLOSED"". We also saw many wind farms and drove through Yellowstone National Park, where we saw bears and had to wait for them to cross the road. We even had a close encounter with a bear!

After a while, we stayed in a hotel with no internet or phone signal. It was old and creaky, but we loved the views. We watched a rainstorm from our window and felt happy.

We went to a ski resort in the US to learn freestyle skiing. Our instructor, Gareth, told us that speed is important, but we should be careful. One of our group, David, went first and tried a big jump. He didn't do well and fell. Gareth reminded us that speed can be unpredictable.

I had never done freestyle skiing before. In the past, I had just enjoyed skiing slowly and making turns. I thought freestyle skiing looked fun, but I was worried that I wouldn't be good at it. When we got to the resort, we practiced on trampolines and ski jumps with artificial snow. We even had foam cubes to land in if we fell.

Gareth told us that the key to freestyle skiing is to control the jump, not let it control you. On the first day, I had trouble controlling my jump and landed on the flat part of the slope. It was scary! But Gareth encouraged us to keep trying.

The next day, we practiced on the trampolines again. I was surprised that I enjoyed bouncing on the trampolines. Gareth taught us some drills to help us learn how to ski jump. I had trouble at first, but eventually I started to get the hang of it.

The ride is very fast and you're screaming. But you knew what you were getting yourself into when you paid to go to the theme park.

It's surprising that amusement parks are so popular. They have many people working behind the scenes to make the rides exciting and safe. These people are engineers and designers who are very good at their jobs. They make sure the rides are fun, but not too scary.

Designing a rollercoaster is a big job. It's not just about making the ride go up and down. It's about making it exciting and safe at the same time. The designers have to think about what the riders will like and how to make the ride feel new and exciting every time.

I talked to three experts who design rollercoasters. They said that the key is to make the ride feel exciting, but not too scary. They have to balance the ups and downs of the ride to make it feel like a thrilling experience. They also have to create a story for the ride, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, to make it feel like a complete experience.

The experts also talked about how they test the rides before they open to the public. They have to make sure the ride is safe and fun. They also have to be a little bit thrill-seekers themselves to understand what riders want.

I asked them if they think rollercoasters will change with new technology, like virtual reality. One of the experts said that while new technology can add to the ride experience, the physical coaster experience will always be the most important part.

Note: I've kept the main ideas and concepts of the original text, but simplified the vocabulary and sentence structures to make it more accessible to a B1 learner. I've also removed some of the more complex technical terms and jargon to make it easier to understand.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

Miranda Ellington is a 25-year-old choreographer who has already worked with many theatres and dance companies. She also still dances sometimes. I'm curious to know why she does both. She says that being a dancer again reminds her of the challenges of being a dancer and how frustrating it can be. As a choreographer, she enjoys teaching young students. They are open to new ideas and willing to take risks. She likes working with students because they are eager to learn and don't have a fixed idea of what they can or can't do.

When Miranda starts working with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. Sometimes she doesn't like the music, but she still creates a good dance routine. If the dancers don't like the music, it can be frustrating, but she has to find a solution. She would like to be able to choose different music, but that's not always possible.

Miranda doesn't like to work with just one theatre or school. She likes to work with different people and adapt her style to fit each place. She believes that this helps her stay creative and not get stuck in a routine.

I ask her about a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. She thinks it's a good portrayal of the hard work and dedication required to be a professional dancer. She says that a great dance production is when everything comes together - the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. She believes that aiming high is important, even if it's not perfect.

I ask her if she sees herself as a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist. She says that people like to put labels on things, but she doesn't like to be limited to one style. She wants to keep exploring and trying new things.

Note: I made some changes to the text to make it more accessible to a B1 learner, including:

* Simplifying sentence structures and vocabulary
* Removing complex metaphors and idioms
* Breaking up long sentences into shorter ones
* Adding transitional phrases to connect ideas
* Removing technical dance terms that might be unfamiliar to a B1 learner<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

A friend asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I said that yes, TV is great, but why stay at home when there's so much to see and experience? This conversation gave me an idea for a film that encourages people to stop watching TV and go out. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, so I used it for my adventure. I fixed some wheels and cables to the sofa and wore old seatbelts as a backpack. I slept on the sofa every night, even on the beach one night. Some friends joined me on the way and helped me pull the sofa along. This was a new kind of adventure for me. It was the longest distance I'd ever walked, and it was on main roads, so I could stop at cafes and rest on the sofa with a coffee. When people asked me about my weekend, I liked telling them about my sofa adventure instead of talking about TV shows. You can see the film on my website.

Changes made:

* Simplified vocabulary and sentence structure to make it easier to understand
* Removed some idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms (e.g. ""get rid of"", ""crazy four-day trip"", ""turn off their television sets"")
* Changed some complex sentences to simpler ones
* Removed some details that are not essential to the main idea of the text
* Added some basic phrases to make the text more readable for a B1 learner (e.g. ""I said that yes"", ""I liked telling them about my sofa adventure"")<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

I read about group swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands and I was excited. I'd never gone on an organized group trip before. My brother was busy, so I thought it would be fun to join a group. When I asked for a single ticket at the port, the man looked surprised. He asked if I was alone, but I told him I'd be with ten others. He still looked puzzled, but he showed me to the boat with a smile.

Before we started, our guides explained that a support boat would be with us the whole time and how we could communicate with it. We did a short swim to divide into groups by speed, and then we did our first big swim of 1.5 kilometers. I was a bit nervous because I'm not used to swimming in the open sea. The waves got bigger and I was swimming at the back of the slow group. I wanted to finish the swim, so I kept going and was happy when I did it on my own. The next days were similar: we'd jump in, swim at a comfortable pace, and stop to look at the beautiful scenery. As the swims got longer, I got faster and felt more proud of myself. I didn't need the support boat as much. I'm already looking forward to going again next year.<|eot_id|>"

""I didn't think being a flight attendant would be easy, but I love my job. I've been to many countries, including the US and Australia. I work with great people, have a lot of free time, and never get bored. It's a fantastic job for someone my age.

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I had to fly alone, and sometimes I'd help the flight attendants serve meals to passengers. That's what I liked most about flying. Later, when I was unhappy with my banking job, I decided to change careers. I applied to become a flight attendant and was accepted. Many people at the interview were young and highly qualified, just like me.

Before the interview, I prepared what to say. I didn't just say I loved to travel (like everyone else!). I talked about my strengths and previous work experience. And I got the job! I would recommend this job to anyone. There are many things that make it great, but the free flights aren't the best part. Most airline staff work very hard, and we're like a big family. Even though we don't see each other often, we're still close. When I'm not working, I don't have to think about work. And if I have difficult passengers (which is rare), I know the flight will soon be over and I'll never see them again!""<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a B1 learner:

At the summer camp where I work, I love seeing the children achieve things they never thought they could do. Most children know how to swim and play table tennis, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children feel scared, but after a little encouragement, they try and all reach the top. This makes them very happy.

Some children miss their home at first, especially the 10- to 13-year-olds. We don't let them use their phones all the time. We tell them they can phone home after lunch, and then later, we say it's too late to call now, try again tomorrow. Most children get used to it in a couple of days, and at the end of their stay, they thank us for a great time.

It's not just the children who feel lonely. Some parents call us all the time to ask about their child, which is not necessary. Their child might be busy playing or doing something else, so we have to ask them to call back later. We also get children who wear expensive new clothes. These children often argue when we ask them to change, but soon they understand why.

Note: I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Shortened sentences and phrases
* Used simpler vocabulary (e.g., ""achieve"" instead of ""succeed"", ""scared"" instead of ""nervous"")
* Removed complex expressions (e.g., ""feel very nervous but after some encouragement they agree to try"")
* Simplified the structure of some sentences
* Removed some details that are not essential to the main message (e.g., the specific times when children can phone home)<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text:

""Rock the Planet, a musical show, opened in London last year. It was a big success in the USA, where it was voted the best musical four times. But it was a bit tricky to do the show with British actors because they have rules about how many performances they can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows, so they needed twice as many actors. Luckily, the director found some very talented actors in the UK. The show is very popular and the theatre is always full. I met an 11-year-old actor named Jamie who plays the guitar. He said it's great that he gets paid to play his expensive guitar. Jamie told me that the young actors are very busy, but they still have time for school lessons. He misses his old school friends, but his parents come to see the show when they can. The show's director found a special deal for schools, and Jamie's whole class came to see the show. They loved it, and Jamie felt proud. When I told Jamie I play guitar too, he lent me his spare guitar and we played a song together. I was impressed by Jamie's skills and wished I could play like him. The young actors are all musicians, but none of them had played in a band before. They found it easy to learn, but the hard part was looking natural on stage. They were so focused that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it's definitely worth seeing.""

I made the following changes:

* Simplified vocabulary and sentence structures to make it easier for a B1 learner to understand
* Removed some of the more complex sentences and phrases
* Added a few simpler sentences to help connect the ideas
* Changed some of the more advanced vocabulary (e.g. ""beautiful and expensive Gibson guitar"" to ""expensive guitar"")
* Removed the reference to the director not being present when the author played the guitar (it's not essential to the text and might be confusing for a B1 learner)<|eot_id|>"
