Here is the simplified text:

Some time ago, a website talked about the risks of sharing your location online. The website said that when you share where you are, you are also telling many people who might not be nice to you. This is a problem because the internet is like a big ocean where many people can see what you write. It's easy to get lost in this ocean and make mistakes.

Before the internet, a group of people called bloggers shared their lives online. They learned that sharing too much can be a problem. They got into trouble, lost friends, and even got famous. They learned that sharing online is not the same as sharing with friends.

One of the first bloggers was a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall. He started sharing his life on the internet in 1994. He shared photos, stories, and even his thoughts. He was very open and honest. But one day, he got into trouble because he shared too much about his love life. He had to take his blog down.

Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, had a similar experience. She wrote about her job and her life on her blog. But someone sent her blog to her boss, and she lost her job. This is called the ""online distribution effect."" It means that what we say online can affect our real lives.

Heather learned a valuable lesson. She stopped blogging for a while, but then started again and focused on her family. Now she is a famous blogger and writes about her family. She learned that it's important to be careful what we share online.

The article is saying that we should be careful what we share online because it can affect our real lives. We should think before we share something online, just like we would think before saying something in person.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A2 learner:

Some scientists were worried about a low-budget movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? The movie showed how much we don't know about the universe. Some scientists were worried because they thought the movie was not accurate. They said it was like a mix of a documentary and a drama. 

At first, I didn't understand why people were so upset. The movie just showed some scientists talking about new discoveries that showed the universe is very strange. But then the movie talked about some amazing discoveries. For example, it said that water can be affected by our thoughts. I had heard about this before, but the movie didn't give enough evidence to prove it. It just showed some pictures of ice crystals that looked nice when someone was happy and ugly when someone was sad.

Many people find this idea amazing and want to believe it's true. But scientists are more careful. They want to see proof before they believe something. The movie didn't have enough proof, so scientists were skeptical.

But the truth is that there are many amazing discoveries being made. Scientists have found that the universe is made of a type of matter we don't understand, and it's being pushed by a mysterious force. They've also found that our brains work in strange ways, and that our perception of the world is not always accurate.

Some scientists are trying to create a theory that explains everything in the universe. This is a big challenge, and it's not easy. The universe is very complex and we can't always understand everything. But many people think the universe is amazing and incredible.

I simplified the text by:

* Using shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A2 learner:

Writing novels is a big job, but writing short stories is fun. Writing novels is like planting a big forest, while writing short stories is like planting a small garden. Both are important and help me grow as a writer. 

I like to switch between writing novels and short stories. After I finish a novel, I want to write some short stories. After I finish a few short stories, I want to write a novel again. I never write short stories while I'm writing a novel, and I never write a novel while I'm writing short stories. It takes time to switch between the two. 

I started writing short stories in 1984. It was hard at first, but I learned a lot and enjoyed it. My readers liked my short stories too. One of my favorite short stories is called 'Breaking Waves'. 

I like writing short stories because they don't take as long to finish. It usually takes me a week to write a good short story. It's like a break from writing a novel, which can take a long time. 

I also like that I can write short stories about anything, even small ideas or images. It's like improvising music. And if my idea doesn't work out, I don't worry. I can try again. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write perfect short stories. 

Writing short stories helps me become a better novelist. It's like a laboratory where I can try new things and learn from my mistakes. Without short stories, writing novels would be even harder. My short stories are like small footprints I've left behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like a map to my heart, and I'm happy to share them with my readers.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Science is a way of understanding the world. It is connected to philosophy and can help us cure diseases. But science can also cause problems. It tries to explain big questions, like where we come from and how the universe began. Scientists have different ideas, and sometimes they disagree. This can lead to new discoveries. Science is always changing, and it's hard to understand everything. 

Some people think that science is not good at explaining the world. But it has helped us a lot. We used to think that we couldn't discover anything new in science, but then we found many new things, like radioactivity and the electron. 

Science is not just about learning new things. It's also about using that knowledge to make our lives better. We have to be careful with science because it can affect our lives and the world. We need to understand what scientists are doing and how it will affect us in the future.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for A2 level learners:

In recent years, big publishers have noticed that people are not buying as many ebooks as they used to. This has made some people wonder if ebooks will replace printed books. One person in the publishing industry even said that the excitement about ebooks might have been too much, and that their company was too confident in the power of ebooks.

Despite the fact that ebooks and printed books can coexist, people still worry about the future of printed books. We tend to think of the relationship between ebooks and printed books as a competition, even though the evidence shows that they can both exist together.

This idea of one medium replacing another is not new. In the past, people thought that radio would replace books, and then movies would replace radio. But in the end, radio and movies became popular and coexisted with books.

We have strong emotional connections to different media, like books, TVs, and computers. When a new technology comes out, it can make us feel like we're losing something important. This is why we often feel nostalgic for things we used to have but no longer have.

For example, when people started using e-readers, they began to appreciate the feel and smell of printed books again. This shows that we can adapt to change, and that we don't have to worry about the end of printed books.

The idea of one medium replacing another is a common narrative that helps us understand and make sense of change. It's a way for us to express our excitement and fear about new technologies and how they might change our lives.<|eot_id|>"

Every day, I used to wake up at 5:30 am, brush my teeth, make coffee, and write about how famous people from the past did their daily tasks. I wanted to find out how they made time for their work, organized their schedules, and stayed creative. By looking at the small details of their daily lives, I hoped to show what kind of people they were and how they became successful.

I believe that knowing what someone eats and how they spend their time can tell us a lot about them. This book is about how famous people did their daily tasks, not just about their work. It's about how they made time for their creative work and how they organized their days.

I struggled with the same problems in my own life. How can I do my best work and still earn a living? Should I focus on one project or do a little bit of everything every day? When I don't have enough time, what should I give up? I don't have all the answers, but I tried to find examples of how other successful people solved these problems.

I wrote this book to show how famous people did their daily tasks and how it affected their work. The title is ""Daily Rituals,"" but I focused on their routines. A routine can be a good way to use your time and energy wisely. It can help you stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed.

I started writing this book because I was stuck on a project and didn't know how to finish it. I was tidying my office and making coffee instead of working. I found some interesting articles about famous people's work habits and decided to collect them all in one place. This book is a bigger and better version of that collection. I tried to keep it short and interesting by using quotes from the people themselves and summarizing what they did. I also want to thank the researchers who helped me with this book.<|eot_id|>"

Howard became interested in being a palaeontologist when he was six years old. His family couldn't go on holiday to Spain because of a rise in interest rates, so they went to the English coast instead. On the beach, Howard found an ammonite, a type of fossil. He knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist and study fossils when he grew up.

Howard studied fossils that were very old, from a long time ago. He didn't like studying big, famous fossils like dinosaurs. He liked studying small, delicate fossils on grey rocks. After finishing his studies, Howard wasn't sure if he would get a job. He applied for a job at a college in London, but he wasn't very hopeful.

At his interview, the professor who was supposed to chair the panel had a fight with his wife and didn't show up. A different professor took his place, who didn't like Howard's boss and didn't want him to get the job. But Howard got the job anyway.

Howard was surprised and grateful, but later found out that the professor had helped him get the job because of a personal reason. Howard was happy to have the job and be able to do the work he loved.

One day, Howard's briefcase was stolen at a train station. He was very upset and had to postpone a lecture. He reported the theft and then went to get a coffee with a colleague. There, he met a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi and learned about a new collection of fossils that needed to be studied. This was a big opportunity for Howard, and he decided to cancel his other plans and go to Nairobi to study the fossils.

Professor Charles Spence loves trying new foods. He even eats ice cream made from bee larvae! He is a professor at Oxford University in the UK. He studies how our senses work together to create the taste of food. This is called ""gastro physics"". He has found many interesting things about how we eat. For example, the person who orders first in a restaurant likes their food the most. And we eat more when we eat with other people.

Professor Spence's lab is not very high-tech. He uses simple things like paper and drawing pins. He works with chefs to make new foods. He also helps big food companies make healthier foods. Some companies are reducing the amount of salt and sugar in their foods. Professor Spence thinks this is a good thing.

He has worked with a famous chef named Heston Blumenthal. They created a dish called ""Sound of the Sea"". Professor Spence has also found that music can affect how we taste food. For example, high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter. He thinks that music and food can be combined in new and interesting ways.

At home, Professor Spence likes to have dinner parties with his family. They try new foods and play with different sounds and lights. He thinks that food and science are very interesting and fun.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Our brains are very busy. We have a lot of information coming at us, and it's hard to know what's important and what's not. We're also doing more things on our own, like booking flights and shopping online. This means we're doing the work of many people, and it's hard to keep up. Our smartphones help us, but they can also distract us.

Many people think they can do many things at once, but this is not really true. Our brains are not good at multitasking. We're actually switching between tasks quickly, and this takes a lot of mental effort. This can make us less efficient and more stressed.

Multitasking can also make us feel like we're getting a lot done, but we're actually not. It can make our brains produce stress hormones and make it hard to think clearly. Our brains are also easily distracted, so we might not focus on what's important.

Trying to do many things at once can also make it hard to make good decisions. We might make small decisions, like answering a text message, and this can use up a lot of mental energy. This can lead to making bad decisions about important things.

Email is a big problem for many people. We feel like we have to answer our emails, but it's hard to do this and get anything else done. We feel overwhelmed by the amount of information coming in.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete into pieces to throw at visitors. Was he being mean? In the US, some bats help other bats find the right way to have their babies. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought animals just did things without thinking or feeling. But now, scientists are studying animal behavior and emotions more closely. They are learning that animals can feel and think like us.

This new knowledge is making people think about whether animals have a sense of right and wrong. A recent experiment with cows showed that those that could open a gate to get food were happier than those that had the gate opened for them. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does this mean for eating beef? Some people think we should stop eating meat because of this. Others think we should just be more careful about how we treat animals.

There are different opinions about this topic. Some people think animals are just like us, but simpler. Others think we should not compare ourselves to animals. The problem is that we don't really know what it's like to be an animal. Can we ever know what it's like to be a bat or a cow? It's a difficult question that might not have a clear answer.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for an A2 level learner:

Critical thinking is a way to understand what we read or hear better. Adrian West, a researcher, says that people believe argument is the way to find the truth. However, with the help of technology, people are now exposed to more information, but it can be hard to think deeply about it. West thinks that this is because we are bombarded with opinions, fashion, and just saying things without proof. He also says that having a lot of information does not mean we know more or make better decisions.

In fact, the amount of information we have is not increasing our knowledge or making us better at making decisions. This is surprising, because we would expect that having more information would help us. However, it seems that the quality of our thinking has not improved.

Some people think that reading is important for critical thinking. Patricia Greenfield, a professor, says that reading helps us think critically because it makes us focus on one thing at a time. She also says that visual media, like video games and TV, can be bad for critical thinking because they do not allow us to think deeply.

James Paul Gee, a professor, says that video games can actually help us learn and think critically. He thinks that games like Sim City and Civilization can teach us decision-making and analytical skills. These games can also help us explore ideas and concepts that might be difficult to understand otherwise.

It is clear that technology is changing the way we think and analyze information. We need to understand how it affects us and find ways to use it to improve our thinking and learning.

Changes made:

* Simplified vocabulary and sentence structures
* Removed complex sentences and phrases

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Matthew Crawford is a writer and a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office, but he didn't like it. He wrote a book about the benefits of working with your hands. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life. He thinks that technology is making it hard for us to focus and be with other people.

He noticed that advertisements start playing on credit card machines even when we're just entering our PIN number. This makes us feel like we're always being watched and distracted. It's hard to think and remember things because we're always being interrupted. We're also less likely to talk to strangers because we're so busy trying to avoid distractions.

Crawford thinks that we're all trying to protect ourselves from being interrupted, so we close ourselves off and don't want to do simple things like talk to others. We're also using technology too much, like video games and apps on our phones. These things make us feel like we're doing what we want, but they're actually controlling us.

Crawford is not the only one who is worried about this. Many people feel like they're constantly distracted and can't focus. There's no scientific proof that our attention span has changed, but it's clear that we're more aware of what we're doing.

Crawford thinks that technology has made it easy for us to be self-centered and not interact with others. He gives the example of a gym where people used to listen to music together, but now everyone listens to their own music on headphones. This has made the gym less social.

Crawford's solution is to have rules about noise and distractions in public spaces and to practice using our skills and judgment to engage with the world. He thinks that this will help us appreciate the real things in life and not just rely on technology.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for an A2 level learner:

Do you know what I do for a living? It's a common question, and people usually answer quickly. But when I say I'm a philosopher, it's harder to explain. People might think I'm trying to be too clever or important. This is not true. Philosophers are just like everyone else, but we think deeply about life and the world.

Philosophers have a bad reputation because they're often seen as people who judge others and love to read books. This is partly because ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle and Socrates said that thinking deeply about life is the most important thing. But this doesn't mean you need to be a bookworm or a genius to be a philosopher.

Philosophy is about looking closely at our daily lives and making sure they are what we want them to be. It's not just about reading books or being a professor. It's about being curious and thinking about the world around us. Philosophers can help people understand themselves and their place in the world.

Unfortunately, many philosophers work in universities and don't share their ideas with the general public. This makes it hard for people to understand what philosophy is really about. But philosophy can be useful for everyone, not just experts. It can help us think about our values and behaviors, and make our lives better.

As an ethicist, I work on questions about what is right and wrong. But philosophy is more than just answering these questions. It's about exploring big ideas and understanding the world. By thinking deeply about our lives, we can discover new things and become better people.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level A2 on the CEFR:

Food and eating are important topics that can bring people together. However, philosophers have not always talked about food in a serious way. They usually use food as a metaphor for something else, like learning. Sometimes, they discuss food, but it's not really about food. 

One famous philosopher, Epicurus, thought that people should enjoy life and avoid pain. He didn't just mean eating and drinking, but all aspects of life. Even though he didn't specifically talk about food, people still associate his name with enjoying good food and drink.

Food is a social and cultural part of our lives. We eat with others and share food from our communities. Food is a big part of who we are and how we connect with each other.

Food critics write about food, but not everyone can be a good food critic. It's not just about tasting food, but also about describing it well. Philosophers think that we should pay more attention to how we perceive taste.

Food can also be beautiful, like a work of art. Some people think that food has become as important as art or music. However, food is eaten and gone, so it's hard to appreciate it like we do with other art forms.

There are many ethical questions about food, like what we should eat and how we should treat animals. Philosophers will always ask questions about these issues.

Cooking at home is different from cooking in a restaurant. At home, we cook for our friends and family, and it's a way to show love and care. In a restaurant, the cooks have to follow rules and work for their employer.

Food can also bring people together from different cultures. We can learn about other cultures by trying their food, and we can make friends by sharing meals together. This is an important part of international diplomacy.

The text about food philosophy is not just about serious ideas, but also about interesting stories and examples that make it fun to read.<|eot_id|>"

Rob Daviau, an American game designer, created a new type of board game called 'legacy' games. He wanted to make games more exciting and challenging. He took an old game called Risk and made it 'legacy'. This means that players' decisions have a permanent impact on the game. They might need to tear up cards or change the board. The game is played over several sessions, and players can see how their choices affect the game.

Daviau worked on a legacy version of another popular game called Pandemic. Players work together to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. Players become sailors and explore the world. To make sure the game is fun and makes sense, game designers test the game with players. They want to see how players make choices and how the game changes over time.

Not many people expected legacy games to be popular. Daviau thought it would be a niche game, but many players loved it. They like that it's different and exciting. One player, Russell Chapman, said it's one of the biggest advances in game design in years. He loves that it's a new way to play games.

Some people were worried that making changes to the game would ruin it, but the game Pandemic Legacy showed that it's okay to make changes. Players like that it's like watching a TV series - they can't wait to see what happens next. The game designer, Rob Daviau, wants to see where others take the idea, but he's also happy to see that people are excited about it.

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A2 learner:

One night, a clever octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at a big aquarium in New Zealand. He crawled across the floor and slipped into a small pipe that led to the ocean. This is a fun story that many people loved to read about online.

We like to imagine that animals are like us, and octopuses are especially interesting because they are very smart. They can do many things that we can't, like opening jars, recognizing faces, and even playing with things. Some people think it's not scientific to think like this, but a scientist named Dr. Frans de Waal says that it's actually the opposite. He thinks that we often don't want to believe that animals are smart like us, and that's not good.

Dr. de Waal looked at many studies about animal intelligence and found that animals are much smarter than we thought. They can think about the past and the future, feel sorry for each other, and even guess what others are thinking. Animals are very clever, and we should give them more credit.

In the past, people thought that animals were very smart and could even be put on trial for crimes. But in the 20th century, some scientists thought that animals were just machines that responded to rewards and punishments. This made people think that animals didn't have feelings or thoughts like humans do.

Luckily, we are starting to learn more about animal intelligence and understand that it's not so different from ours. We can design special tests to see how smart animals are, and they can be very good at things that are important for them. For example, squirrels are great at remembering where they hide their food.

A naturalist named Sy Montgomery wrote a book about octopuses and said that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might ask us to change the color of our skin. We would probably fail, and the octopus would think we're not very smart!

Dr. de Waal is a bit skeptical about Inky's escape, but he knows that stories like this can help people appreciate animal intelligence. He did an experiment with monkeys to see if they can feel jealous. When the monkeys got a treat, they would get upset if they saw their friends getting a better treat. This was an important study, and a short video of it helped people understand the results.

This is just one of the strange things about the human mind.<|eot_id|>"

Robots are becoming more common in many industries. They can do tasks that humans do, but faster and more accurately. Many people think robots will take over most jobs in the next 50 years. However, most people also believe their current jobs will stay the same. But this is unlikely.

Robots are already being used in factories and stores. For example, a robot can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, which would take two human bricklayers a day to do. Another robot, called Tally, helps keep supermarket aisles clean and organized.

Some people think robots will create new jobs for technicians and programmers. Others worry that robots will make it hard for people to work together and build relationships.

Dr. Jing Bing Zhang is an expert on robotics. He says that in the next few years, many companies will have a special person in charge of robotics. He also says that robots will become more intelligent and work together with other robots.

Zhang thinks that people need to learn new skills to work with robots. He says that some jobs will be replaced by robots, but people can learn new skills to do different jobs. He also thinks that robots will become more common in our daily lives, like in our homes.

This change also means we need new rules to keep us safe and private. We need to prepare for the future by learning more about science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) subjects.

Some people love to climb mountains. They ask themselves, ""Why do I want to do this?"" One famous climber, George Mallory, said, ""Because it's there."" This means that sometimes we do things just because we want to, without thinking too much about it.

Climbing is not just about reaching the top of a mountain. It's also about the journey and the fun of it. A writer named Tejada-Flores wrote about different types of climbing and how each one has its own rules. Climbers like to follow these rules to make the experience more enjoyable.

Some people love climbing because it makes them feel free. They enjoy the adventure and the challenge of it. But climbing can also be scary and difficult. Climbers have to be brave and face their fears.

A writer named Joe Fitschen asked, ""Why do people climb?"" He thinks that climbing is natural for humans. We are born to take risks and challenge ourselves. Climbing is a way for us to do this.

Another writer, Brian Treanor, thinks that climbing helps us become better people. It teaches us to be brave, humble, and respectful of nature. Climbing can also help us develop important skills, like problem-solving and teamwork.

Some climbers like to do it on their own, without help from others. They have to be very determined to succeed. This can be a great achievement, but it's not always the best way to climb.

Climbing is also about being in the moment and enjoying the experience. It's like a kind of meditation. Some people even think that climbing is similar to a way of thinking called Zen philosophy.

So, why do people climb? There are many reasons. Some people do it for the adventure, some for the challenge, and some for the sense of freedom.<|eot_id|>"

When I was a child, I thought gardens were always beautiful and peaceful. My grandfather's garden was special. It was near a river and had a slope down to the water. You couldn't see the river, but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds singing in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this. My grandfather's garden was not very big or special, but it was a quiet place where I could escape and be alone.

My father was a quiet person, but he had a sense of humor. He liked to use funny phrases, like ""It's immaterial to me."" He wasn't very ambitious and didn't have a big dream. He became a plumber, but he didn't love his job. At home, he was good at fixing things and making things look nice.

My parents moved to a new house only once, but my mother liked to buy new furniture. One day, a piano arrived, and I was scared of it. My sister took lessons, but I never got to play it. My mother said I wouldn't practice.

Lawrence MacEwen lives on a small island called the Isle of Muck in Scotland. I visit him and his family. The weather is very windy and rainy. MacEwen shows me around his island. He tells me about the other islands nearby. He says, ""That island is Eigg. The one to the west is Rum. It gets a lot more rain than we do.""

We go to move his sheep. MacEwen explains that the island is volcanic and has geese that eat a lot of grass. His family has lived on the island for 3,000 years.

MacEwen's sheepdog, Tie, is not doing a good job. MacEwen tells him to go around the sheep, but Tie goes straight through the middle. MacEwen is not happy.

The island is run by the MacEwen family. Lawrence's wife, Jenny, helps with the farm. Their son, Colin, manages the island cottages. Their daughter, Mary, runs the hotel with her husband, Toby. They like that their boys can play outside and sail boats in the summer.

Life on the island is different. There is no electricity all the time, so we have to use candles and torches at night. There is no mobile phone signal, so we can't use our phones. But we make do.

One day, some musicians come to the island and play music in the tearoom. Everyone enjoys it. In the evening, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. He says her father bought a farm on another island without even looking at it. Jenny had never run a farm before, but she was good at typing.

I eat well on the island, and Mary sends me to get fresh fish from a fisherman. I take it to her at the kitchen door. We eat the fish for dinner. The next day, I have to leave the island, but I'm a bit sad to go.

The video game industry used to be small and hard to get into. Many people thought it was just for young people who liked playing games. But now, it's becoming more important and growing. To get into the industry, you need to be good at making games. You don't need a special degree, but you do need to make games to show that you can do it.

Jim Donelly, a games expert, says that it's hard to get a job at a big company or work on a big game. But the industry needs people who can design games, not just the people who make the big decisions. He says that the best way to get into the industry is to just start making games.

John Field, another expert, agrees that making games is important, but he thinks it's not as easy as just ""doing it"". He says that there are many people who want to work in games, but not many have the skills and talent to do it well. He suggests that taking a postgraduate course in games can help, as well as having good connections and networking.

The video game industry is changing and growing. More people are playing games, including families and adults. Games are not just for fun, but also a way to learn new things. John thinks that there are many opportunities in the industry and that it will continue to grow.

I've always loved playing football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me to. I had a friend who didn't like playing because his dad was too bossy. This made me appreciate playing football even more. When I score a goal, people say it's just luck, but I've worked hard to improve my skills. The best players in the world practice a lot to get good. 

I played many sports at school, but football was my favorite. I want my son to enjoy learning new skills too. We're already reading to him, even though he's too young to sit still. I hope he doesn't become like me and only want to play football.

When I started my professional football career, our manager was kind and didn't make a big deal about it. We knew we had to work hard. We lost our first game, and a TV presenter said we couldn't win anything with young players. But we believed in ourselves and worked together as a team.

I rely on my friends and family. Having a lot of money can be a problem sometimes. People sometimes say I should help my parents more, but I've already helped them by paying off their mortgage and buying them a car. My family is important to me, and I like using my money to make things easier for them. 

After I stop playing football, I want to take a break and do things I haven't had time for before. I want to go skiing, but I can't do that now because I might get hurt and not be able to play football again.

Violet was getting annoyed. She had paid a lot of money for this trip, and she wanted it to be special. She was worried that she had made a mistake.

John Maloof bought a box of old photos at an auction. He didn't know what he was getting. He was looking for pictures to use in a book about a neighborhood in Chicago. Instead, he found 30,000 photos taken by a street photographer named Vivian Maier. She was very good at taking interesting pictures.

John bought many of Vivian's cameras, films, and photos. He also found some movies and audio tapes. He knows he has something special, but he didn't know what it was at first. He could have sold it to someone else.

John and his friend Anthony are trying to learn more about Vivian's life. They talked to people who knew her and looked at the photos. Vivian was born in New York and lived in France as a child. She moved to Chicago in 1956 and worked as a nanny. She always carried a camera with her.

Vivian was a private person, but she loved taking pictures. She took photos of people, streets, and buildings. She was very good at it. Some people think she might have been influenced by other photographers, but she was also very original.

John is still looking through all the photos. He has many files full of them. He didn't know much about photography before he found Vivian's work, but now he loves taking pictures too. He wants to share Vivian's work with the world and make sure she is remembered.

Eleanor Catton wrote a big book called The Luminaries. It's a mystery novel that takes place in New Zealand in the 1860s. A group of 12 men try to solve some crimes. The book is very long, over 800 pages, because the author wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good story.

I met Eleanor Catton in the UK. She was very calm, even though she was famous and people were asking her a lot of questions. She told me a funny story about when she was stopped at the airport and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed them her book and they asked what it was about.

Eleanor said she wanted to write a murder mystery, but it turned out to be much harder than she thought. She wanted to make the book interesting and fun to read. She even made the book's structure special, so that it gets faster and faster as you read it.

Jonny Kinkead has been making guitars for over 40 years. When he was a boy, he loved playing the guitar and building things in his dad's garage. As he grew up, he became very good at making guitars. He learned to play his brother's guitar when he was 11 and later built his own bass guitar. Jonny liked to figure out how things worked and how to make them better. He even made instruments for his friends.

After school, Jonny studied architecture, but he didn't like it. He decided to focus on making guitars instead. It was hard work, but he loved it. He made guitars for a living, but it wasn't easy. He had to work part-time jobs to make ends meet. It took him a while to become well-known and make a good living from his guitars.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Talking about the weather is a common topic in English conversations. Many writers have written about this and mentioned the famous quote by Dr. Johnson that when two English people meet, they usually talk about the weather. This is still true today. Some people try to explain why English people like talking about the weather, but they often get it wrong. They think that English people are interested in the weather itself, but that's not the case.

The American writer Bill Bryson said that the English weather is not exciting, so it's hard to understand why people talk about it so much. Another writer, Jeremy Paxman, disagreed and said that the English weather is actually interesting because it's unpredictable. However, I think they are both missing the point. English people don't really talk about the weather to learn about it or because they find it exciting. Instead, talking about the weather is a way for English people to be friendly and polite. It's like a secret code that helps them start conversations and make small talk.

When English people meet, they often start by talking about the weather. This is a way to break the ice and show they are friendly. They might also talk about the weather when they don't know what else to say. This is because talking about the weather is a safe and easy topic that everyone can join in on. So, even though it might seem like English people talk about the weather all the time, it's actually just a way to be friendly and make conversation.<|eot_id|>"

Two brothers, Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, are famous for doing triathlons. They decided to take part in a special race to raise money for charity. Jonny would drive a car and Alistair would ride a bike. They started at a lake in Yorkshire, England, and had to get to the highest road in the area.

Jonny was excited to be in the car and stay warm. Alistair was also excited, but he was worried about Jonny's driving. The race started, and they went their separate ways. Jonny had to drive on roads, while Alistair rode his bike up hills and across fields.

Jonny had some trouble with a tractor and some narrow roads. Alistair had to get off his bike and carry it up a steep hill. But both brothers kept going. When they finally reached the top of the hill, Alistair was able to ride fast across the open land.

Jonny had to drive slowly through some small villages with narrow roads. When he finally got to the finish line, he was surprised to see that Alistair had beaten him. Alistair was happy and raised his arms in the air. Jonny was disappointed, but he congratulated his brother on his win.

When I play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, I notice the silence. The grass is soft and quiet, and my shots echo through the air. The court is surrounded by history, old buildings, and people dressed in white. The crowd is quiet too. This silence helps me focus on my game.

As I play, I try to shut out everything else and just focus on the match. When a point is over, I hear the applause, but it's like it's coming from far away. I don't think about the 15,000 people watching me or the millions watching on TV. I'm so focused that I don't even think about my opponent, Roger Federer.

I've always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My coach, my uncle Toni, has been with me since I was a child. He told me that Wimbledon is the biggest tournament. I wanted to play there and win. I played in the final two years before, but I lost both times to Federer.

The first time I lost, I was happy just to have made it that far. The second time, I was devastated. I knew I could have done better, but I didn't. I was angry with myself. My coach told me not to cry, that there would be more chances. But I was sure that this was my last chance.

I'm a professional athlete, and my career is short. I want to make the most of it. Every moment counts, and I didn't want to miss my chance. But my coach was right. I got another chance, and here I was again, playing in the final.

Jane Goodall is a famous English woman who spent most of her life in Africa. She is known for her work with chimpanzees. In 1957, she wrote to her family that she had found the Africa she had always dreamed of. She became a scientist, journalist, and activist, and was very good at it.

Jane Goodall is famous because of her work with chimpanzees. She studied them in the wild and wrote books about it. Her work helped us understand chimpanzees better. Before she started studying them, we didn't know much about their behavior. We thought they were just wild animals, but Jane showed us that they are smart, social, and emotional just like us.

Jane Goodall's most important book is called 'The Chimpanzees of Gombe'. It's a big book that tells us everything we know about chimpanzees. Her work helped us understand that chimpanzees are not just wild animals, but are actually very similar to us.

Jane Goodall was always interested in animals. When she was a little girl, she crawled into a henhouse to see how hens lay eggs. This might seem strange, but it shows that she was curious and wanted to learn about the world around her.

Jane Goodall's work has been very important. She helped us understand chimpanzees and how they live. She also helped us understand that we are not the only smart animals on the planet.<|eot_id|>"

""Lots of actors think they can do funny voices, but it's not just about that,"" she says. ""You have to bring the script to life for people who can't see you.""

Shirley started acting in school. She did some singing for TV commercials. Then, she got a chance to do a cartoon and discovered she was good at doing voices. She realized that voiceover work might be for her.

Shirley has learned to create different voices. She watches children's TV to get new ideas. She has worked on many different projects, from educational videos to vacuum cleaner ads. ""It's hard to sound excited about something you don't care about, but my experience helps,"" she says.

To be a successful voice actor, you need to be good at making a showreel, which is a recording of your voices. Shirley says it's important to practice and not give up. She also recommends attending special workshops for voiceover actors.

Many people ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a dream job that many kids have, like being a racing driver. But most people give up on this dream and choose more realistic jobs, like being a lawyer or working in a factory. It's hard to believe that you can make a living by drawing simple doodles, but some people do it. 

I became a cartoonist because I loved drawing as a child. I studied graphic design in college and then showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted my political cartoons. After a few months, I was making enough money to support myself. 

You don't need a lot to become a cartoonist. You don't need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a good artist. You just need your brain, your hands, and something to draw with. But it's not easy. It's a tough job, and you need to be sure that you really want to do it. 

I've done many different types of cartoons, from political cartoons to comic books. I've also written, drawn caricatures, and designed things. I think it's good to learn new skills and be curious about the world. 

Many cartoonists used to have regular jobs, but now most of them have to sell their work themselves. This means you need to be good at selling as well as drawing. I've seen cartoonists with average drawing skills but good business skills do better than those who are very talented but not good at business. 

Some people are worried that someone will steal their ideas, but you can protect your work by putting a 'c' in a circle with your name and date. But it's more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal your cartoon and it becomes popular, it can be a good thing!<|eot_id|>"

Twenty years ago, I threw away my electric guitar. My dad had given it to me for my 16th birthday. I didn't want to get rid of it, but I did. I took it to the dump and was about to throw it away when a young man stopped me. He asked if I was really going to throw it away. I said yes, but then felt sorry for what I did. He took the guitar and gave it to someone else. I was sad about it for a long time.

Years later, I got an email from a man named Keith. He said he had my guitar! He found it and thought it might belong to me because of a name tag on the back. He found my name online and contacted me through my work. He wanted to sell it back to me. I was very happy! I would have paid anything for it, but he asked a fair price.

My dad used to put name tags on everything I owned, including my guitar. He wanted me to learn the classical guitar, but I didn't like it. I preferred the electric guitar. It was the 1970s and punk music was popular. I could play simple songs and didn't need to be good.

When Keith sent me the guitar, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. I took it out of the box and it felt smooth and nice. I put it on and started playing. My fingers knew where to go. I wanted to play with my son, who is learning the saxophone. Maybe we can form a band!<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for an A2 learner:

People are talking a lot about sleep these days. When I wrote a book about people who have trouble sleeping, I felt like I was the only one warning about the dangers of not sleeping enough. Sleep is very important for our minds, bodies, and emotions. Those who have trouble sleeping know how important it is. That's why it's good that people are finally paying attention to sleep.

But what about dreams? We're not talking about dreams as much as we should. When we wake up early, we often cut off the last hour or two of sleep. This is the time when we have our most vivid and memorable dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time dreaming. When people don't get enough sleep, they have more dreams the next night.

Researchers used to think that dreams were important for understanding our minds, but they don't agree on that anymore. They now think that dreams are more about our physical health. But dreams are still important. Actors, writers, and directors are better at remembering and using their dreams because they are creative. This makes sense, because film is a creative process.

But dreams can help anyone who needs to think creatively. Teachers, software designers, and politicians need to think creatively too. Dreams help us combine different ideas and find new solutions. For example, when people wake up from a dream, they can come up with new and original ideas. I write better when I wake up from a dream. Even a bad dream can help me think more clearly.

We all need to think creatively and work well with others. We need our brains to work properly. That's why we need to dream.<|eot_id|>"

You can see many empty frames on her walls, but there are also photos of her two daughters. Susie says she doesn't have any of her own paintings because she finishes them and they sell quickly.

Susie has been copying paintings for 30 years. She has done many famous paintings, like those of Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that art experts think they are the original paintings. People pay a lot of money for her copies, depending on how long she takes to make them.

Susie won't say who her clients are, but they are galleries and private collectors. Some people buy her copies because they love art, but others want to show off their wealth. Susie says it's okay if people want to display her copies instead of the original paintings. She even knows some famous people who show off her copies as if they are the real thing.

Susie has always been honest about what she does. She makes sure her copies look as good as the original paintings. She signs her name on the back of the canvas, so people know it's not the real thing. Susie has never tried to sell a fake painting as the original because it's against the law.

Before she became a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She had to be very accurate and make sure everything was perfect. This helped her develop her skills and attention to detail. Now, she specializes in copying French impressionist paintings, like those of Manet, Cezanne, and Degas.

Some people might think it's strange that Susie doesn't make her own original paintings. They might think art is about expressing yourself.

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to climb Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. If he succeeds, he might become very famous. Jordan wants to inspire young people to go outside and be active, rather than just playing video games all the time. He is climbing with his parents, Paul and Karen, who are also experienced climbers.

Jordan's goal is not just to climb Everest, but to climb the highest mountains on each continent. He has already climbed five of them and might finish all seven before he is 16 years old. Some experienced climbers think it's not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Everest, but Jordan's parents believe they can help him be safe.

Jordan is also very strong and responsible, which gives his parents confidence. Jordan says he loves the challenge of climbing and just focuses on achieving his goal.

Jordan's adventure is also about inspiring others. He wants to show people that it's fun to be active and explore the outdoors. But he also knows that he has to be careful and make sure people are interested in what he's doing. He has to talk to the media and share his story.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's unlikely they're listening to classical music. Most people know many pop groups, but few know who Brahms was. I'm studying music, but my classmates know little about classical music too. If you don't know who wrote the music, you're unlikely to buy their recordings. The numbers are not good for classical music. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and each recording sells only 300 copies.

I think that's because classical music is not interesting to most people, especially teenagers. We like fast-paced music, and classical music is slow and has many changes. We also have trouble paying attention for more than a few minutes, which is too short for most classical music. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music requires time and concentration.

Pop music also talks about things that interest us, like our problems and feelings. Classical music is powerful, but it doesn't talk about our everyday issues. The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would play music together, and it was important to know how to play an instrument. Now, we can find any music we want easily, and classical music is not part of our daily lives.

I think it's true that some people like classical music more when they're older. In my orchestra, we play classical music in different places, but the audience is usually older. Some people say that schools are the problem, but I think it's just that classical music isn't what most teenagers like. When we want to relax, it's usually pop music we choose.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother's car and looked at Almonside School. She said, 'I'll make you sorry I came here.' Her mother was getting out of the other door, but Bonnie wouldn't have cared if she had. Her mother knew how Bonnie felt.

Mrs. Wyndham looked around. Almonside School was a funny school with many buildings hidden among the trees. It was a bit confusing at first. Then she saw signs that said 'Science block', 'gymnasium', and 'riding centre'. Bonnie saw the 'riding centre' sign and showed interest. 'Let's go see,' she said.

Bonnie followed her mother to the headmaster's office. Her mother talked to the headmaster, and Bonnie waited outside. After a few minutes, Bonnie got up and said to herself, 'Why should I just sit here?' She decided to go to the riding centre.

The riding centre was a nice old building with many horses. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She approached the horses carefully and saw that they were well taken care of. She liked horses and knew how to treat them with respect.

Bonnie walked along the stalls, looking at each horse. 'I know what they're doing here,' she said to a small pony. She liked a brown horse with a white touch. 'You're the best one here!' she said. The horse's name was Maverick. Bonnie felt like she knew Maverick before, from her dreams. She decided to ride him.

Bonnie found a saddle and bridle and put them on Maverick. She forgot about her mother and the headmaster. When she rode Maverick outside, she felt like a queen. She laughed and said, 'You're the best horse I've ever ridden, Maverick.' She rode him around the paddock and felt happy. Maverick trusted her, and she felt sure he would jump well.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

I met Cody Simpson before and was impressed by his confidence. He's a 15-year-old singer from Australia. He's already released many successful songs. So, how did he go from being a surfer to performing in front of thousands of fans? Cody started playing the guitar when he was six and writing songs when he was seven. But he loved swimming and surfing more. He was 13 and in school when he started posting videos online. These videos became very popular, and he decided to keep making more. Record labels noticed him and wanted him to sign a contract. This meant he had to choose between swimming and singing. Cody chose to move to the US with his family. He was only 13!

It was a big decision, but he knew it was important to follow his dreams. He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was leaving. They were surprised, but Cody is a quiet and modest person. He thinks it's important to stay humble in the music industry.

Cody's family is very supportive. They're not famous, but they're always there for him. Sometimes Cody worries about the impact his decision has on his little brother and sister. But his family reassures him that they're always there to support him.

Success comes when you take risks and say ""yes"" to new opportunities, even if they're scary. Cody never thought he'd be performing in so many countries, but he's grateful for the chance. He knows it won't last forever, but he's making the most of it.

I jumped out of bed and looked out of the window. The river was frozen, but there was a small crack in the ice. I could see the town's buildings on the other side, protected by big bags of sand. I had helped put them there with many people from the town. My grandfather didn't seem to care. I looked at the river and saw a boy on the other side. He was trying to walk on the ice, but it was not safe. I got dressed and went to get my special clothes for kayaking. I put on my lucky chain, a special gift from my grandfather. I read his diary before I go to sleep. I went to the kitchen to get something to eat. My mom was making breakfast. She said, ""Be careful, Rex."" I was going kayaking. My grandfather came out of his room and shouted at me. He asked where I was going. I told him I was going kayaking. He said, ""What's the point of training? You didn't win the competition."" I tried not to get upset. My mom came and said, ""Don't mind him, he's not feeling well."" I went outside to my boat and started getting ready. My mom said, ""You're very determined, Rex.

Mum grabbed Jess's arm. 'Come with me,' she said. Jess followed her to the study. There was a painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa's, but it was different from his usual style. It was not finished. 'Do you know anything about this?' Mum asked. Jess shook her head. 'I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on something new.' Jess looked at the painting. There was a river in the picture, but it didn't look like a real river. It was strange and beautiful. The riverbank was very small and hard to see. There were no animals, birds, or people in the picture. Jess felt drawn to it. Mum said, 'It has a name.' Jess looked at the words on the back of the painting. They said 'River Boy'. Jess felt a strange connection to the name. But she didn't understand why. Mum said, 'There is no boy in the picture.' Jess looked at her. 'Why did Grandpa name it that?' Mum said, 'I asked him, but he didn't explain. He said that the artist doesn't have to explain their work. Each painting has its own meaning, like a poem. Some people understand it, and some don't. Mum said, 'I was hoping you might know something about this painting, since you seem to be an inspiration for him.' Jess knew what an inspiration was. Grandpa used to say it when she watched him paint. But she thought he meant a goddess, not a person. 'He doesn't need me to inspire him,' Jess said. 'He's been painting all his life.'

I didn't mean to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I was trying to put a special cabinet in my room. It was given to me by my grandmother. The cabinet is small and has glass doors. I keep my collection of shells and stones in it. The problem is, the cabinet is shaped like a triangle and needs to stand in a corner. My room is small and has only two corners. I tried to put the cabinet in the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was too tall. I thought about cutting a small piece off the bottom of the cabinet, but then I had a better idea.

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A2 level learner:

""The TV show 'The Borrowers' is about a family of small people who live in the walls and floors of a house. They take things from the big people who live in the house to survive. When I directed the TV show, I knew it would be hard to make it good. People who love the book have strong ideas about how it should be done. I used the pictures from the book to help me. The author wanted the show to be from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the point of view of the big people. This made filming tricky. The most important thing was to get the size right. The Borrowers are 10 times smaller than big people, so we had to film them 10 times farther away. When filming the big people's surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from very low. We never raised the camera above their height, except for a few special shots. It was hard to get the shadows right when we combined the small Borrowers with big surroundings. We developed a special way to do it.

We built one big set, the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, with giant objects to make the actors look small. The actors had to carry big things like scissors and coins. It was funny and we often had to stop filming because everyone was laughing. In one scene, the Borrowers get swept down a drain. The actors had to go through a tunnel with water and they said it was very scary. I wanted the costumes to look like dolls' clothes, so they were made of heavy canvas. This made it hard for the actors to move around. The weather was very hot during filming and the actors didn't like the costumes.

We had to film most scenes with the actors separated from their surroundings. We used a blue screen and drew pictures of each scene to help the actors know what to do. I drew 2,000 pictures in the end! We had to work quickly and carefully to finish the show. It was a lot of work, but it was worth it. The show was successful and people liked it.""

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Many American teenagers have a lot of responsibilities. They are expected to do well in school, have a part-time job, and volunteer. They also need to take care of their daily tasks and responsibilities at home. Teenagers can't just blend in with the crowd; they have to stand out and achieve a lot.

People often think that teenagers have too much pressure. They have a lot of homework, tests, and activities outside of school. They also have to take care of their social life. But despite all these stresses, some people still think that teenagers are lazy, rude, and selfish.

This is not true for many teenagers. They use their phones to help them with their schoolwork and to stay in touch with their friends. They don't just use their phones to play games or watch videos. They use them to learn new things and stay organized.

Teenagers often have a busy schedule. They wake up early and go to bed late. They have to do their homework, attend school, and take part in activities. Many teenagers don't get enough sleep. A survey found that 20% of teenagers get the recommended 9 hours of sleep a night. Some teenagers even fall asleep in school because they are so tired.

Despite all their responsibilities, many teenagers still find time to help others. They volunteer and do activities that help their community. One teenager, Lindamarie, spends most of her free time volunteering. She thinks that people have the wrong idea about teenagers. They think that teenagers are only interested in themselves, but Lindamarie believes that many teenagers care about making a positive impact on the world.

In the future, the stereotype of teenagers may change. But for now, they are proving that they are capable of achieving great things and making a difference.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in a town called Bishop, surrounded by wilderness. They have launched over 50 balloons into space, and it's a fun project that combines science and adventure. I joined them on a weekend in spring to help them launch a new balloon. They wanted to record shooting stars, which are bright streaks of light that happen when a rock or piece of metal enters the Earth's atmosphere.

The balloon had a special box attached to it with a camera, a device to measure the altitude, and a thermometer to measure the temperature. They also put two GPS trackers on the box so they could find it later. A gas tank inflated the balloon, which grew to the size of a small car.

When it was time to launch the balloon, they counted down and it started to rise. Some of them ran to follow it with flashlights and watched it disappear into the night. After the launch, some of the students stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountain and looked at the very clear sky.

The balloon would eventually pop and a parachute would help the box land safely back on Earth. The students would use the GPS trackers to find it the next day. It's not always easy to find the box, but that's part of the fun. The landscape around Bishop is very wild, so they often have to drive or walk for a long time to find it.

On this occasion, it took them 11 hours to find the box, which was in a canyon with a waterfall. Unfortunately, the camera didn't record any shooting stars, but they were happy to discuss the science behind it and share their adventure story with others.

Chloe Morgan didn't like science much until she was 15. She was helping her younger brother with a school project and found an article about dinosaurs.

Chloe remembers meeting a professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, for the first time. She was nervous, but he was kind and patient. He answered all her questions and made her feel comfortable.

Chloe thinks that movies and TV shows often show palaeontologists in a bad light. They are often shown as strange or boring people. But Chloe's job is not like that. She spends most of her time digging up dinosaur bones, studying them, and writing about her findings. She also likes to explain science to the public and help people understand it better.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

When you're going on a car trip with your family, you might ask 'Are we there yet?' even when you're just a child. But the truth is, even when you finally arrive, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here'. So, you should ask 'Are we here yet?' instead.

I think many parents get tired of answering this question over and over. They wish they could just relax and enjoy the trip. But kids like to ask because they don't have to do anything. They can watch movies, listen to music, or play with puzzles while looking out the window at the nice views.

Sometimes, brothers and sisters can get a bit naughty and start fighting. This can make the trip unpleasant. Parents try to keep everyone calm and happy by giving them snacks and adjusting the music. But sometimes, kids can be very annoying and do things that make their siblings angry.

My brother Tim and I used to fight a lot in the car. We would push each other and try to take each other's space. Our parents would have to stop the car and tell us to calm down. They would say things like'stay in your own seat' and 'keep your hands to yourself'.

After a while, we would calm down and the trip would continue. Sometimes, my brother would try to make me angry by blowing on my arm. He would do this when he was sitting on his own side of the seat. I would get angry and we would start fighting again.

Our parents have learned ways to deal with us kids on long car trips. For example, they might say 'we're there' when we're still on the highway. This would make us quiet for a while. But we knew we weren't really there yet.

When we finally arrived at our destination, our parents would get out of the car and go far away from us. This meant we had finally arrived. So, remember, if your parents are still near, the answer is 'no, you're not there yet'.'<|eot_id|>"

John and Zuzi Morgan have a special café in Oxford, UK. People can go there to drink coffee and eat cake, and also play board games. The owners want people to enjoy themselves so much that they want to come back. Zuzi says, ""We wanted to bring people together again. Everyone is busy on their phones and gadgets. We want to help people talk to each other and have fun together.""

The games they play in the café are called 'Eurogames'. They are games that are not too complicated and have nice themes, like farming or building things. The first game like this was called 'The Settlers of Catan'. Players build settlements and trade things with each other. It's a fun game that everyone can play together.

Another game, called 'Pandemic', was created by a man named Matt Leacock. Players work together to solve problems. Matt wanted to make a game that was like a story, where everyone feels good at the end, whether they win or lose.

Matt loves playing games and used to get frustrated when he was a child. He would try to make his own games with the pieces from other games. 'Pandemic' was very successful and Matt made another version that is even better. It has a lot of storytelling and is like an electronic game.

The rise of video games has actually helped board games become more popular. Many people play games on their phones, and this has made people want to play games with others in person. John and Zuzi's café is very popular, and people enjoy playing games together.

When he was growing up, he only listened to old music on the radio. He didn't hear a modern song until he was 12 years old.

Jamie had to choose between playing tennis and music. He was good at tennis and played at a high level, but he didn't want to play it for the rest of his life. He decided to focus on music. At 17, he left school to try to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend, but they didn't share the same passion for music. Jamie's parents gave him a deadline to make it in the music industry. If he didn't succeed, he would have to get a job.

After some near misses, Jamie was signed to a music publisher when he was 19. However, record labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to leave his friend. It was behind the scenes that he found success. He wrote songs for other artists and helped launch their careers.

Jamie believes that writing songs that are popular is important. He thinks it's okay to write songs that people like and want to listen to. He doesn't care if people think it's not ""cool"" to write big hits. His goal is to write songs that people will love and remember.

Do you want to know what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at a place called Circus Experience, where she teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it teaches many different skills, like juggling, throwing and catching balls, and even doing tricks on the trapeze. On the course, students learn new things each week and parents come to watch them. Sophia says that to be a good circus performer, you need to keep practicing and trying new things. It's also important to be friends with other performers and learn from them. You need to be fit and exercise every day to stay strong. The most important thing is to want to be good and never stop improving.

Some people think that working in the circus means you might get hurt or only work for a short time each year. But Sophia says that's not true. The real challenge is planning for the future because you can only travel with the circus when you're young. After that, you need to think about other options. The course also teaches students how to plan a business. Many students have started their own businesses all over the world and are happy to share their stories. Sophia warns that working in the circus is not a job for making a lot of money. It's a job that requires a lot of hard work and can be competitive, but it's also very fun!<|eot_id|>"

Some people think that backing singers aren't good enough to be the main singer. But that's not true! They have to be very good. Mariam is one of these great singers.

""I love my job because I never know what I'll be asked to sing,"" she says. ""It could be a classical song, a jazz song, a hip-hop song, or even a funny song for a radio or advertisement. Sometimes producers ask me to sing in a funny way, like singing like a fish! But I never argue, I just do my job.""

To be a good backing singer, you need to have excellent musical skills and be able to learn quickly. Sometimes there's no music sheet to help you, so you have to remember everything. I remember my first time recording music for a movie. It was very difficult because there were eight of us singing different songs and an orchestra too. I was very scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again. That's not fun!

She believed in her idea.

Julie's mother helped her from the beginning. She's not a business expert, but she's good with people and design. Julie got ideas for her designs from children's storybooks. She didn't know much about fashion blogs, but they helped her business grow. At first, she sold only one satchel a week. To get more attention, Julie sent satchels to fashion writers and asked them to write about them. They liked her satchels, and soon people started to buy more. Julie's company makes satchels faster now.

Julie loves seeing which famous person is using her satchel next. Instead of spending money on advertising, she uses the internet to find new and exciting ideas. Sometimes, another company copied her design, so now Julie makes sure her production team is very good. People who visit her office say it's a happy place to work. Julie's company has a new factory now, and it's the team that makes it special.

Vicky Harmiston grew up with a lot of freedom to choose what she did in her free time. She and her brother Jamie loved playing different sports. Vicky was good at swimming, but it was hard for her to go to training sessions because it was far from her home. When she and Jamie were teenagers, Jamie started riding a special bike and competing in races. Vicky thought it looked fun and decided to try it too. She loved it and started riding every day. It was easy for her to go to training sessions after school because the track was near her school.

Vicky became very good at cycling and won many competitions. When she was 28, she stopped competing and started a new job. She works for a charity called CycleZone. The charity helps young people who don't like sports. They teach them to ride a bike and help them believe in themselves. Vicky thinks it's a great job because it brings young people together.

Some people think that when famous people help charities, it's not good because they only do it to get attention. But Vicky thinks if famous people can help, they should.<|eot_id|>"

Ana Ronson is a singer-songwriter from Ireland. She grew up in a house where music was always playing. Her grandfather taught her and her brother how to play the guitar. Ana was very nervous when she first sang in front of a group at school. Her teacher suggested she join the school theatre club to help her feel more confident. Ana liked the club and sang with 50 other students at a concert. Later, her brother asked her to write a song for his band. She wrote her first song, ""Falling Stars"", in just three days. Ana liked writing so much that she took a songwriting course with a professional teacher. The teacher didn't listen to her ideas, so Ana wrote a song called ""Something to Say"" about how she felt. She put the song on the internet and it became very popular. Many people liked it and found new meanings in the words each time they listened. A music company owner, Joss Alton, flew to meet Ana and asked her to join his company, Isotope Music. Ana was hesitant at first, but Joss reassured her that she would be free to write her own songs. Ana performed at a concert in Dublin and it was a big success. She likes to write songs about things that matter to her, like when her brother stopped singing and how it made him unhappy. Ana hopes that people will like her songs, but her main goal is to write about her own experiences.<|eot_id|>"

Last year, I went on a big trip to the west coast of Canada. My brother Harry, who is a journalist, wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don't. I had always wanted to visit this place because our great-grandparents used to live there. I kept asking Harry if I could come, and he finally said yes.

There was a storm a few days before we left, but the weather was supposed to be calm when we arrived. Harry took care of everything, so I didn't have to worry. When we got to Canada, we joined a group and went on small boats. The guide told us that not many people live along the coast, and we only saw dolphins and birds on our first morning. We couldn't see the islands because of the fog, so I just looked at the patterns our boat made in the water.

We stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches. They had many colorful fish, and I didn't recognize some of them. It was great to not worry about time and just enjoy the day. We had lunch and dinner together over campfires. When we went to sleep on the boats, it felt like a stress-free life, even though the beds were hard.

When it was time to leave, I was sad. I didn't want to go back to my normal life. But I knew I would miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also excited to tell everyone at home about our adventures.

I made some changes to the text to make it easier for an A2 learner, including:

My dad was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father. When I was a kid, I went to watch many of his games. You might think that seeing so many matches would make me love the sport, but it didn't. I liked telling my friends about my dad's games, especially when he won. But I usually took a book with me to read instead of watching the game.

When I was still a kid, I was already very tall. My sports teacher asked if I wanted to join the basketball team. I was a bit scared, but the teacher thought I could do it. It took me a while to agree, but I started playing with the team. My parents came to watch, but it made me nervous. But I did okay in the end!

For four years, I practiced every day and got better and better. I even joined an adult team before I moved to the USA when I was 15. The coach there was very good and worked with Olympic basketball players. I had to get used to living away from my parents, but I got used to it. My English improved quickly too!

I became a professional basketball player at 18, three years after moving to the USA. I was already taller than most players, but I was too light for my height. So, I had to work on that. My coach knew a team that would take me while I was still in college, so I joined them. I'm glad I did!

I made some changes to the original text to make it more accessible to an A2 learner, such as:

I studied tourism in college, but I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I became a weekend tour guide in my hometown, Chicago. I enjoyed showing tourists around the city and saw it in a new way. After finishing my studies, I decided to make tour guiding my full-time job.

But, I soon realized that it's not as easy as I thought. To become a licensed tour guide, I had to learn a lot more than I already knew. I had to know answers to many questions about Chicago's history, architecture, and transportation. It took some time, but I got my qualification and became an independent tour guide.

As a tour guide, you need to be good at many things. You should be able to tell interesting stories and make the tour fun. You also need to be able to handle unexpected problems, like a place being closed or a change in the route. Tourists want to have a good time, not hear about problems. I make sure visitors are happy with my tours, or they might write a bad review online. Good reviews help me get more customers, so I try to make my tours fun and stress-free. I'm proud of my good reviews and happy that my tours are recommended to other visitors in Chicago.<|eot_id|>"

My name is Ella. I'm 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand with my sister Josie. She is five years younger than me. We went to help at an elephant sanctuary. This is a place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, we were worried because we were the only young volunteers. But we soon became friends with the other volunteers. Our job was to collect food for the elephants. Elephants eat a lot of grass and bananas. It took most of the day to collect the food. Josie found it hard work, but it was worth it to see the elephants happy. We also helped wash the elephants in the river. I had a lot of fun, even though I got wet! My favorite part of the day was the evening. We would walk the elephants to a special forest area where they would sleep. All the volunteers lived in the same house. Josie and I shared a room, so we didn't have much space. But we didn't mind. The food was delicious and didn't have meat, which we don't like. After dinner, we would talk and play games with the other volunteers and staff. Now that we're back in the UK, Josie doesn't talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she liked it, she says she loved it. I think she might be a little sad that she didn't make the most of her time because she missed her friends.

My name is Gina D'Costa. I run a flower shop in the UK. I sell flowers to many different kinds of customers. Hotels and offices like to have flowers in their reception areas. Sometimes, I help with photo shoots for businesses by providing flowers for their pictures. I even decorated a castle for a wedding once! It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of what we did.

My day starts very early, at 4 a.m. I go to the flower market to buy fresh flowers. It's usually dark and cold, but I don't mind. I like being at the market. There are many different types of flowers from all around the world. It's hard to choose which ones to buy because there are so many beautiful ones! But I have to think about what my customers want, not just what I like. Not all flowers are available all the time, so I have to be careful.

When I get back to the shop, we sort through the orders and put the flowers in vases. Then we make bunches of flowers and figure out how much they cost. Sometimes customers are surprised by how expensive the flowers are, so I have to ask them to think about what they want. Some people might think this is too much work, but I like making sure the flowers are nice and the customers are happy. I wouldn't want to do any other job!<|eot_id|>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows new films. I wanted to watch movies with friends and talk about them afterwards. So, I started a film club with two friends. We didn't want to rent a cinema, so we chose a different place in the city each month. Sometimes we use old buildings, like an old factory. It's fun! Some places are free because the owners make money from selling snacks. We don't make a profit, we just want to cover our costs. We have our own equipment now, so it's easier to show films. We also know how many people are coming because we sell tickets online. It's nice to see people of all ages saying they had a great time. We have a website and are friends with other film clubs. We visit them and learn new things. We also have a blog and put up posters in cafes. But the best way to find out about us is when people tell their friends. We do special activities with each film, like a movie quiz last month. Everyone liked it!

I loved taking pictures when I was a child. When I was 15, I thought I wanted to take my hobby to the next level. So, I decided to take one picture every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea. After a few weeks, I put my pictures on a website for young photographers. I was happy to share my photos and show others what I liked to take pictures of. I was surprised to find that others liked my style. I liked taking pictures of nature, especially birds and the sky. Most of my pictures were in black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing. Sometimes I doubted my project and thought about giving up. But I trusted my feelings and became more confident in my style. My art teacher at school told me about a national photography competition for young people. I entered some of my pictures just for fun. I was very happy when the judges told me I won first prize!

When I first joined, my leader suggested I help at a local children's club for two hours a week. I was a bit worried because I had tried to join that club before when I was eight and it was hard for me to make friends. But I decided to try again because I wanted the certificate. Surprisingly, I started to really enjoy it and wanted to go back every week. I even got to keep helping at the club because I made friends with the children. Now I go for about four hours a week and it's my favourite thing to do. Because of what I learned at the children's club, I think I might want to be a youth worker when I grow up.

I was born in Denver, USA. When I was eight years old, my dad took me to a mountain resort two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try snowboarding. I didn't think about asking him if I could try it, but he loved it and wanted me to like it too. He made it look easy, and I was able to do it. After that, I loved snowboarding and got better at it. I started competing when I was ten.

Some people get bored of snowboarding, but I love it more and more as I get older. It's fun to not have a plan and sometimes it goes well. I was the first girl to get a perfect score at a local competition. I wasn't sure if I would try the jumps until I started doing them. It made me feel more confident in my abilities.

In the summer, I focus on training and studying. I train every day, but I don't have to follow a strict diet like I do in the winter. I also spend time with my friends. It's nice to have something else to do besides snowboarding. I have to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life, but I also think it's important to have something else in case I'm not good enough to be a professional or if I get hurt. Maybe I could be a doctor.

When I was 15, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't think about the future. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it if I worked part-time and saved money. I learned a lot from this experience. I worked in a café every Saturday, but I didn't enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own small business instead. I liked making things, so I asked my mum to teach me how to make necklaces. I thought it would be hard, but it was easy! My friends thought it was boring, but I liked it. I sold my necklaces to my friends and family. They told me they liked them, but I wasn't sure if they were really good. So, I rented a market stall with my mum. Many tourists came to our stall and bought my necklaces. People from all over the country called us to buy more. They thought we were a big company, but we were just two people! That's when I knew my business could work. Now, I make a lot of money online and still have my market stall. It's been a lot of fun.

My name is Tom. I'm 15 years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad got a new job as the castle's manager. He works for a group that takes care of old buildings and makes sure people can visit them. My dad was happy, but we weren't sure at first. We were worried about living on an island with no school and a castle that might not be as comfortable as our old home.

But we got used to island life quickly. Our apartment in the castle is cozy, and we like it. In the summer, lots of people visit the island, and we have parties on the beach. In the winter, we only see the other families who live here, and there aren't many teenagers. The adults help each other and work together to fix things on the island. It can be hard work, but we do it together.

The biggest change for me was having to travel to school every day by boat. I liked going on the boat when it was stormy, but the ferry doesn't run when it's too rough. I also have to be careful not to miss the bus to the harbor after school, or I'll miss the last ferry home. When my friends come to visit, I tell them to hurry up so we don't miss the ferry.

We have amazing views on the island. Sometimes the sun sets over the sea, and it's beautiful. Sometimes it's foggy, but then the sun comes out again, and it's still amazing. We have big storms sometimes, and I worry about the castle getting damaged. But it's been here for a long time, and it's still standing.

I live in a beautiful countryside in Scotland. I love nature and animals. Six years ago, I started a new hobby - birdwatching! I went to the mountains with my family and saw many birds. My parents taught me how to tell the difference between birds and where to find them. It was amazing! After that, I joined a local birdwatching club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different birds. I've almost reached my goal because I've seen birds from other countries when we go on holiday. We always look for places where we can see birds together. I went to Egypt and South America last summer. I didn't see my 200th bird, but I learned that it's important to be patient. I shared a video about my challenge online and many people liked it. My teachers asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I was a little nervous, but I did it! The teachers said I did well and they enjoyed it. I might do another presentation next year! I'm lucky to live in the countryside because there are many birds to see. I think birdwatching clubs should try to get more young people interested in this hobby. Everyone should connect with nature, and it doesn't have to cost much money.

In the UK and other countries, there has been a change in how students learn. Now, students are encouraged to start doing research early in their studies. This is because research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It's a way to build knowledge and skills that can be useful in many areas of life.

As a student, you can contribute to knowledge by asking questions and finding answers. You don't just repeat what you're told; you make new discoveries. Asking questions like ""Why?"", ""How?"", and ""What if?"" is a natural part of research.

Research can be simple or complex. At one end, it's like solving a big problem that changes the world. At the other end, it's like asking questions and finding answers about everyday things. Most students have already been doing research without realizing it. You've probably asked questions and found answers in school or at work.

As a student, you're expected to think critically and question what you read or hear. You shouldn't just accept what others say as true. You need to think about it, test it, and make sure it's logical and backed by evidence. Don't just take things for granted; make your own discoveries.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Cities have always been important places for learning and creativity. In the past, people would gather in coffee shops to talk about new ideas. Today, we still see this in cities like Paris, where artists like Pablo Picasso would discuss their work. But city life can be difficult. Cities can be overwhelming and stressful. Scientists are now studying how cities affect our brains and the results are surprising. They found that cities can actually make us less smart and creative. One reason is that cities don't have enough nature. Studies show that patients in hospitals recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even just looking at nature for a short time can improve our brain's performance.

For the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of living in the countryside, we are surrounded by concrete and many people. This can affect our mental and physical health and how we think. When we walk in a busy city, our brain has to work hard to focus on many things at once, like pedestrians, traffic, and maps. This can make us tired.

Scientists have a theory called attention restoration theory. They think that nature can help our brains rest and recover. Natural places don't require as much effort to focus, so our brains can relax and recharge. This is important because our brains are like supercomputers, but paying attention takes a lot of energy.

Philosophers and landscape architects have been warning about the effects of cities on our minds and looking for ways to bring nature into cities. Parks like Central Park in New York can help us relax and improve our brain function. Taking a walk in nature can be more effective than trying to improve our brains in other ways.

Despite the challenges of city life, cities continue to be important places for learning and creativity. Research shows that the same features that can make cities overwhelming can also lead to innovation. The key is to find ways to make cities better for our minds while keeping their benefits.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Do we only think with our brains? This might seem like a strange question. We know that our brains are very important for thinking, and we have special machines that can show us what's happening inside our heads. But I think we should also think about what's outside our heads. For a long time, people have used things like stones, tools, and writing to help them think and solve problems. These things are not just objects; they are part of our thinking process.

Many people think that the mind is just inside our heads, but I believe that our minds are connected to the world around us. We use things to help us think, and those things can change the way we think. For example, a blind person uses a stick to feel their way around. The stick is not just a tool; it's part of the person's body.

I have a theory called Material Engagement Theory (MET). It says that things can be part of our thinking and can even change the way we think. We use things to help us understand the world, and those things can make our minds stronger. This means that our minds are not finished; they are always changing and growing.

This idea might seem strange, but it's true. Humans have been using things to help them think for a long time. We use sticks, stones, and even computers to help us solve problems and understand the world. This is what makes us human. We are always finding new ways to use things to help us think and make our minds stronger.

Photography has changed the way we live and think about the world. In the United States, photography became very popular very quickly and became part of everyday life. Many people think that photography is the country's most important contribution to the visual arts. 

Photography was appealing because it was a new and exciting technology. It was like having a magic window that could show us the world in a new way. People loved taking pictures of themselves and their families because it was a way to capture memories and show them to others. 

Photographs are special because they can show us what really happened, but they can also be influenced by the person taking the picture. When we look at a photograph, we need to think about why it was taken and what it means in the context of its time and place. 

Photography has also become an important part of art. Many artists use photographs in their work, and some even use them as the main subject. Photography is no longer a secret, and it is now an important tool for artists.

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A2 learner:

William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the'science of mental life' in 1890. This definition is still important today. We all have thoughts and feelings, and we know what these are because they are personal and private. We learn about the world through our own experiences and thoughts. This is different from science, which tries to find facts that are true for everyone.

Psychologists study how people think and feel. They try to understand why people behave in certain ways. They also try to find out what makes people happy or unhappy. Sometimes, people think they know the answers to these questions, but psychologists use special methods to find out what is really true.

It's hard to study the mind because it's not like a machine that we can see and touch. Psychologists have to study how people behave and use this information to make educated guesses about what's going on inside their minds. They have to be careful and use scientific methods to make sure their findings are correct.

Psychologists want to understand the mind so they can help people. They can use their knowledge to make new teaching methods, design safer machines, and help people who are feeling sad or upset. Psychology has been studied for a long time, but it's only been a science for about 150 years. In the past, people used to try to understand the mind by thinking about their own thoughts and feelings. However, this method has its limits. Today, psychologists prefer to study how other people behave and think to understand the mind.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

In a big warehouse in Michigan, USA, there is a special collection of failed products. This collection is called the Museum of Failed Products. It has many strange and unusual products that nobody wanted to buy. The owner of the museum, Carol Sherry, thinks that each product has its own sad story about why it failed.

The museum is special because it is a business that makes money. Many companies would like to have a collection like this, but they don't. The people who visit the museum every week are surprised to see so many failed products.

The museum was started by a man named Robert McMath, who collected a sample of every new product he found. He didn't mean to collect failed products, but most products fail. He didn't realize this until he looked at his collection.

Many companies have a culture of being optimistic and positive. They want to think that their products will be successful. But sometimes, this can make them ignore the problems with their products and not try to fix them. This can lead to more failures.

Some people think that thinking positively about the future can help us achieve our goals. But research shows that this is not always true. In fact, thinking too much about how well things will go can actually make us less motivated to work hard.

Psychologists have studied how people think about failure. They found that some people think that ability is fixed and can't be changed. If they fail, they feel bad because they think they are not good enough. Other people think that ability can be developed through hard work and practice. They see failure as an opportunity to learn and get better.

Overall, the Museum of Failed Products is a reminder that failure is a natural part of life and business. It can be a good way to learn and grow, but it's also important to be realistic and not be too optimistic.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A2 level learner:

Sports teams usually do better when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think they know the answer, but scientists and people who make money from sports are not so sure. They are asking questions and looking for answers.

Some people think that playing at home helps because the players feel more comfortable and confident. They know the place and the crowd is cheering for them. But others say that if the players are paid a lot of money, they should feel comfortable anywhere.

Fans think that their team needs their support and energy to win. But is that really true? Maybe fans just remember the times when their team scored a goal and forget the times when they didn't.

Scientists have done some experiments to find out why home advantage is important. They found that referees make different decisions when they hear the crowd cheering. They are less likely to make decisions that might make the crowd angry.

Home advantage has been getting smaller over time. In the past, home teams used to win more often, but now they win less often. Some people think this is because players are treated better and travel is easier now. But despite these changes, home advantage is still important in some sports.

For example, in basketball and football, playing at home helps a lot. But in baseball, it doesn't matter as much. This might be because baseball is a game where individual players are important, not just the team.

Some researchers think that home advantage is connected to a feeling of belonging and wanting to protect your home. This feeling can make players work harder and be more confident. It's like defending your territory.

Overall, home advantage is a complex issue, and there is no simple answer. But it's clear that it's an important part of sports.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Gary Player, a famous golfer, said ""The more I practise, the luckier I get."" But what did he really mean? He was being ironic and meant ""The more I practise, the better I get."" This quote is famous because it's hard to understand. Some people think it's about whether you're born with talent or if you can learn it. 

Many experts agree that practice is important. A psychologist named Anders Ericsson said that with 10,000 hours of practice, you can become an expert in anything. Many books have been written about this idea. But a new book by Epstein says that it's not always true. He thinks that some people might be naturally good at things because of their genes. 

Epstein looked at many examples to understand why some people are better than others. He even went to Alaska to learn about sled dogs and found that their drive and desire might be because of their genes. He thinks that both nature (what you're born with) and nurture (what you learn) are important. 

Epstein also talks about how some people are naturally better at certain things because of their genes. He looks at examples of athletes and asks why some people are so good at certain sports. He also talks about how men and women are separated in sports and asks why that is. 

The main idea of the text is that it's not always easy to understand why some people are better than others. It's not just about practice or talent, but about a mix of both.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A2 level learner:

Many children in rich countries feel unhappy and lonely. Jay Griffiths asks, ""Why are today's children so unhappy?"" In her book, Kith, she says that children are unhappy because they spend too much time indoors, playing with screens, and they don't get to play outside as much. This is the main problem.

A study talked to children and found that they didn't want more gadgets; they just wanted to go outside more. Many adults remember their own childhoods and how they spent their days playing outside, exploring, and having fun. They think this was better than the way children live today.

Griffiths argues that the fear of danger makes parents keep their children indoors, and this helps the toy and gadget industry sell more things to keep children entertained. She also talks about how some schools prescribe medicine for children who are restless or make them wear goggles for playground games. Griffiths thinks this is silly and wants children to have more freedom.

The problem is that Griffiths sometimes goes too far and doesn't consider the other side of the argument. She thinks children are naturally good and that they should be allowed to take risks. She believes that children need to have some small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones. However, she doesn't say how to make this happen. Some people might think that not all children want to take risks, and that's okay too.

The main idea of the book is that children should be allowed to have autonomy, to explore, and to take risks. Griffiths thinks that this is important for children's development.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

I'm a psychologist who has studied a lot. I'm good at solving problems, but not because of what I learned in school. Most problems can't be solved with formulas or memorized answers. They need judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. Children learn these things through play.

My research focuses on the importance of play for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they're young. The more they have to learn, the more they play. Children play a lot because they have a lot to learn.

Play is how animals, including humans, have always learned. The most important skills children need to live happy, productive lives can't be taught in school. These skills are learned through play, like thinking creatively, getting along with others, and controlling their emotions.

Creativity is important for success. We need people who can think creatively and solve new problems. Playful people are creative people. Even famous scientists like Albert Einstein played as children and used their imagination to come up with new ideas.

But schools often make play impossible. They give too much homework, reduce breaks, and focus too much on grades. This is bad for children. They need to play freely, without adults telling them what to do. If we want our children to grow up strong and happy, we need to give them more playtime and let them make their own choices.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to find a job. They use websites like Twitter and LinkedIn to talk to potential employers. These websites can be very helpful, but it's easy to make mistakes. 

A young jobseeker in the US sent a message to a marketing executive on LinkedIn. The executive had many important contacts, and the jobseeker thought she could help him get a job. But the executive was angry and sent a mean message. This made many people sad and angry. 

The executive showed that using social media for work can be tricky. Many young people don't know how to use it correctly. They think it's like their social media from when they were teenagers. 

When we were teenagers, social media was a place to be ourselves and have fun. We could be anyone we wanted to be online. But when we use social media for work, it's different. We need to be professional and respectful.

Some young people make mistakes on professional networking sites. They write messages that are too casual or even rude. This can make employers think they're arrogant or entitled. 

To make a good impression, it's important to be clear and respectful in your messages. Explain who you are and what you can do for the person you're contacting. Don't send generic messages, and be humble. Remember, social media can be helpful, but it needs to be used correctly.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, rewritten for an A2 level learner:

Newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, many newspapers in the UK have lost between a third and half of their readers. In the USA, a research centre says that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26% of people, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people think that newspapers will disappear completely within 15 years. But, old media often survive. For example, books, theatre, and cinema have all survived despite new technologies coming along.

Newspapers were once new and exciting, but it took a long time for them to become popular. This was because it was hard to print and distribute news quickly and cheaply until the 19th century. People used to think that the world was a steady and predictable place, but now we expect things to change all the time.

Before newspapers, people didn't need news as much because their lives were more simple. They didn't have the same kind of news that we have today. Now, we can get news whenever we want and we can choose what we want to read. The internet has made it easy to get news and to correct mistakes quickly.

Newspapers have never been very good at explaining how the world works. Maybe they will disappear, or maybe they will find a new way to help us understand the world.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

'If humans lived in the dark, we would feel at home. But we are creatures that live in the daylight. This is because our bodies are used to being in the sun's light. We don't think about it, but it's important. Because of this, we have changed the night by using lots of artificial light. This is like building a dam to control the river. It has good effects, but also bad ones. The bad effects are called light pollution. It's because we don't use the light correctly. We shine it upwards into the sky, instead of downwards where it's needed. This makes it hard for many living things to adapt to the night. Even humans are affected.

In the past, cities didn't have many lights. People used candles and lanterns. You could smell the city, but not see it. Now, we have lit up the night like it's an empty country. But it's not empty. There are many animals that live at night. Light is very important to them. It's like a magnet that attracts them. Some birds get stuck in searchlights and fly around until they get tired.

We thought light pollution only affected astronomers, who need to see the stars clearly. But it affects all living things. We need darkness to be healthy. If we don't get enough darkness, our bodies don't work properly. We need to go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day. This is because our bodies are used to the day and night rhythms.

We have cut ourselves off from our natural world by using too much light. We forget how small we are in the universe. We should remember the stars and the night sky. It's important to use light correctly so we can be healthy and happy.'

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

A big company has decided not to keep track of how many holidays its employees take. This idea came from another company that has been doing this for a while. The founder of the big company says that employees can take as much time off as they want as long as they are sure it won't affect the business. However, this might not be practical for a big company with many employees and different departments. It's hard to know if someone's absence will really affect the business, especially if they work in a different department.

The founder of the big company says that employees should only take time off if they are sure that their work is up to date and won't be affected by their absence. But it's hard to be 100% sure about this. Even if you prepare well for a holiday, there is always a lot of work to come back to. This can make people feel guilty and stressed, which can negatively affect their work.

In the past, employees had a certain amount of paid holiday time, which was protected by law. This gave them a sense of security and allowed them to take time off without worrying about their jobs. If the company doesn't keep track of holidays, employees might not take any time off at all, or they might feel guilty about taking it. This could lead to a decrease in productivity and morale.

The way we work has changed with technology, and it's hard to separate work and leisure time. Some people might feel like they are always working, even when they're not. This can be stressful and affect their well-being. Employment laws exist to protect workers' rights, including their right to take time off. I'm not sure if this new policy is a good idea or if it will really work as intended.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text:

Journal-based peer review is a way to check if a scientific research paper is good. It's like a filter that helps prevent bad or wrong papers from being published. Some people think it's very important, but others think it's not perfect. It can take a long time to review a paper, up to a year. Is it worth waiting that long to make sure the paper is good? Maybe yes, maybe no.

I think journal-based peer review is still important, but I also think we need to change the way we do it. One way to do this is by using preprints. Preprints are drafts of papers that are shared online before they are reviewed. This helps people share their research quickly and get feedback from others.

Some people are worried that using preprints will let bad science get published. But this hasn't happened so far. Preprints are open to feedback and discussion from anyone, so people can see the arguments and decide for themselves.

Preprints can also help with something important called ""negative results."" This is when scientists find something that doesn't work or doesn't make sense. Journals often don't publish these results, but preprints can help share them with others.

By using preprints, we can make scientific research more open and accessible. This will help us focus on the research itself, not just where it's published.<|eot_id|>"

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it's like a picture made with words. But I don't think that's a good answer. One day, I asked them to write a paragraph about an object, like a scientist would, and then another paragraph from the object's point of view, called ""Poem."" One student wrote about an oxygen mask. It was a strange choice, but it helped us understand how poetry is special.

When I was at school, I didn't understand poetry. It seemed like a puzzle that got in the way of feeling and understanding. Now, most people don't read poetry much. Sometimes you see a poem and it's different from other writing. It's like a challenge to read it, and sometimes it's not very interesting. But people like to read it because it can make them feel deep emotions.

So, what do we want to find in a poem? We want to feel something deep, see beautiful pictures, and have new thoughts. But we can find those things in other things too, like movies or music. Poetry is special because it can be unclear. And in our daily lives, we have unclear things too. 

So, what is a poem? Some people say it's like a machine or a wild animal, but those comparisons don't work. The important thing is to think about what a poem is and how it makes us feel. Poems can be stuck in our heads like a song. And sometimes, a poem on a page can make us feel something strong, even though it's just words on paper.

I bought a metal detector after I got married. It was expensive, but my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. I've been finding old things for many years, and it's always exciting. But it wasn't until 40 years later that I found something as special as the first ring. It was a rainy day, and I was searching in a field where old farming equipment was buried. My detector beeped, and I dug up a piece of a wheel. Then it beeped again. I couldn't leave without knowing what it was. After digging half a meter deep, I saw a golden ball. I thought it might be a piece of old curtain rail, but as I cleaned it, it became clear it was a beautiful, intricate necklace. I had seen something like it before - the Great Torc, in the British Museum. It's a famous necklace from ancient times. I took it home and showed it to Marion. We were both very excited. We didn't try it on, because it might get damaged. We hid it in our wardrobe, but I was worried about it being stolen. So, I hid it under a floorboard in my office. The law says I had to give it to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy it for a bit longer, so I took it to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office. The person in charge was surprised and authenticated it. It was sold to my local council, and the money was split between the landowner and me. The £350,000 was a lot of money! But the Torc is more than just a lucky find. It's something I've saved for everyone. People ask me if I'll stop detecting now, but I won't.

Sleep is one of my favorite things to do when I travel. But I don't talk about it much because I feel a little guilty. When my friends tell me about their trips, they always have a lot of plans and activities. They visit museums, go hiking, and do many other things. When they tell me about their trips, I smile and don't say much. But my trips are different. I like to take long naps in the afternoon and sleep in late in the morning. I think this is because I am more relaxed when I travel. I don't have to wake up early or worry about what I have to do.

I remember one trip to Mexico when I was young. I slept a lot because it was hot and noisy. But it was a deep, peaceful sleep. I felt happy and relaxed. When I travel, I like to sleep because it helps me feel more calm and relaxed. I think this is because I am not worried about my daily routine or what I have to do.

When I sleep while traveling, I dream about the new places I am visiting. I remember the sounds, smells, and sights of the places I have been. This makes me happy and I feel like I am really experiencing the place.

I think sleeping while traveling is an important part of the experience. It helps me relax and enjoy my trip more. I should not feel guilty about taking naps and sleeping in late. It is okay to take time to rest and enjoy the place I am visiting.

It was a mix of brown and green, and I could see no people. I shook my head. My neighbour, Sergei, woke up and smiled at me. He was a salesman from Moscow who was going to sell special clothes to people who work in mines. He didn't speak much English, but I told him I was going to a city called Magadan in Siberia. I only had a one-way ticket and planned to ride my bike back to England. Sergei didn't think it was a good idea because there was no road from Magadan.

Before the flight, I had to sign two forms. One said I was healthy, and the other said I would empty my pockets because small things can be dangerous during the flight. I also learned that I had to stay focused and know which way to look. The pilot told me to relax and enjoy the view when we're upside down.

When we got ready to take off, I felt a bit scared. The pilot, Dario, and I sat in the plane, the Zivko Edge 540. It's a very fast plane! We took off and did a sharp turn to the right.

Doug Allan is a cameraman who films wild animals in cold places. He has filmed many documentaries about polar bears and other animals in cold environments. He likes the cold weather and has been working in this field for 35 years.

Doug used to be a marine biologist and commercial diver. He learned about survival in cold places while diving. One day, a TV crew came to Antarctica where he was working, and he helped them film a wildlife documentary. He loved the job and decided to become a wildlife cameraman.

It was a good time to start his career because not many people had been to the Antarctic before. He became known as the ""cold man"" and was able to capture amazing footage of animals in their natural habitats.

When Doug started, filming was more difficult. He had to remember what he had filmed and plan his shots carefully. Now, with digital technology, he can film a lot and review it immediately.

Doug's experience in cold conditions is valuable. He has spent a lot of time on sea ice and is comfortable in the cold. He has filmed many successful documentaries, but also had some failures and embarrassments. Once, he couldn't identify the birds he was filming.

Recently, Doug went to Kong Karls Land in the Arctic Ocean to film a documentary about polar bears. It was a challenging assignment because the weather was very cold and the wind was strong. After 23 days of filming, he finally saw a mother bear and her cub. On the 24th day, he felt like he was living in a world of polar bears.

Pen Hadow is a brave explorer. In 2004, he was the first person to walk to the North Pole alone. He had to swim in very cold water and fight against frostbite and polar bears. Eight months later, he walked to the South Pole too. Now, he is going back to the North Pole again. This time, he will be with two friends and they will measure the ice to see how it's changing because of global warming.

Pen is very good at this kind of job. When he was a child, his father's old nanny taught him to be strong and brave. She would send him outside in the cold weather without many clothes on. Pen's father loved adventure and he passed this on to his son. Pen is married to Mary, who is also brave and loves the outdoors. She helps him with his work and is worried about him when he's away.

Pen has two children and it's hard for him to be away from them. He made a mistake last time and said something that made his son feel responsible for his sister and mother. This time, he won't talk to them as much so they don't feel sad. He is very careful about his equipment and is going with two other experienced explorers. They will take measurements of the ice and send the information to scientists.

Pen believes that his work is important because it helps us understand what's happening in the Arctic. He wants to show people how the ice is changing and what we can do to help. He's proud to be an explorer and knows that his skills are important for this job.<|eot_id|>"

It would cost a lot of money, £70,000, and I would have to stop working for a while. As a retired athlete, I usually make money by speaking at business events. But I wanted to do something new and exciting. Rowing across the Atlantic would be a big challenge, and it would be something I could talk about afterwards.

I was worried about people thinking I was only doing it for TV, but Ben was a good person to do it with. He had done some tough things before, like running a long distance in the desert and spending a year on a desert island. But he didn't know much about rowing. I had to teach him some things, and he had to work hard to get better. I learned that this race is not just about being strong, but also about being mentally tough.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

I left my job in London and went to work with huskies in Finland. I was 26 years old and wanted a change from the noise and crowds. I found a small company that took tourists on dog sled rides in the Arctic Circle. They had six dogs at first, but soon had over 100. I could stay for three months, but they warned me that the work would be hard and the conditions would be tough.

I took a plane to Finland and saw many pictures of huskies on the flight. I was supposed to learn their names, but I was too busy looking out the window. I saw the landscape changing as winter came. I arrived at the farm at night and was given boots and told to go outside. It was cold!

I met the other people working there and we went to the dog sheds. The dogs were excited and barking loudly. We had to harness them to the sleds and go for a ride. It was dark, but we had head torches. After a few days, I learned how to drive the sled and take care of the dogs. It was hard work, but I was happy.

I had to learn new skills, like chopping wood and using tools. It was cold and snowy, and everything took longer because of the weather. But I was proud of myself for learning new things. I could even use an axe and hammer now!

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Paula Radcliffe was a famous runner. She ran a very fast marathon one day. The press came to talk to her about it. They asked her about a special oil called emu oil. This oil helped her heal from an injury she got when she accidentally ran into a bike while training. 

Paula said she didn't think about how great she did that day. She just did what she wanted to do. Her coach and her team said they wouldn't set any limits for her. They wanted her to do her best.

During the race, Paula's coach and physiotherapist were worried she was going too fast. They thought she might get tired and stop. But Paula was strong and kept going. She finished the race in a very good time.

After the race, people asked her how she was able to run so fast. Paula said it was because she trained very hard. She also said that many people are more talented than her, but she was able to push herself to do her best.

Paula's coach said she was very dedicated and worked very hard. He said she was the best athlete he had ever worked with. Paula said she didn't know it at the time, but that marathon was her best ever. She didn't run as fast again, but she inspired many women to start running long distances.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 level learner:

I made a cooking show called ""In Search of Perfection"". I was worried about how people would like it because it was different from other cooking shows. It wasn't just about cooking techniques, but also about history, nostalgia, and science. But I didn't need to worry. The show was a success and led to other projects, including a book.

I wrote several more books and TV shows, each one about a different journey. In the latest one, ""In Search of Total Perfection"", I travel around the world to meet people who are experts in their craft. They spend a lot of time trying to make things perfect. Perfection is a personal thing, and what one person thinks is perfect might not be the same for someone else.

When choosing the dishes for the show, it was hard to decide which ones to include. Some people might be upset if their favorite dish wasn't chosen. But we worked together to come up with a list that everyone could agree on.

I didn't want to claim that the recipes in the book were the only way to make something perfect. Instead, I wanted to show how different people have their own ideas of perfection and how they achieve it. The book is about trying out new ideas and making them better and better.

In the show, I visited many places and met many people. I saw how food is made and learned new techniques. I even got to try some unusual things, like making ice cream from cow's milk and cooking chicken in a special machine.<|eot_id|>"

We were on a long drive to Marrakech when our van broke down in a field. John got out to look at the engine. He looked very serious and didn't want to be disturbed. After a while, he said, 'I don't know what I'm doing.' My mum and sister started laughing. My sister was worried because we couldn't stay in the field forever. The field was very big and had lots of flowers, like poppies and daisies.

John went to find someone who knew about cars. My mum and sister lay down on the grass and told me to tell them a story. I told them about two birds I heard talking in London before we left. I told them what the birds were saying. But my sister didn't believe me and said I was lying.

Later, John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to a hotel. My sister didn't want to get out of the van, but the boys were nice and waved at her through the window. We went into the hotel café and had some sweet tea made from mint leaves. My mum said it was like syrup!

We stayed at the café all day while John tried to fix the van. In the evening, we went to sleep in the hotel garden. The next day, John said we would have to tow the van to Marrakech. We sat in a truck watching our van being pulled behind us. My sister didn't want to move at first, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she was sitting in the front with the driver. I was worried about how we would get home, but I fell asleep.

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at a party in a big hotel ballroom. They were from Tokyo and a European city. Lucy didn't quite hear their names, but they were both good at English. They talked about the music they were playing and where they had been recently.

Lucy said she was going to a big music festival called Tanglewood. The man from Tokyo was surprised. 'How old are you?' he asked. Lucy said she was 15. The other woman was surprised too. Lucy didn't mean to brag, but it can be hard to know when to share information and when to be quiet.

Lucy's grandfather came over and took her away from the conversation. 'Don't get too friendly with the other pianists,' he said. Lucy didn't think they were competition, but her grandfather said everyone is the competition. He made her talk to important people at the party.

After the party, Lucy's grandfather said he was proud of her. He said people know who she is and think she's good. Lucy liked that. She liked being important, even if some people were jealous or didn't respect her because she's a concert pianist. But in places like this, she knows she matters.

Here is a simplified version of the reading passage for an A2 learner:

'My dad says I spend too much time online and I should get out more. But I wanted to know what experts think about social media. Most teenagers who use social media have many friends, a good sense of who they are, and learn important skills. Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says social media is a normal part of modern life for teenagers. It's like hanging out with friends at a youth club, but online.

Jim Matthews, a social media expert, says social media helps teenagers develop their identity and learn to deal with problems and make friends. Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says social media can help you figure out who you are and what you like. It's like posting about your favorite music or sports and seeing what others think.

Professor Andrew Phillips says social media can be helpful for shy people or those with special interests. You can connect with others who like the same things as you. Pauline White, an expert on digital education, says social media is becoming a powerful tool for creativity. Teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about things they're interested in. This can help them in their future jobs.

Experts agree that social media is an important part of life in the 21st century. It's not just about chatting with friends, but also about learning new skills and being creative. Teenagers who use social media in a positive way will benefit when they grow up and enter the workforce.'

When most people think of a holiday, they usually don't think of a big road trip across nine American states and one Canadian province. But my parents wanted to do something different. They planned a big adventure for our summer vacation. My dad seemed to want to make my twin brother and me go on the worst family trip ever. ""Not many people do this anymore,"" my parents said. But I was excited, even though I would miss my alone time for two weeks.

We packed our car with suitcases, food, and clothes for different weather. I was a bit worried about being away from home for so long, but I had some ideas to make it easier. We set off on our ""Family Road Trip"" and drove west. We saw many new things and had some exciting experiences. We stopped in Oklahoma and saw the stars in the sky. The next day, we drove again and saw mountains. We visited a place with big sand dunes and a town with a strong smell of sulfur. We also saw ancient and modern things together.

We had to be careful on the roads because of construction and animals. We saw many wind farms and went to Yellowstone National Park. We saw bears and had to wait in traffic to let them cross the road. We also had a close encounter with a bear and a park ranger. We stayed in a old hotel with no internet or phone. It was hard, but we enjoyed the beautiful views. After a storm, we went back home. My parents were right - you don't need to go to a foreign country to have a great adventure. It was nice to be home again, and I didn't fight with my brother too much on our long trip! We took many photos and I will remember the unexpected things we did.<|eot_id|>"

Amy will finish her school year with the help of the college head, who will take care of her. Rose will live with her grandmother, Daisy, instead. Rose doesn't know her grandfather, and she hasn't seen her grandmother in a long time. Her parents didn't want her to live with Daisy at first, but Daisy insisted.

Rose is excited to live with her grandmother. Daisy is a social person who likes to invite people to dinner and go shopping. Rose's parents talked to her before she moved and said she can have some freedom. She can play her music loud, invite friends over, and go out without asking permission every time. Daisy agreed to trust her and let her make her own decisions. Rose's mother gave her a new phone with a camera, and they all agreed to trust each other.

Rose has never been in trouble at school and has good grades. She will start at a new school in five weeks and will make new friends. This will be her fourth school in five years, but she is happy because it's her last two years at school.<|eot_id|>"

Charlotte Grainger wrote a book when she was 15 years old. Her teacher thought she might write a book when she was older, maybe 30 or 40. Charlotte didn't think that was a good idea. She wanted to try writing a book now. Her book is about to be published. It's a big achievement. The story is exciting and well-written.

I met Charlotte in her publisher's office. I was surprised to see a 15-year-old girl there. Charlotte is a strong and clever person. She knows that being young can be a limitation, but she doesn't think it's a problem. She wants to write about important themes, like taking responsibility.

Charlotte doesn't like books that show teenagers as outsiders or people who don't know much about the world. She wants to write about people who are normal and okay. She thinks some writers make teenagers feel like they're not good enough because they're not experienced. Charlotte doesn't agree with that.

Charlotte likes reading fantasy books, but some of them made her feel like she couldn't write a good book. She likes a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which says that if readers can guess what will happen, the story is boring.

Charlotte's parents are journalists, and they helped her get her book published. She thinks she was lucky, but she also worked hard. Charlotte says that writers need support and a little luck, but after that, they have to work hard to be good.

We went to a special ski training centre in the US. Our instructor, Gareth, told us to focus on speed. He said, ""Speed is your friend, not your enemy."" One of our group, David, went first. He tried a big jump, but he didn't do it well. He fell and lost his skis. Gareth reminded us that speed can be unpredictable.

I wasn't very good at freestyle skiing. I had tried it before, but only in a small way. I thought it was fun, but I wasn't sure if I was good enough. At the training centre, we practiced on trampolines and small jumps. It was hard to control my movements and land safely. Gareth told us to focus on our ""aerial awareness,"" which means knowing what our bodies are doing while we are in the air.

It took me a few tries, but eventually I landed safely from a jump. I was very proud of myself. But then, on my last run of the day, I didn't slow down enough before the jump and lost my skis. I realized that I still had a lot to learn.

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You're a little scared, but you're also excited. The rollercoaster goes up and down, round and round. It's a lot of fun, but it can also be a bit scary. Many people like to ride rollercoasters because they like the thrill and excitement.

But did you know that building rollercoasters is a big job? It takes a lot of experts to design and build them. These experts are called engineers and designers. They work together to make sure the rollercoaster is safe and fun.

One of the biggest challenges is making sure the rollercoaster is exciting but not too scary. The designers have to balance the thrill of the ride with the safety of the riders. They also have to make sure the ride is new and exciting, so people will want to ride it again.

I talked to three experts who design rollercoasters. They told me that the key is to make the ride feel exciting but not too scary. They have to swap between fast and slow, up and down, to make it feel like you're flying. It's a fine line between thrilling and scary.

The designers also have to create a story for the ride, like a space adventure or a jungle chase. They use new technology, like the tallest ride or the steepest drop, to make the ride exciting. But in the end, it's all about using their experience and trying out the ride to make sure it's perfect.

One of the experts said that you need to be a bit of a thrill-seeker to design rollercoasters. You have to understand what people want from a ride and test it before it opens to the public. Another expert said that even with new technology like virtual reality, the physical rollercoaster experience will always be the best.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Miranda Ellington is a 25-year-old choreographer who has already worked with many theaters and dance companies. She still likes to dance sometimes. I'm curious to know why she does both jobs. She says that dancing reminds her of when she was a dancer and had to follow the choreographer's orders. As a choreographer, she likes teaching young dancers. They are more open to new ideas and willing to take risks. They don't know what they're good at or bad at, so they listen to feedback and try to improve.

When Miranda works with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. She tries to find a good dance routine for every piece of music, even if she doesn't like it. If the dancers don't like the music, she has to find a solution. She would like to be able to choose the music, but usually, it's already chosen.

Miranda doesn't like to work with just one company. She likes to meet new people and work with different companies. Each company has its own way of working, so she has to adapt. She doesn't like to do the same thing every time.

I mention a documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda says it's a realistic show that shows what it's really like to be a dancer or choreographer. She says it's hard work and dedication.

I ask Miranda what makes a good ballet or dance production. She says it's when everything comes together - the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. It's not always perfect, but trying to be good is important.

I ask Miranda if she's a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist. She says people like to put labels on things, but she doesn't want to be limited to one type of dance. She wants to try new things and learn more.

I have a friend who asked me why I like to travel when I can watch things on TV. I said that TV can show amazing things, but why stay at home when there's so much to see and experience? This idea made me think of a crazy trip I took with a special goal: to get people to stop watching TV. 

My friend was getting rid of his old sofa, and I thought it would be a great idea to take it on a trip. I fixed the wheels and cables and wore seatbelts on my shoulders. I put my luggage on the sofa and slept on it each night, even on the beach one night. Some friends joined me and helped me pull the sofa along. It was a new and exciting experience for me. 

I've walked a lot before, but this was the longest and most unusual trip. I could stop at cafes and rest on the sofa while having a coffee, unlike when I'm walking on a rock and the wind blows away my food.

I read about group swimming trips in the sea around some small Greek islands. I was excited to try something new. My brother was busy, so I decided to join a group. When I asked for a ferry ticket, the man at the port looked surprised. I told him I was joining a group of 10 people to swim around the islands. He smiled and showed me to the boat.

Before we set off, we exchanged emails, but we didn't have time to talk much. Our guides explained that a support boat would be with us the whole time and showed us how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to split into groups, and then we did a longer swim of 1.5 km. I was a bit nervous because I hadn't swum that far before. The waves got bigger, and I was swimming with the slow group. I wanted to finish the swim, and I was happy when I did it on my own.

The next days were the same: we jumped in the water, swam at a comfortable pace, and stopped to look at the beautiful scenery. As we swam farther, I got faster and happier. I didn't need the support boat as much. I'm already looking forward to going again next year.

I don't think being a flight attendant is easy, but I love my job. I've been to many countries, including the US and Australia. I work with nice people, have a lot of free time, and never get bored. This is a great job for someone my age.

When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I had to fly alone, and sometimes I would help the flight attendants serve meals to passengers. This made me happy. Years later, I left my old job and wanted to find a new one. I saw an ad for flight attendants and decided to apply. Many people were applying, but I got the job!

At the summer camp, I like seeing the children do things they never thought they could do. Most of them know how to swim and play table tennis, but rock climbing is new for many of them. Some children are a bit scared, but after we encourage them, they try and everyone makes it to the top. This makes them very happy.

Some children miss their homes at first, especially the ten- to thirteen-year-olds. We don't let them use their phones all the time. We say they can phone home after lunch, and then later, we tell them it's too late to call now, but they can try again tomorrow. Most children get used to it after a couple of days and have a great time at the end of the week. They even thank us for it!

It's not just the children who feel lonely. Sometimes parents call us too much, asking how their child is doing. But often their child is busy playing or doing something else, so we ask them to call back later. We also get children who wear fancy clothes. They don't like it when we tell them to change into something more comfortable, but they understand why soon.

A new musical show called Rock the Planet opened in London. It's a special show where the actors are also very good musicians. The show was popular in the USA, where it won 'Best Musical' four times. But making the show in the UK was a bit tricky. The UK has rules about how many shows young actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. So, they needed twice as many actors in the UK. Luckily, they found many talented actors in the UK. The show is very popular in London and has been full every night. People love the songs that were popular in America.

I met a young actor named Jamie, who is 11 years old. He's one of the actors in the show. He said it's great that he gets paid to play music, especially on his beautiful guitar. He told me that the young actors are very busy. They have school lessons every day at the theatre, but Jamie misses his old friends. The show is very popular with schools, and Jamie's whole class came to see it. They loved it, and Jamie felt proud.

I also play guitar, so Jamie let me play with him and the other actors. We played a song called 'Days'. Jamie showed me how to play it, and I was happy when I got it right. Jamie is very good at playing the guitar. I was impressed and wished I could play as well as him. The young actors are all musicians, but none of them had played in a band before. They found it easy to learn, but the hard part was looking happy and natural when they first performed together. They were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile! The show will be in London for another year, and it's worth seeing.<|eot_id|>"
