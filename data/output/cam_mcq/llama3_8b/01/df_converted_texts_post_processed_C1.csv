Some time ago, a website highlighted the risks of sharing our whereabouts online. The website's point was that by sharing our location, we're also sharing our movements with many people we may not want to meet. This idea fits with the growing awareness that the internet has both positive and negative effects. The internet offers many opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, but it also has its risks.
In the early days of the internet, a group of pioneers explored these risks and learned from their experiences. They shared their thoughts, photos, and stories online, and many of them faced challenges and consequences. These pioneers, who are now known as bloggers, have already navigated the dangers of the internet and can serve as a guide for the rest of us.
One of these pioneers is Justin Hall, who started posting online in 1994. He shared his life, including his personal thoughts and photos, and his website became popular. However, he faced challenges when he started writing about his personal life, including a romantic relationship. His partner asked him to stop blogging or end the relationship, and he chose to stop blogging.
Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, had a similar experience. She wrote about her job and her colleagues, but an anonymous colleague shared her blog with her bosses, and she lost her job. This experience is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they wouldn't say in person. However, the internet is not a separate reality where we can say anything without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and we must be careful about what we share.
Heather Armstrong eventually restarted her blog and focused on her family. She learned that while the internet allows us to share our thoughts and experiences, we should be mindful of the consequences of our actions. We should remember that the internet is a powerful tool that can have a significant impact on our lives."

A few years ago, some scientists started warning people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? The film uses a mix of documentary and drama to show that there's a lot we don't understand about the universe. This is not a new idea, as scientists can't claim to know everything. However, some scientists felt strongly enough to issue public warnings, describing the film as ""atrocious"" or ""dangerous"". This sparked my curiosity, and I decided to watch the film.
At first, I didn't see what all the fuss was about. Scientists were simply saying that new discoveries were showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. But when the film discussed some of these discoveries, I began to understand the excitement. For example, it talked about how water molecules can be affected by thought. I had heard of a Japanese researcher who found that the shape of a water molecule can change just by the thoughts of people around it. The film showed pictures of ice crystals that looked nice when someone happy was talking to them and nasty when someone in a bad mood was talking to them. Many people find this idea fascinating and compelling, but scientists are more skeptical.
The film's claims are indeed amazing, but they need more evidence to be convincing. The problem is that the film's evidence was not strong enough. The film's claims about water molecules are impressive, but we need more proof that the effect is real. The real issue is that the film's claims are not extreme enough. In reality, scientists have found that the universe is even stranger than the film claims. For example, they have discovered that the universe is made up of an unknown form of matter and is being propelled by a mysterious force called ""dark energy"". On a smaller scale, neuroscientists have found that our perception of events is delayed by half a second, which is edited out by our brains. Anthropologists have also found the birthplace of modern humans and how they left it to populate the world. Some scientists even think they have found links between the existence of life on Earth and the design of the universe.
Despite what some people might think, science is not complete. In fact, we are further away from knowing everything than ever. The concepts of chaos and quantum uncertainty have shown that we can never know everything. This has led some of the world's leading physicists to try to create a single equation that sums up all the forces and particles of the universe. Many of us believe that the universe is best summed up in one word: incredible."

Writing novels is a challenging task, but writing short stories is a joy. It's like comparing planting a forest to planting a garden. Both processes are important, and they complement each other. When I finish a novel, I often want to write some short stories. After completing a group of short stories, I feel like focusing on a novel. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and I never write a novel while working on short stories. This is because writing novels and short stories engage different parts of my brain, and it takes time to switch between them.
I started writing short stories in 1984, and it was a new experience for me. I felt that my writing possibilities expanded, and readers appreciated this new side of me as a writer. One of my early short stories, 'Breaking Waves', was included in my first collection of short stories, Tales from Abroad.
Writing short stories is appealing because they don't take as long to finish as novels. It usually takes me about a week to get a short story into shape, although revisions can be endless. With short stories, I can create a story from a small idea, a word, or an image. It's like jazz improvisation, and the story takes me where it wants to go. Another advantage is that I don't have to worry about failing. Even experienced writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write masterpieces. I find this comforting, as I can learn from my mistakes and use them in my next story.
For me, short stories are like an experimental laboratory for my novels. They allow me to try out new ideas and techniques without the pressure of writing a novel. Without short stories, I would find writing novels even more difficult and demanding. My short stories are like footprints I've left behind, and I remember exactly where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these intimate feelings with my readers."

Science is a complex and multifaceted field that has both fascinated and puzzled humans for centuries. It has the power to cure diseases, improve our daily lives, and even threaten our very existence. Scientists have made incredible discoveries, from understanding the tiny atoms to the vastness of the universe. However, this progress has not been without its challenges and controversies. Established theories have been repeatedly challenged and replaced, and scientists have often clashed over their interpretations.
Science is a constantly evolving field, and its beauty is not always immediately apparent. It requires a deep understanding of complex concepts and a willingness to question and doubt. Despite its limitations, science has the power to change the world, and its impact on society is undeniable.
In the past, science has been characterized by conflict and competition. Scientists have often disagreed on the best approach, and their discoveries have sometimes been met with skepticism or even ridicule. However, these challenges have ultimately led to breakthroughs and a deeper understanding of the world.
Today, science is not just about discovering new facts; it is also about shaping the future. Scientists are working to develop new technologies and solve some of the world's most pressing problems. As a result, it is essential for non-scientists to stay informed about the latest developments and their potential impact on our lives.
In conclusion, science is a dynamic and complex field that has the power to transform our understanding of the world and our place in it. It is a journey that requires patience, persistence, and a willingness to adapt and learn. As we move forward, it is crucial that we recognize the importance of science and its role in shaping our future."

For several years, ebook sales grew rapidly. However, from around 2015, major publishers reported a decline in ebook sales or even a complete stop in some cases. This led to doubts about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some publishing executives admitted that the hype surrounding ebooks might have led to unwise investments, causing them to lose faith in the power of printed books. Despite the fact that digital and print books can coexist, the question of whether ebooks will 'kill' print books still sparks debate.
The idea of a medium replacing another is not new. In the past, critics predicted the demise of radio with the advent of television, and of books with the introduction of audiobooks. But in each case, the old medium found new uses and survived. The same is true for print books, which have adapted to new technologies and continue to thrive.
The idea of the death of the book is not just about ebooks; it's also about our emotional attachment to media. We form strong bonds with objects like books, TVs, and computers, and when a new technology emerges, it disrupts our relationship with the old one. As a result, we often romanticize the past and seek out retro products or older technologies.
The spread of the printing press, the shift from silent to sound movies, and the transition from analog to digital photography are all examples of this phenomenon. The emergence of e-readers has sparked a new appreciation for the tactile qualities of printed books, including their smell.
While the idea of the disappearing book might be alarming, it's also a reflection of our fascination with technology and our fear of change. We use familiar narratives, such as stories of tragedy and loss, to make sense of these changes and to express our emotions. The story of the death of the book is a way to explore our hopes and fears about innovation and transformation."

For 18 months, I started my day at 5:30 am, brushed my teeth, made some coffee, and sat down to write about how famous people throughout history managed their daily routines. I wanted to explore how they found time to do their best work, how they organized their days to be creative and productive. By looking at the everyday habits of these people, I hoped to gain a new perspective on their personalities and careers. As the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat and whether you take a nap, and I'll tell you how creative you are.""
My book is about the habits and routines of creative people, not just their work. It's about how they make time for their art and how they prioritize their daily tasks. It's also personal, as I struggle with the same issues in my own life. For example, how do you balance creative work with earning a living? Is it better to focus on one project or work on multiple things at once? When you have too much to do, do you have to sacrifice something, or can you find ways to work more efficiently?
I don't claim to have all the answers, but I've tried to provide examples of how successful and talented people have handled these challenges. I wanted to show how their daily routines influenced their work and vice versa. The title of my book is ""Daily Rituals,"" but I focused on people's routines and habits. A routine can be ordinary, but it can also be a powerful tool for achieving your goals. The psychologist William James believed that having a routine can free up your mind to focus on more important things.
I actually got the idea for this book because I was procrastinating on a writing task one Sunday afternoon. Instead of working, I was tidying my office and making coffee. As a morning person, I'm more focused in the mornings, but I'm not very productive in the afternoons. I started searching the internet for information on other writers' schedules and found it fascinating. I decided to create a blog to collect these stories and eventually turned it into this book. The book is based on my blog, but it's more extensive and better researched. I've tried to let my subjects speak for themselves, using quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. I've also included summaries of their routines from secondary sources. I want to thank the many researchers and scholars whose work I drew upon to make this book possible. You can find a list of my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide for further reading."

In recent years, there has been a significant shift in the way students approach research in higher education. The idea is to involve students in research as early as possible in their studies. This is because research is not just for famous scholars or experts in a particular field. It's a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills will be useful not only in your studies but also in your future career. As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions and finding answers.
Research is about asking questions like ""Why?"", ""How?"", ""When?"", and ""What if?"" instead of just accepting what you're told. You need to think critically and question what you read or hear. This is because knowledge is not fixed and can be challenged.
In higher education, you're expected to think critically and construct your own knowledge. This can be daunting, but it's an important part of learning. You need to engage with what you read, think about it, and test it out. You should also question whether what you're being told is logical, reasonable, and backed by evidence.
You've probably already been doing some research without realizing it. For example, when you're planning a holiday or trying to fix something, you're using research skills. These skills will help you in your studies and future career.

Cities have long been a hub of intellectual activity. From 18th-century coffeehouses in London, where people gathered to discuss chemistry and politics, to modern-day cafes in Paris, where artist Pablo Picasso shared his thoughts on modern art. However, city life is not always easy. The same cafes that sparked discussions also spread diseases like cholera, and Picasso eventually left the city for the countryside. The modern city is a place of creativity, but it's also overwhelming and unnatural.
Scientists have started to study how cities affect our brains, and the results are surprising. While it's well-known that city life can be exhausting, research suggests that cities actually make us less intelligent. One of the main reasons is the lack of nature. Studies have shown that patients in hospitals recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief glimpses of nature improve brain performance because they give our minds a break from the urban grind.
This research comes at a time when most people live in cities. Instead of living in wide-open spaces, we're crowded into concrete jungles with millions of strangers. In recent years, it's become clear that our unnatural surroundings have important effects on our mental and physical health. They can even change how we think.
Imagine walking down a busy street: you need to pay attention to pedestrians, traffic, and the confusing urban layout. This constant mental effort leaves us feeling drained. Cities are so full of stimuli that our brains need to constantly redirect our attention. This process requires energy and effort, like a powerful computer processing information. Natural settings, on the other hand, don't require as much mental effort.
This idea is called attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan. He hypothesized that being in nature could have a restorative effect on our minds. Natural settings capture our attention, but they don't trigger negative emotions like a police siren. Our mental machinery can relax and replenish itself.
Philosophers and landscape architects have long warned about the effects of city life and sought ways to integrate nature into modern life. Urban parks like Central Park in New York allow people to escape the city. A well-designed park can improve brain function within minutes. While people have searched for ways to improve cognitive performance, it seems that simply taking a walk in nature is one of the most effective methods.
Given the mental problems caused by city life, the question remains: Why do cities continue to grow? And why do they remain hubs of intellectual life? Research shows that the same urban features that trigger lapses in attention and memory – crowded streets and close proximity to others – also contribute to innovation. The concentration of social interactions is responsible for urban creativity. Just as crowded London led to intellectual breakthroughs in the past, crowded Cambridge, Massachusetts, contributes to its success as a creative center today. The key is to find ways to mitigate the psychological damage of the city while maintaining its unique benefits."

Where should we look for the mind? It's a question that may seem strange: isn't thinking inside our heads? We use advanced techniques to study the brain, but I think it's wrong to stop there. There's a lot of evidence from the past to the present that shows objects and things are part of our thinking and learning. From an archaeological perspective, it's clear that objects like stones, jewelry, and written symbols played a crucial role in human evolution and the development of the human mind. This means that what's outside our heads may not be outside our minds.
It's easy to understand why people think the mind is just the brain. Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people in isolation, away from the objects they normally use. This makes sense for scientists who use brain-scanning machines, but it overlooks the fact that much of our thinking happens outside our heads.
I'm not questioning the importance of the brain, but I'm suggesting that the mind is more than just the brain. Instead, I propose that human intelligence extends beyond our bodies into the world around us. This is the idea behind my Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET explores how objects become part of our thinking and learning, like when we make numbers and symbols out of clay or use a stone to create a tool. It also looks at how this has changed over time and what it means for how we think.
Think of a blind person using a stick. Where does their self begin? The stick is an extension of their body, and they use it to feel their environment. This shows that our minds are capable of reorganizing themselves in response to new tools and technology. My approach sees the human mind as an ongoing project, constantly evolving.
It's essential to remember that, whether it's a stone tool or the internet, our primary goal is to use these tools to understand and navigate the world. This unique human ability to engage with material culture explains why we make things and how those things shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – our minds are capable of changing and developing as they interact with the world. MET offers a new way to understand how different objects, from ancient tools to modern technology, have helped shape our minds and our understanding of ourselves.
The idea of mind-changing technology may sound futuristic, but humans have been using it since the earliest days of our species."
