Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at level B2:

Some years ago, a website warned about the dangers of sharing our whereabouts online. The site pointed out that when we post about our location, we're not just telling friends and family, but also strangers who may not be people we'd like to meet. This highlights the potential downsides of sharing our lives online. The internet offers many opportunities to share our thoughts, photos, and stories with a global audience, but it also comes with risks. We may share too much and regret it later.

However, there are people who have already navigated these challenges. The first bloggers, who started sharing their lives online in the early days of the internet, have already learned valuable lessons. One of these pioneers is Justin Hall, a student who began posting about his life on the internet in 1994. He shared his thoughts, photos, and art, and his blog became popular. But when he started writing about his personal life, he faced problems. His blog was shut down, and he lost friends.

Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, had a similar experience. She wrote about her job and her personal life, but her anonymous colleagues discovered her blog and shared it with her bosses. She lost her job as a result. This phenomenon is known as the ""online distribution effect,"" where we feel we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and offline lives are connected, and we must be careful what we share.

Heather Armstrong eventually learned to manage her online presence and now writes about her family life. Her story shows that we can learn from our mistakes and find a balance between sharing our lives online and protecting ourselves.

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of level B2:

Some scientists were worried about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? It's a mix of documentary and drama that shows how little we know about the universe. Most scientists agree that there's still a lot to discover, but some were concerned about the film's claims. The film says that scientists are finding out that the universe is much stranger than we thought. For example, it says that water molecules can be affected by our thoughts. This sounds amazing, but some scientists were sceptical. They said that the evidence wasn't strong enough. The film showed some pictures of ice crystals that looked nice when someone was happy and nasty when someone was in a bad mood. This might seem convincing to some people, but scientists want more proof. 

The film also talks about some real discoveries that scientists have made. For example, they have found out that the universe is made up of a type of matter that we don't understand, and that it's being propelled by a mysterious force called ""dark energy"". Scientists have also found out that our brains take a little time to process what's happening around us, and that we can't always understand everything about the world. 

In fact, scientists are still trying to figure out many things about the universe. They are working on a theory that will explain everything in the universe, but it's a big challenge. Some people think that the universe is amazing and incredible, and that's a good way to sum it up.

Here is the rewritten text at a level B2:

Writing novels is a challenge, while writing short stories is a joy. It's like comparing planting a forest to planting a garden. Both processes are important and help me grow as a writer. When I finish a novel, I often feel like writing some short stories. After completing a group of short stories, I might feel like focusing on a novel again. I never work on short stories while writing a novel, and vice versa. This is because the two types of writing require different skills and mental focus. I've been writing novels and short stories for a long time, and I've found that switching between the two helps me stay creative.

I started writing short stories in the 1980s, and it was a new experience for me. At first, it was challenging, but I enjoyed the process and felt it helped me grow as a writer. One of my early short stories, 'Breaking Waves', was included in my first collection of short stories, Tales from Abroad. Writing short stories is faster and less demanding than writing novels. I can usually finish a short story in a week, although revisions can take longer. Writing short stories is like taking a break from the long process of writing a novel. It's a chance to experiment and try new things.

One of the best things about writing short stories is that you can create a story from almost anything - an idea, a word, an image. It's like improvising jazz, and the story can take you in unexpected directions. Another advantage is that you don't have to worry about failing. Even experienced writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write masterpieces. I find this reassuring. You can learn from your mistakes and use them to improve your next story. In fact, I often use my short stories as a way to experiment and learn new techniques that I can apply to my novels.

My short stories are like memories that I've left behind. I remember exactly where I wrote each one and how I felt when I did. They are like guideposts to my heart, and I'm happy to share them with my readers.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Reduced the use of metaphors and similes to make them more accessible to B2 level learners.
* Simplified sentence structures and vocabulary to improve readability.
* Removed some complex phrases and sentences to make the text more concise.
* Changed some technical terms related to writing, such as ""fictional world"" and ""jazz improvisation"", to make them more understandable for non-native speakers.

Science is a powerful tool that can both help and harm us. It has made our lives easier and more comfortable, but it has also raised many questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it. Scientists have made many important discoveries, but they have also faced many challenges and disagreements. The history of science is marked by conflicts between different ideas and theories, and scientists have often had to overcome strong opposition to their ideas.

Despite these challenges, science has made great progress, and it continues to shape our understanding of the world. In the past, scientists were mainly concerned with understanding the natural world, but today they are also trying to manipulate it to suit their needs. This raises important questions about the responsibility that comes with scientific knowledge and the potential consequences of scientific discoveries.

As we move forward, it is essential that we understand the power of science and its impact on our lives. We must be aware of the benefits and risks of scientific progress and work together to ensure that it is used for the greater good.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level B2:

From around 2015, the sales of ebooks started to slow down or even decrease in some cases. This raised doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people think that the hype around ebooks might have led to poor investments, and some companies have lost faith in the power of printed books. Despite this, the idea that ebooks will replace print books still sparks debate. This debate is not just about ebooks and print books, but also about how we react to change and new technologies. 

The idea that one medium will replace another is not new. Before digital technologies, people predicted the end of radio, movies, and television. But these new technologies did not replace the old ones; instead, they found new uses. For example, people started listening to the radio in cars, during train rides, and on factory floors. 

The idea of the disappearing book is also not new. As early as 1894, people predicted that the invention of the phonograph would replace books with audiobooks. But books survived, and people continued to read them. This pattern of predicting the end of one medium and the rise of another has happened many times throughout history.

When new technologies emerge, we form emotional bonds with them, just like we do with objects like books, televisions, and computers. When a new technology replaces an old one, we feel a sense of loss and nostalgia for what we used to know. This is why we often develop industries around retro products and older technologies.

The spread of the printing press, for example, made people appreciate original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies stimulated nostalgia for the older form. The same happened with the shift from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. When e-readers emerged, people started appreciating the material quality of old books and even their smell.

This should reassure those who worry about the disappearance of print books. However, the idea of the disappearing medium will continue to provide a narrative about the transformative power of technology and our fear of change. We use familiar narrative patterns, such as stories of tragedy and ending, to make sense of change. The story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for what's new and our fear of losing parts of our world and ourselves.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a rewritten version of the text, simplified for a level B2 reader:

For 18 months, I woke up every weekday at 5:30 am. I brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and sat down to write about how famous people throughout history managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By sharing the small details of their daily lives, I hoped to provide a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers. The French chef Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap."" This book is about the daily habits of creative people, not just their work. It's about how they organized their time and schedules.

My own struggles with balancing creative work and earning a living inspired this book. I wanted to explore how people with busy lives managed to find time for their passions. Can you devote yourself fully to a project or set aside a small portion of each day? When there's not enough time, do you have to give up something or learn to work more efficiently? I don't claim to have the answers, but I've collected examples of how successful and talented people have dealt with these challenges.

The book's title is Daily Rituals, but I focused on people's routines. Routines are often seen as ordinary and unimportant, but they can be a powerful tool for making the most of our limited time, energy, and motivation. A good routine can help you stay focused and avoid distractions.

This book was inspired by my own procrastination. One Sunday afternoon, I was supposed to write a story, but instead, I spent the day tidying my office and making coffee. I realized that many writers have unusual working habits, and I started researching their schedules. This led me to create a blog and eventually, this book. I've collected a wide range of examples from biographies, articles, and interviews, and tried to let my subjects speak for themselves. I hope this book will inspire readers to find their own daily routines that work for them.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B2:

Howard became interested in palaeontology when he was six years old. His family couldn't afford a holiday in Spain, so they went to the English coast instead. On the beach, Howard found an ammonite, a fossilized shell. This sparked his interest in the field. As he grew older, Howard became more focused on the early days of life on Earth. He was particularly fascinated by the tiny creatures that lived on the surface of rocks. After completing his university studies, Howard faced the challenge of finding a job. He applied for a position at Tavistock College in London, but wasn't sure if he would get it. The day of the interview, the professor who was supposed to chair the panel had an argument with his wife and ended up in the hospital. The interview went ahead without him, and Howard was surprised to find out that he got the job. Later, a colleague explained to him that the professor who replaced him had a personal agenda and had chosen Howard for the position. Howard was relieved that he got the job, even if it wasn't exactly how he had hoped.

Years later, Howard's briefcase containing his lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. He reported the theft and postponed his lecture. While waiting for a new briefcase, he met a colleague who was hosting a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that had been acquired, but not yet cataloged or identified. This discovery presented Howard with his greatest challenge and ensured his professional future. If the thief hadn't stolen his briefcase, Howard might not have discovered this opportunity.

Charles Spence, a professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, is known for his unusual eating habits. He has tried foods like bee larvae ice cream, which has a nutty, floral flavor. Spence and his team study how our senses work together to create the taste and smell of food. They have found that many things can affect what we eat and drink, such as the company we're with, the way food is presented, and even the background noise.

Spence has written a book about his research, called The Perfect Meal. He has discovered some surprising things, like the fact that the person who orders first in a restaurant usually enjoys their food the most. He has also found that we eat more food when we're with others - up to 75% more when we're with three people.

Spence's lab is not high-tech, but he is able to work with cooks and chefs to create new and interesting foods. He is funded by a large food company and works with them to create healthier foods. For example, he has helped some companies reduce the amount of salt and sugar in their products. He believes that this is a good way to make people healthier.

Spence has also worked with famous chefs, like Heston Blumenthal, to create new and unusual dishes. He has discovered that the sounds we hear while eating can affect the taste of food. For example, higher-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched music can make it taste bitter.

Spence's research is being used in many different ways, from restaurants to airlines. He has even created a smartphone app that plays music to match the taste of food. At home, Spence and his family like to have fun with food, too. They have had dinner parties with unusual foods and sounds, like rabbit with fur wrapped around the cutlery and light bulbs that change color.

Here is the simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of level B2 on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR):

Our brains are busier than ever. We're constantly bombarded with information, both true and false, and we need to sift through it all to find what's important. At the same time, we're doing more tasks on our own. Thirty years ago, travel agents and salespeople helped us with our daily tasks. Now, we do most things ourselves. We're juggling multiple tasks while trying to keep up with our personal and professional lives, and our smartphones are always by our side.

However, our brains are not designed to multitask efficiently. When we think we're doing multiple tasks at once, we're actually switching between them quickly, which can be costly in terms of mental effort. This means we're not as productive as we think we are. Multitasking can also lead to increased stress and decreased focus.

In fact, research shows that multitasking can reduce our intelligence quotient (IQ) by almost 10 points. It can also make it harder to learn new information and make good decisions. When we're constantly switching between tasks, our brains are working harder than usual, which can lead to mental fatigue.

The constant stream of emails can be overwhelming. We feel pressured to respond to each one, but it's hard to find the time to do so without getting bogged down. As a result, we may end up doing multiple tasks at once, which can be detrimental to our productivity and overall well-being.

In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino had a strange habit. Every night, he would break up concrete into small pieces and throw them at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other bats that are having trouble giving birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought animals just behaved in certain ways and that was it. But now, scientists are studying animal emotions and moral values. This has led to a debate about whether animals can think and feel like humans do.

Recently, scientists have discovered that animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens have emotions. This has sparked a debate about whether animals have a moral sense, like humans do. In one experiment, cows were given a task to open a gate to get food. Those that could open the gate themselves seemed to enjoy it more than those that had it opened for them. Does this mean that cows like problem-solving? If so, what does it mean for the way we treat them?

Some experts think that this research means we should stop eating meat. Others believe we should rethink how we view animal intelligence. One expert says we should stop assuming animals think like us. The debate is not just about science or morality, but about philosophy. Can we ever really know what it's like to be an animal?

In one study, starlings were kept in different conditions. Some had nice cages, while others had small, bare cages. The birds that had nice cages were more likely to eat even when the food was not good. This suggests that being in a bad environment can make animals pessimistic. Some experts believe that animals can get depressed, just like humans do. Others disagree. The debate is complex and contentious, and it's hard to know what to think.

'Critical thinking is a way to understand and analyze what we read or listen to. Adrian West, a researcher, believes that argument is a way to find the truth. While technology can help us process information and learn, it can also make it harder to think deeply. We are exposed to more information and opinions, which can be overwhelming. This can lead to poor thinking and a lack of critical thinking. According to the National Endowment for the Arts, people are reading less, and this might be affecting their ability to think critically. Some experts think that the focus on visual media, like video games and TV, is making it harder for people to focus on one thing and think deeply. However, technology can also be used in a way that promotes critical thinking. For example, some video games can teach decision-making and analytical skills. It's important to understand how technology affects our thinking and analysis, especially as reading and math scores are declining.'

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic who used to work in an office. He wrote a book about the benefits of manual trades and another one about how to cope with modern life. He was inspired to write this second book when he noticed that advertisements started appearing on credit card machines while he was waiting. He realized that our attention is being constantly demanded and it's becoming harder to focus on what's important.

We're being bombarded with information and representations of the world, such as video games and apps, which often try to manipulate us. This is making it harder to have real conversations with people and to focus on what we want to do. Crawford thinks that we're losing something fundamental in our society by only interacting with representations of people and not with real people themselves.

He believes that we need to find ways to engage with the world in a more satisfying way. He suggests that we need to regulate noise and distractions in public spaces and develop skills that allow us to interact with the world in a more meaningful way. For example, a cook, an ice-hockey player, or a motorbike racer all have to deal with real-world challenges and make judgments about what's important. This helps them develop skills that can't be replicated by manufactured experiences.

Crawford thinks that constantly resisting distractions can be exhausting and makes it harder to focus on what matters. Instead, practicing attention and focus can make it easier to pay attention to others and find what's important.

Here is the simplified text for a level B2 learner:

'What do you do for a living?' is a common question, and we usually answer it with a few words. However, when you're a philosopher, it's a bit harder. Saying you're a philosopher can sound pretentious, as if you're claiming to have some special knowledge that others don't. But philosophers are just ordinary people who think deeply about life.

One reason people think philosophers are special is that they often talk about big ideas and judge what others do. Ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle and Socrates believed that thinking deeply about life was the most important thing. This idea has stuck, and many people still think that philosophers are wise and above the rest.

But philosophy isn't just about being wise; it's about thinking carefully about the world and our place in it. Socrates said that a life without thinking is not worth living, because it means we're just following what others do without questioning it. This means we need to think about our own lives and what we believe in.

Philosophers don't need to be experts in complicated theories or read lots of books. They just need to think about the everyday things that matter to us. This is important because it helps us make our own decisions and live the way we want to.

However, many philosophers today are disconnected from everyday life. They write for other experts and don't share their ideas with others. This makes it hard for people without a background in philosophy to understand what they're talking about. We need to change this and make philosophy more accessible to everyone.

I often call myself an ethicist because I work on ethics, which is the part of philosophy that deals with what's right and wrong. But I think this title is too narrow, as it implies that ethics is just about following rules. In reality, ethics is about thinking deeply about how we live and what we value. It's not just about whether something is right or wrong, but also about why we think it's right or wrong.

Philosophy can help us understand ourselves and the world better. It can help us see that our beliefs might not be as clear-cut as we think, and that's okay. By thinking deeply about our lives, we can make better choices and live more thoughtfully.'

I have made the following changes to simplify the text:

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B2:

Food lovers and chefs might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, philosophers have not usually focused on food in their discussions. When they have talked about eating, it's often been as a metaphor for something else, like learning. Some philosophical conversations seem to be about food, but they're actually exploring other ideas. Interestingly, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus believed in pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain, but he applied this to many areas of life, not just eating. Today, his name is often associated with enjoying food and drink, and is used in the names of restaurants and recipe websites. This suggests that people want to be seen as approving of philosophers' ideas. Food is a social and cultural activity. The food we eat comes from historical contexts and is shared with our communities. These communities provide us with friends and family to share meals with, as well as the systems that grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more ways than with any other commodity, making it a natural topic for philosophical discussion.

Once food is prepared, people start talking and writing about it. But why do food critics get to have such a big influence? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill, but rather that good food critics are just better at describing what they taste. In fact, this is an area that has been neglected, as philosophers have not paid much attention to the way our senses work.

Food is also an aesthetic experience. We talk about beautiful paintings or music, but not the taste of food. Some philosophers argue that, with the rise of modern cooking, food has earned its place in discussions of beauty, alongside sculpture or poetry. However, food is destroyed when we eat it, which is not the case with visual or auditory art. Aesthetic objects should last over time, so it's not fair to consider food a true work of art.

There are many ethical questions surrounding food. For example, we might ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or genetically modified? The answers will often reveal our values. Philosophers will also ask why these answers are what they are, and this debate is justified.

Cooking at home and in restaurants is another issue. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests, driven by their relationships of love and friendship. In the home kitchen, everyone is included, and we come together to share food and companionship. Restaurant cooks, on the other hand, have obligations to their employers and the food itself. This means their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are with colleagues, not friends.

A recent essay, 'Diplomacy of the Dish', explores how food and dining can bring people together across cultures. This happens in two ways. First, we can learn to appreciate other cultures by enjoying their food. Second, we can form personal bonds with people from other cultures by sharing meals together, a practice with a long history in international diplomacy. The essay is filled with interesting examples and anecdotes, making it accessible to a general audience and bringing to life the idea that food can be a key part of philosophy.<|eot_id|>"

Rob Daviau, an American game designer, wanted to create more exciting board games. He thought that traditional games were no longer challenging or interesting. He wondered if games could have a storyline and if decisions made in one game could affect the next one. He created a new version of the classic game Risk, called Risk Legacy. In this game, players' decisions had a permanent impact. They might have to tear up cards or damage the board. The game is played over several sessions, and players can see how their actions affect the game.

Daviau was asked to work on a legacy version of the popular cooperative game Pandemic. His next project was a game called SeaFall. In this game, players are sailors exploring the world in the 16th to 19th centuries. The game designers have to think about all the possible choices players can make to ensure the story doesn't fall apart. They test the game with players to see how it unfolds.

Daviau didn't expect the legacy format to become popular. He thought it would be a niche idea. But many players loved the concept. They liked the idea of an unfolding adventure and the commitment to playing the game over several sessions. The legacy format has also been compared to video games and TV series. The game designers see it as a way to tell a story and create a sense of ownership.

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the National Aquarium in New Zealand. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This is a story that sounds like something from a children's movie and was widely shared online. People enjoy stories about animals, especially octopuses, because they are so intelligent and different from humans. Octopuses can open jars, recognize faces, and even play. Some people think it's fun to imagine that animals are like humans, but a scientist named Dr. Frans de Waal argues that it's actually the opposite - we often underestimate the intelligence of animals.

Dr. de Waal has studied primates like gorillas and chimpanzees for many years. He says that animals can do many things that were once thought to be unique to humans, such as thinking about the past and future, feeling empathy, and understanding what others are thinking. Animals are much smarter than we often give them credit for.

In the past, people thought that animals were intelligent and could even be put on trial for crimes. Even Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, believed that the difference between human and animal intelligence is one of degree, not kind.

However, in the 20th century, the idea of behaviorism became popular, which focused on teaching animals through rewards and punishments. This led people to view animals as either machines that respond to stimuli or as animals with useful instincts. Anyone who thought that animals had internal thoughts and feelings was seen as romantic or unscientific.

But Dr. de Waal believes that we are now starting to recognize that animals are intelligent and have their own way of thinking. He thinks that the best way to test animal intelligence is to design tests that take into account the animal's unique abilities and characteristics. For example, squirrels are great at remembering where they hide their food, while humans need apps to find their phones.

In his book, naturalist Sy Montgomery writes that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might ask us to change the color patterns on our skin. Since we can't do that, the octopus might conclude that we are not very intelligent.

Dr. de Waal is skeptical about Inky's escape, but he knows that stories like this can help people appreciate the intelligence of animals. He even ran an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys can feel envy. The monkeys were given either cucumbers or grapes as rewards, and those who got the cucumbers became angry and jealous when they saw their peers getting the better treat. The study was published in a scientific journal, but it was the one-minute video clip that really convinced people of the findings.

'Robotics is a rapidly growing field that is expected to have a profound impact on the way we live and work. While robots have been used in manufacturing and the automotive industry for some time, experts predict that they will soon be used in many other areas, including healthcare, education, and even our homes. This could lead to significant changes in the way we work and live. Many people believe that robots will take over most jobs currently done by humans within the next 50 years, but surprisingly, most people also think that their current jobs will remain unchanged. However, this is unlikely to be the case. Every industry will be affected by robotics in the next few years. For example, a robot in Australia can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, a task that would take two human bricklayers a day or more to complete. Another example is a robot that roams supermarket aisles to ensure that goods are properly stocked and priced.

Experts argue that while robots can't yet service or program themselves, this will create new job opportunities for technicians and programmers. However, others warn that we should not underestimate the importance of human skills in the workplace. World expert Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, research director for IDC, believes that society is not prepared for the impact of robots on our daily lives. According to his report, within two years, almost one-third of robots will be able to work alongside humans safely and efficiently. Within five years, many companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will have developed laws to regulate robots. Despite this, there will be a shortage of skilled workers in the robotics industry, leading to a rise in salaries. Dr. Zhang emphasizes the need for people to retrain and adapt to the changing job market. He also predicts that robots will become more common in our daily lives, interacting with us in new and sophisticated ways.

This shift towards robotics poses significant challenges, including the need for new laws and regulations to ensure our safety and privacy. With millions of jobs at risk, it is crucial that we focus on education to prepare for the future of work. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to remain competitive in the job market.'<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted to a level B2 reading proficiency:

'Why do people climb mountains? George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once said, 'Because it's there.' This answer might seem simple, but it's actually a reminder that sometimes we climb just for the adventure and fun. Climbing can be a thrilling experience, but it's not always easy. Climbers face many challenges, like bad weather and difficult terrain. Despite these challenges, many people love climbing because it gives them a sense of freedom and excitement.

Some climbers see climbing as a game, with its own set of rules and strategies. They choose how to climb, depending on the type of climb and the risks involved. Others believe that climbing helps them develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. Climbing can also teach us to be more self-reliant and committed to our goals.

Some climbers prefer to climb alone, without the help of others or technology. They believe that this makes their achievements more meaningful and challenging. Others see climbing as a way to connect with nature and find inner peace. They enjoy the physical and mental challenge of climbing, as well as the sense of accomplishment when they reach the top.

In the end, people climb for many different reasons. Some climb for adventure, others for personal growth, and others for the sense of freedom and excitement. Whatever the reason, climbing can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience.'

Here is the rewritten text, simplified for a learner of level B2:

For over 60 years, pianist Alfred Brendel has been a dominant figure in classical music. He is an intelligent and serious person who has explored and recorded many famous piano pieces. Brendel wrote and performed a lot, but he rarely taught. Those who knew him well saw a playful side to his personality, but this was not often shown in his concerts. He had a strict routine of studying, traveling, and performing. Then, about four or five years ago, a young boy named Kit Armstrong appeared backstage at one of Brendel's concerts and asked for lessons. Initially, Brendel didn't take the request seriously. He had only a few students and didn't see the need to take on more. However, there was something about the young boy that caught his attention. Kit was 14 years old at the time and played the piano remarkably well, even by heart. Brendel was impressed by Kit's performance and decided to make time for him. As Brendel is retiring from the public eye, Kit is starting to make a name for himself - with Brendel's careful guidance, as he is always worried about the young man burning out too quickly. Kit is a restless and impatient person who is always learning new languages, studying math, writing computer code, and playing tennis. He also composes music. Brendel believes that learning to read music properly is helped by trying to write music yourself. He noticed that Kit has a phenomenal memory and is a great sight reader. Kit is also very sensitive to sound and can listen to his own playing and make changes. Brendel is careful not to raise Kit's expectations too high, as he believes that some young musicians can play certain pieces well, but not others. At 80 years old, Brendel is enjoying his post-performance years and still has many ideas for music he wants to play. He doesn't play anymore, but he is happy to have a new career as a teacher.

I never thought of gardens as anything less than perfect places when I was a child. My grandfather's garden was special because it was near a river and had a gentle slope down to the water. You couldn't see the river, but you could hear the sound of the water and the birds singing in the trees. I thought all gardens were like this - a peaceful escape. My grandfather's garden wasn't very different from others in terms of features. He didn't have a fancy greenhouse like some of his neighbors, who made their own greenhouses from old windows. My father was a quiet and reserved person. He wasn't boring, though - he loved silly things and had funny phrases he used, like ""It's immaterial to me."" Deep down, he was probably disappointed that he hadn't achieved more in life. He left school without qualifications and became an apprentice plumber, which wasn't his passion. He wasn't ambitious, but he had a moment when he and my mother considered moving to Canada. However, it didn't happen. At home, he was great at fixing things, like bookshelves or cupboards. My parents moved house only once, but my mother loved buying new furniture. I was surprised when a piano arrived, but it intimidated me. The only thing I liked about it were the two brass candlesticks that stuck out. My mother said they were too fancy, so they disappeared while I was at school. I never got to play the piano, but my sister did. When I asked my mother why I wasn't allowed to play, she just said, ""You wouldn't have practiced."" I always preferred the river to the moors or woods. Along the river, I could use my imagination and escape into another world. I'd walk along the riverbank, looking for a spot to take off my sandals and leave them with my picnic while I went fishing. After a few failed attempts to keep the fish alive, I gave up. I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father announced that there was an opening for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I was excited, and my father seemed to think it might be a good opportunity for me. He might have preferred it if I became a carpenter, but I like to think he saw my passion for gardening and wanted me to pursue it.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B2:

Lawrence MacEwen is standing on his island, the Isle of Muck, in Scotland. I'm standing next to him. A strong wind is blowing, making it difficult to stay on our feet. But MacEwen is comfortable here. He strokes his sheepdog, Tie, and points to the surrounding islands. He tells me that the one to the north is Eigg, and the one to the west is Rum, which gets twice as much rain as Muck.

We start walking down the hill, and MacEwen shows me more about the island. He explains that Muck is a small volcanic island, and that his family has lived here for 3000 years. We stop to move some sheep, and MacEwen gives instructions to his dog, Tie. The dog doesn't listen, and MacEwen is disappointed.

The Isle of Muck is a family business. Lawrence and his wife, Jenny, run the farm. Their son, Colin, manages the island cottages, and their daughter, Mary, runs the hotel with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby like that their boys can play freely on the island and sail boats in the summer.

Life on the island has its challenges. There is no electricity all the time, and no mobile phone signal. But we adapt to it. I even stopped using my phone after a couple of days. One evening, I had breakfast by torchlight, and Mary told me that most people get used to it.

The island is full of surprises. One day, a boat arrives with groceries and three musicians who play a concert in the tearoom. Everyone enjoys the music. In the evening, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. Her father bought a farm on the island without seeing it first, and Jenny was sent to manage it. She had good typing skills.

I go to bed listening to the rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, and most of my food comes from the island. I go fishing with Sandy Mathers and bring back fresh fish for Mary. We have a delicious dinner, and then I wait for my ferry to take me to the next island. But there's a chance that my ferry might not come because of high seas. If that happens, I might have to stay on Muck for a few more days, which would be nice, but I'm not sure.<|eot_id|>"

The video game design industry used to be a niche field, dominated by computer scientists and self-taught individuals. However, it is now gaining recognition as a legitimate profession. Industry experts agree that it's challenging to break into the industry, but it's expanding and needs more skilled professionals. Jim Donelly, a representative from an online games magazine, emphasizes the importance of hands-on experience: ""To get ahead in the industry, you need to make games. The tools are available, and without creating something, you won't get a job or succeed independently.""

John Field, another industry expert, agrees that making games is crucial, but also highlights the need for a combination of skills, including creative talent, technical knowledge, and entrepreneurial ability. He suggests that a postgraduate course in game design can be beneficial, as it provides guidance and support. Many game designers start their careers as programmers or artists and work their way up the ladder.

John also emphasizes the importance of networking and connections in the industry. He notes that games are no longer just for adolescents, but are now a popular form of entertainment for people of all ages. With the rise of smartphones and social media, the opportunities in the industry are vast and expanding.

'I've always loved playing football. My dad encouraged me to play, but it wasn't forced on me. I had a friend who was pushed to play by his dad, and he eventually gave up. I'm glad it wasn't like that for me. When I score a goal from far away, people often say it's just luck, but it's not. I've practiced my shots since I was a kid. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also work hard. When I teach kids, I try to make them enjoy learning new skills. I was involved in many sports at school, but football was my passion. I want my son to have a good education, but I also want him to enjoy learning. We're already reading to him, even though he's too young to sit still for long. I hope he doesn't develop the same passion for football as I did.

In my professional career, our manager didn't make a big deal about our promotion to the first team. We knew we had to work hard. Although I scored in our first game, we lost, and a TV presenter said we couldn't win with young players. That motivated us to work even harder. I rely on my close friends and family, but having a lot of money can also cause problems. Some people think I should support my parents financially, but I want them to be independent. I've helped them with some expenses, like paying off their mortgage and buying them a car. I think they would be offended if I made them dependent on me. I have a lot of money, but it doesn't solve all my problems. After I retire, I plan to take a break and do things I haven't had time for while playing. I want to go skiing as soon as I can.'

But when the weather got hot, people started coming. We had a lot of visitors, and my father was working hard to finish his script on time. I would often go to the beach with my dog, Rusty. We didn't have a dog when we first moved, but Rusty showed up and stayed. My father wasn't too happy about it at first, but Rusty won him over. Rusty loved the beach and would dig up things and bring them to me. Sometimes, he would find things that didn't belong to him, and I had to return them to their owners. Rusty also liked to swim and would always come with me, even though he wasn't very good at it. One day, my father left to deliver his script to Los Angeles, and Rusty and I spent the day swimming and playing on the beach. As the sun began to set, we sat and watched the surfers. One surfer in particular caught my eye - she was really good! She asked me why I didn't join them, and I said I didn't have a surfboard.

The queues were not moving, and an announcement came over the loudspeakers saying that the computer system had broken down. The atmosphere among the passengers became gloomy, with some people getting frustrated and others trying to stay calm. Violet was feeling anxious and decided to check her bag for her phone, but it was missing. This made her even more upset, as she needed it to contact the taxi company to check if she had left it behind. She couldn't borrow someone else's phone because all her numbers were stored in her own phone. A kind-looking couple behind her in the queue offered to let her use their phone, and she rang her son Harry to ask him to ask their neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was left behind. Violet was worried that she would be in trouble if she couldn't find her phone, as she needed it to access important numbers in New York. Eventually, the queues started moving, and Violet boarded the ship. She was disappointed by the ship's foyer, which looked like a cheap hotel.

Maloof was looking for pictures to use in a book about a neighbourhood in Chicago, but instead he found over 30,000 images taken by Maier. Since then, Maloof has gathered a large collection of Maier's work, including her cameras, film, prints, and negatives. He has also found many 8mm movies and audiotapes.

Maier was a nanny who worked in Chicago and took pictures of the people and streets she saw every day. She was a private person, but she loved taking pictures and would often go out with her camera and talk to people. Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon are trying to learn more about Maier's life and work. They have talked to people who knew her and looked at her pictures to understand what she was like.

Maier's pictures are very good and show the world in a unique way. She took many pictures of women, children, old people, and poor people. Photography expert Larry Silverman thinks that her pictures are very good and that she may have been influenced by other photographers.

Eleanor Catton's novel, The Luminaries, is a big and complex book. When people say it's ambitious, they usually mean it's a bit of a failure. But Catton's book is a huge success. I met her in the UK when her book was very popular. She was still young, but very calm. She told me a funny story about being stopped at the airport and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed the official her book and said it was about a murder mystery in New Zealand in the 1860s. The book is about a group of 12 men trying to solve some crimes. It's very complicated, but Catton wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good story. The book is over 800 pages long because of this.

When I asked her how it felt to be so successful at a young age, she said it was nice because everyone in New Zealand feels like they're all part of her success. She also said it's annoying when people think she's not trying to write something meaningful in her book. Catton wanted to write a book with a special structure. She wanted the book to get faster and faster as you read it. She didn't plan out the whole book beforehand; she just wrote herself into a tricky situation and then tried to find a way out.

I asked her if she wanted to write for TV or movies. She thought it could be fun. She loves TV shows with many characters and plot twists.

Jonny Kinkead has been making things with his hands for most of his life. As a boy, he loved playing with his dad's tools and making things in his garage. He also loved playing the guitar. In fact, he's been building acoustic guitars by hand for over 40 years. Jonny still gets excited about how two pieces of wood can come together to create a beautiful sound. He started playing guitar when he was 11 and then moved on to the bass guitar when he was 16. He built his first bass guitar from scratch, and it turned out well.

Jonny and his brothers used to make model boats and planes, so he was familiar with the process of building things. His dad taught him how to use various tools, and he even customized and repaired instruments for his friends. Although he built a good bass guitar, he didn't think about making a career out of it at the time. He was also interested in painting and sculpture.

After finishing school, Jonny studied architecture at university, but he dropped out halfway through. He realized that he was too individualistic and wanted to do something more creative. He thought that building guitars was a type of sculpture that involved creating sound, and he decided to pursue it.

For the first ten years, Jonny supplemented his income by cleaning windows part-time. He sold his guitars for the cost of the materials, but as he gained a reputation, he could charge more. Even now, he still only makes about ten guitars a year, which limits his earnings. To get known, he would attend music festivals and get musicians to try out his guitars and talk about him to their friends.

Jonny believes that it's easier for new guitar-makers in the UK today because people now recognize the quality of UK-made guitars. He thinks that taking courses can help, but also emphasizes the importance of trial and error. ""The thing to do is to look at other instruments, see where people have succeeded or failed, and try different things,"" he says.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B2:

When discussing English conversation, it's common to start with the weather. In fact, the famous diarist Dr. Johnson noted that when two English people meet, they usually talk about the weather. This observation is still true today. Many writers have tried to explain why English people are so interested in the weather, but they often start with the wrong assumption: they think that English people talk about the weather because they find it fascinating. However, this is not the case.

The American writer Bill Bryson, for example, points out that the English weather is not particularly exciting. Jeremy Paxman, a British broadcaster, disagrees, saying that the English are interested in the uncertainty of the weather. However, I believe that both of these views are missing the point.

Our conversations about the weather are not really about the weather at all. Instead, they are a way for English people to start conversations and show politeness. For example, saying ""Nice day, isn't it?"" or ""Ooh, isn't it cold?"" is not a genuine inquiry about the weather, but rather a way to break the ice and show friendliness. This is similar to the way monkeys and apes use grooming to bond with each other.

There are three specific situations in which English people use weather-speak: as a greeting, as a way to start a conversation, or as a filler when the conversation is lagging. As a result, it may seem like English people talk about the weather all the time, but in reality, it's just a way to be polite and show interest in others.<|eot_id|>"

'I'm excited about this,' Jonny said, as the brothers started the race. 'I've never done anything like this before, and it's going to be fun! The roads have beautiful views, and it's cold today, so I'll stay warm in the car.'

Alistair was also eager to start, but he was wearing special winter cycling gear. He wasn't worried about the cold, though. 'To be honest, I've seen Jonny drive before, so I'm not sure he'll make it. I might stop for a cup of tea halfway up.'

The race started at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and ended at Yorkshire's highest road, Fleet Moss, which is 350 meters high. Jonny was worried about the steep hill at the beginning, but Alistair was confident. 'I've seen Jonny drive before, so I'm not sure he'll make it. I might just stop for a cup of tea halfway up.'

The brothers started the race, and Alistair quickly got ahead. Jonny had to deal with a tractor on the road, while Alistair had to carry his bike up a steep hill. After a while, Alistair reached the top of the hill and started to ride again. Jonny, on the other hand, had to drive slowly because of the narrow roads and a stream on the road.

When I play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, I'm struck by the silence. The soft grass, the rich history, and the respectful crowds all combine to create a peaceful atmosphere. I find this silence helps me focus on my game. As a tennis player, I often struggle to shut out distractions and stay focused on the match. The silence of Centre Court is a blessing.

The only interruptions to the silence are the applause and cheers after each point. But even these sounds seem distant, as if they're coming from far away. I'm so focused on the match that I'm not aware of the thousands of people watching me or the millions around the world.

I've always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My coach, Uncle Toni, told me it was the biggest tournament of all. I've played here before, but lost to Roger Federer. In 2007, I was devastated by my loss. I felt like I had let myself down and wasted my chance. I was so upset that I cried for half an hour in the dressing room.

But my coach told me not to cry, that there would be other chances. He was right. I got another chance to play in the final the next year, in 2008. This time, I was more confident. I had learned from my mistakes and was determined to win. I was so focused that I didn't even think about the crowd or the millions watching me. I just focused on the match.

She spent most of her life in Africa, working as a scientist, journalist, and environmentalist. Goodall is famous for her research on chimpanzees. In 1963, a British organization published articles and documentaries about her work, making her a well-known figure. She wrote popular books, including a bestseller, and has been translated into many languages. Goodall is considered one of the most celebrated female scientists of the 20th century. However, her fame may have overshadowed her actual achievements. Many books and articles have been written about her, but they often focus on her personal story and achievements, rather than her scientific contributions.

Goodall's work has been groundbreaking. She discovered that chimpanzees eat meat, use tools, and have emotions and social systems similar to humans. Her book, 'The Chimpanzees of Gombe', is a leading reference in the field. Her long-term study of chimpanzees in Tanzania has been called one of the greatest scientific achievements of the Western world. Goodall's work has changed the way we study animals and think about ourselves.

From a young age, Goodall showed signs of her future career. When she was five, she crawled into a henhouse to observe how hens lay eggs. This curiosity and determination have driven her to become a renowned scientist.

Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist who can mimic different voices. She can sound like an 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an elderly Scottish woman, and even a fast-talking alien. She's worked on many projects, including children's TV shows and computerised training programs.

Shirley talks about what it takes to be a good voiceover artist. She says that many actors think they can do funny voices, but it's not just about that. You need to bring the script to life and make the audience feel like they're watching a real person. Many famous actors want to do voiceover work, but they often don't get the parts because they're used to acting on stage or screen.

Shirley started out as a drama student, but she discovered her talent for voiceovers by accident. She was asked to do a voiceover for a cartoon and ended up getting a major role. She found that she could do many different voices and that voiceover work might be her calling.

As an adult, Shirley is often asked to do voices for children. She's learned to create different sounds from the back of her throat and to avoid sounding like the same child all the time. She collects new voices by watching children's TV shows and cartoons.

Shirley's job is varied and includes educational videos, commercials, and even animation. She says that the key to success is to smile while you're talking, which makes your voice sound bright and cheerful. She also recommends investing in a good showreel, which is a recording that demonstrates what you can do.

Shirley believes that hard work and dedication are essential to success in the voiceover industry. She recommends attending specialist workshops and being passionate about human sound. She's obsessed with voices and loves becoming the characters she plays. Her children are used to hearing her talk in different voices and accents.

Many people ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's understandable, as it's a dream job that not many people achieve. Most people grow up and choose more practical careers, like being a lawyer or engineer. However, some people do make a living by drawing cartoons. I was one of them. I studied graphic design in college and started drawing illustrations. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted my work, and soon I was able to support myself. 

To become a cartoonist, you don't need a university degree, a lot of money, or even to be a great artist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. However, it's not an easy job. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication. If you're not passionate about it, it's better to choose a more stable job.

I've done many different types of cartoons, including political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also written, caricatured, and designed. The more skills you have, the more likely you are to make a living from your art. 

In the past, many cartoonists had regular jobs drawing cartoons for newspapers and magazines. However, nowadays, most cartoonists work freelance, which means they have to find their own clients and sell their work. If you're good at business, you'll do better than someone who is only good at drawing. 

Some people are worried that someone will steal their ideas, but it's easy to protect your work by adding a copyright symbol. In reality, it's more likely that no one will be interested in your work. If someone does steal your cartoon and it becomes popular, it can be a lucky break.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B2:

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and getting rid of old things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me on my 16th birthday. I didn't know why I wanted to get rid of it, but I did. I took it to the dump and was about to throw it away when a young man stopped me. He asked if I was really going to throw it away, and I said yes. He asked if he could have it, and I said okay. Later, I felt sad about giving it away.

Months later, I received an email from a guitar dealer who had found my old guitar. He had bought it from someone who had bought it from the man at the dump. He had found my name on a label on the back of the guitar and used it to find me online. He offered to sell it back to me, and I was overjoyed. I would have given him anything for it, but he was reasonable.

I had forgotten that my dad used to put his name and address on all my things, including my guitar. My parents had wanted me to learn classical guitar, but I couldn't make progress. So, I switched to the electric guitar and played simple music. When I took my old guitar out of the box, I remembered my birthday in 1978 when my parents gave it to me. Holding it again, it felt smooth and familiar. I picked it up and started playing, and my fingers knew what to do. I even felt the familiar pain of pressing the strings to play a chord.

The electric guitar is not usually played alone. Now that I'm playing again, I think I'll need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe there are other people my age who have had a similar experience. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!

Here is the simplified text for a level B2 learner:

There's been a lot of talk about sleep recently. When I wrote a book about people who can't sleep, I felt like I was warning people about the dangers of not sleeping enough. Sleep is very important for our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important it is. It's great that sleep is getting more attention. But I'm wondering about dreams. We don't talk about dreams as much as we should. When we wake up early, we often cut off the last hour or two of sleep, which is the stage when we have the most vivid dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in this stage, so over a lifetime, that's a lot of time spent dreaming. Researchers have found that when people are deprived of this stage, they make up for it the next night by having more dreams. This suggests that dreams are important. When researchers discovered this stage of sleep in 1953, they thought that interpreting dreams was the best way to understand how our minds work. However, this didn't turn out to be true. The focus shifted to the physical reasons behind dreams rather than the psychological ones. Today, there's not much agreement among researchers about dreams. But one thing is clear: dreams are important. A study found that people who are creative, such as actors, writers, and directors, are better at remembering and using their dreams. This makes sense, as creative people often need to think outside the box. But doesn't everyone need to think creatively? Teachers, software designers, and politicians all need to come up with new ideas. Dreams can help us make new connections and find new patterns. For example, researchers have found that when people are woken up during this stage of sleep and asked to think about a word, they come up with more original ideas than when they're woken up during other stages of sleep. This is what creativity is. I find that I write better when I wake up after a dream. Even a dream that's hard to remember can give me a boost of creativity. We all need our brains to be working fully, so we can think creatively and solve problems in our personal and professional lives.<|eot_id|>"

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small coastal town in southwest England. When you visit her studio, you'll see empty frames on the walls, surrounded by happy photos of her two daughters. It might seem strange that a renowned copyist artist, known for reproducing famous paintings with incredible accuracy, doesn't have any of her own work on display. ""I finish a piece and it goes,"" she says with a shrug. Susie is in high demand. Over the past 30 years, she has painted copies of famous works by Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh, among others. Her copies are so realistic that art experts often mistake them for the originals. While the originals could sell for millions, Susie's copies fetch anywhere from a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them. Susie won't reveal most of her clients, but they include galleries and private collectors. Some collectors buy her copies because they love art, while others do it to show off their status. Susie has even had famous people buy her copies, only to pass them off as originals. ""It's up to them,"" she says.

Susie believes that reproducing a masterpiece requires great skill and attention to detail. She makes sure her copies look authentic, but she always signs her name on the back of the canvas. Passing off a copy as an original is illegal, and Susie has never been tempted to do so. She knows that those who make fakes often end up in trouble.

Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She was paid very little, but the experience taught her the importance of accuracy and attention to detail. She stresses the importance of learning to draw and represent things accurately to young painters who approach her for advice. Susie's skills have allowed her to create perfect copies of 15th-century masterpieces, 20th-century abstract art, and even 16th-century Caravaggio portraits. She specializes in reproducing French impressionist paintings, with Manet, Cezanne, and Degas being her favorites.

Some people might wonder why Susie doesn't create her own original art. After all, isn't art about expressing oneself? Susie believes that her skills are the result of years of training and hard work, and she makes a good living from her copies. She has tried creating her own art, but it didn't turn out as well as she had hoped. Perhaps it's like trying to cook a meal after a lifetime of eating food cooked by a professional chef. The thing about Susie is that she's a perfectionist.<|eot_id|>"

Ellen MacArthur's passion was always the sea, and she loved racing on it. She spent most of her time on her boat, feeling a strong connection with it. After she finished her solo sailing trip around the world, she realized that her way of living was not sustainable. She started to think about the impact of human actions on the environment and the limited resources we have. She realized that we need to find a way to use these resources wisely and not waste them.

Ellen's experience as a sailor taught her the importance of planning and preparation. She believes that everyone should think about the consequences of their actions and make changes to live more sustainably. She has been traveling around the world, talking to people and sharing her ideas about how to reduce waste and use resources more efficiently. She also founded a charity, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, to help young people learn about sustainability and find ways to make a positive impact on the environment.

Ellen misses the adventure of sailing, but she believes that her new mission is more important. She wants to use her voice to inspire others to make a change and create a more sustainable future. She says that this new mission is more challenging and complex than her sailing achievements, but it is also more rewarding.

Here is the simplified text for a B2 level learner:

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to climb Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. If he succeeds, he will be one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Jordan hopes that his adventure will inspire other young people to spend more time outdoors and be more active. He is climbing with his parents, Paul and Karen, who are also experienced climbers. They are part of a team called ""Team Romero"".

Jordan's goal is not only to climb Everest but also to climb the highest mountains on each continent, a feat known as the Seven Summits. He has already climbed five of them and might achieve this goal before he turns 16. Some experienced climbers have expressed doubts about taking a 13-year-old up the world's highest mountain. They think that a young climber might not be emotionally strong enough for the challenge.

Jordan's parents have heard these concerns before and are taking steps to ensure their son's safety. They are experienced climbers themselves and believe that their own experience will help them navigate the risks. Jordan's father, Paul, says that they regularly discuss the risks and challenges with Jordan to make sure he remains motivated.

Jordan's motivation for climbing is to achieve his goal, and he doesn't seem to be worried about the risks. His father emphasizes that the project is not about seeking fame but about inspiring others to be more active and adventurous. Jordan knows that he has to play the media game to inspire others, which means sharing his experiences through blogging, photo shoots, and interviews.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a level B2 learner:

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, you can be sure it's not classical music they're listening to. Most of us know many pop groups, but ask your friends if they know who Brahms was, and they'll probably look puzzled. I'm studying music, but my classmates know as little about classical music as anyone else our age. If you don't know who wrote the music, you're unlikely to buy their recordings. The statistics are worrying for classical music lovers. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells only 300 copies. I find this hard to believe. So, what's caused the decline in interest in a type of music that has been around for centuries? Some people blame our obsession with TV and video games, but I don't think that's the main reason. The truth is that classical music just doesn't appeal to most people, especially teenagers. Now, I know some teenagers who love classical music, but they're a minority. As a musician, I play in an orchestra, but I'm not a big fan of classical music myself. I enjoy many different types of music, but my computer shows that my classical music listening is probably similar to that 3% figure. So, why don't teenagers like classical music? Well, first, the pace and rhythm of classical music are difficult for us. We like to talk fast, play fast, and think fast. Additionally, we have trouble paying attention for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical music pieces but perfect for a pop song. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music requires time and concentration. Pop music also deals with issues that are more relevant to teenagers. The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would make music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Nowadays, you can find any music you want online, and classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. Have you ever been to a shop that played classical music in the background? My teacher says that classical concerts have become more popular in recent years, but I doubt many of those new audience members are teenagers. In my orchestra, we play classical music in different places, but the crowd is usually made up of older people. I don't know why people become more interested in classical music in middle age, but I do know that if your parents like something, you're less likely to be interested in it as a teenager. Some people blame our schools for the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers, but there are many kids who love playing classical music in their school orchestra. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. Classical music appeals to them when they perform, but it's not their favorite music otherwise. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, it's usually pop music we listen to.

Bonnie Wyndham got out of her mother's car and looked at Almonside School. 'I'll make you sorry I've come here,' she said, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the other door and didn't hear. Bonnie wouldn't have cared if she had. Her mother knew how she felt. Mrs. Wyndham looked around and saw that Almonside School was a bit unusual, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside. Then she saw signs with names like 'Science block', 'gymnasium', and 'riding centre'. Bonnie noticed the riding centre and became interested. 'That's where the horses are,' she said. Her mother showed her the way to the headmaster's office. Bonnie followed her, but then she decided to explore on her own. She walked to the riding centre and saw some nice old buildings and a big indoor riding arena. There were no people around, but Bonnie knew how to treat horses with respect. She walked along the stalls, looking at each horse and judging its quality. 'I know what they're doing here,' she told a small pony. She liked the horses and thought they were well taken care of. She found a brown horse with a touch of white and liked its lively look. 'You're the best of the lot!' she said. She stroked the horse's neck and felt like she knew it from somewhere. She remembered a dream where she rode this horse to victory in a competition. The horse's name was Maverick, and Bonnie couldn't resist the temptation to ride it. She found a bridle and saddle and put them on Maverick. When she sat on his back, she felt like a queen. She laughed, remembering her nickname 'Queen Bee' from her old school. 'You're the best horse I've ever sat on, Maverick,' she said. 'We could be great friends if I stay here.'

So, how did a laid-back surfer guy end up performing in front of thousands of fans? Cody started playing the guitar at six and writing songs at seven. However, he was also a keen swimmer and surfer, and these activities took up most of his time. When he was 13, he posted some videos online, and they became very popular. People asked for more videos, so he started recording at home. The response was overwhelming. Cody was a talented swimmer and was training hard, but then record labels approached him and he had to make a difficult decision: stay in Australia and continue swimming or take a risk and sign a deal to move to the US with his family. Cody decided to take the risk. 'It was hard for me to choose a career at such a young age,' he says. He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the US. 'It was a big surprise to most people,' he says. 'I'm a quiet person and I think it's important to stay humble in this industry.' Cody packed his bags and moved to the US with his family, giving up one dream to pursue another. Although his family keeps a low profile, they are always there to support him. Cody knows that success comes from taking risks and saying 'yes' to opportunities. 'It all happened very quickly and unexpectedly,' he says.

I woke up early, got out of bed, and looked out the window. The river was frozen, but there was a small crack in the ice where the sunlight was shining through.

I had worked hard all week with the other adults to get the job done. My grandfather didn't seem to notice or care.

As I got dressed, I looked out the window again and saw a boy on the other side of the river. He was trying to balance on a thin piece of ice near the warm water coming from the factory. I put on my wetsuit and jacket and grabbed my lucky chain, which my grandfather had given me. It was a special chain that only a few people knew about.

I went downstairs and said good morning to my mom, who was cooking breakfast. She reminded me to be careful and asked if I was going kayaking. I said yes and headed out the door. My grandfather came out of his room and scolded me for not watching where I was going. He asked me why I was going kayaking, and I told him. He said I didn't need to train because I didn't win the competition. I tried not to let his words hurt me and went downstairs again.

My mom was still cooking and told me not to mind my grandfather's mood. I said I would try to ignore him and headed out to the backyard to get my kayak.

Mum grabbed Jess's arm and pulled her into the study. On the table, there was a painting by Grandpa, but it was unlike anything he had done before. It was unfinished, but it was already beautiful. The painting showed a river, not a real one, but a fantasy river. The riverbank was almost invisible, but the eye was drawn to the pale waters and the hidden sea. There were no animals, no birds, no people. It felt right that way. Jess was captivated, thinking about the coming of autumn after a long, warm summer.

Mum said, 'It has a name.' But there was something in her voice that didn't sound right. Grandpa never gave his paintings names. Mum turned the painting over and showed Jess the words Grandpa had written: 'River Boy'. Jess read them aloud. The words seemed important, but she didn't know why.

Jess looked at Mum. 'There is no boy.' Mum said, 'Strange, isn't it? Maybe Grandpa will add the boy later.' Jess knew why Mum had asked Grandpa about the painting. She knew what his response would be. 'He said that the artist doesn't have to explain a painting because each picture has its own life and its own language. We either understand it or we don't.'

Mum laughed. 'I was hoping you might know something about this painting, since you seem to inspire him.' Jess knew what the word'muse' meant, but she had always thought it was just a myth. She didn't think she could inspire someone as stubborn as Grandpa.

Here is the rewritten text at a level B2 CEFR:

This morning, I accidentally cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I didn't plan to do it, but it could have happened if I had tripped over the bed with my father's knife. I'm not saying it did happen, but it could have. I didn't wake up thinking, ""Today, I'll cut a hole in my carpet."" It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Sometimes, we do things without thinking them through. This happens to me a lot.

I was actually trying to find a way to fit my corner cabinet into a corner. My grandmother gave it to me when she moved into a flat. It's a small, white cabinet with pink and blue flowers and tiny glass doors. She used to keep china ornaments in it. I keep my collection of shells, fossils, and stones there. My grandmother knew I loved the cabinet, so I was excited when she gave it to me.

The problem is that the cabinet is shaped like a triangle and needs to stand in a corner. I only have two corners in my bedroom, which is small and shaped like a wedge. My parents say that when my sister goes to university, my brother can have her room and I can have his. But since my sister is only 15, it seems like I'll be stuck in my small bedroom for a while. I don't mind; I like my cozy room. The only problem is the lack of corners. I tried fitting the cabinet into the angle between the roof and the floor, but it was a bit too tall. If I could only cut a few centimeters off the bottom, it would fit. That's when I thought, ""Why not cut a hole in the carpet?"" It seemed like a good idea at the time. My father would be proud of me because he always tells us to ""think outside the box."" And that's exactly what I did.

""The novel 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live in the walls and floors of a house. They 'borrow' things from the normal-sized people to survive. When I directed a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it would be challenging. Fans of the book have strong ideas about how it should be done. I used the original drawings from the book to guide my work. The author wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' perspective, not a human one. This made filming more complicated.

The most important thing was getting the scale right. The Borrowers are 10 times smaller than humans, so we had to film them from 10 times farther away than usual. When filming the human surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground to get the Borrowers' perspective. We developed a special technique to combine the images of the tiny Borrowers with the ordinary-sized surroundings.

One challenge was finding a way to get the shadows right. We built a permanent set for the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. The actors had to carry around giant items like scissors and coins, which made the crew laugh. In one scene, the Borrowers are swept down a drain, and the actors had to be swept down a tunnel with the hoses. They said it was a frightening experience, but they didn't have to act much.

I was careful with the costumes, making them out of heavy canvas material to make them look like dolls' clothes. This made it difficult for the actors to move around. The weather was hot during filming, and the actors didn't thank me for my attention to detail with those costumes.

Most of the action took place away from the Borrowers' home, so we filmed them in front of a blue screen on an empty set. It was challenging for the actors to react to things that weren't physically there. I drew pictures of every scene to show people how each one should look. The budget didn't allow for special effects studios, so I worked nights for three months to get it done. We had to work hard and fast, and sometimes I forgot to check if there was film in the camera. But it all came together in the end, and I think the series was successful in capturing the magic of the books.""

In the United States, being a teenager is not just about going to school. Teenage girls are expected to be good students, have a part-time job, volunteer, and excel in all these areas. Teenagers can't just blend in; they have to stand out. The pressure on them is enormous. They have a lot of homework, tests, and extracurricular activities, as well as jobs, chores, and responsibilities at home. They also need to maintain a social life.

Many people, including adults, forget how much pressure teenagers face. They have to balance their schoolwork, jobs, and personal lives. Some people think that teenagers are lazy, disrespectful, and self-absorbed. However, this is not entirely true. Many teenagers are hardworking and responsible.

Technology has made it easier for teenagers to stay connected and get things done. They can use their cellphones to do their homework, communicate with friends, and stay organized. This means they are always reachable and available. Many people assume that teenagers spend most of their time playing video games or watching TV, but this is not the case.

Teenagers have a lot on their plates. They often wake up early and stay up late, with little time for leisure activities. The US National Sleep Foundation found that most teenagers do not get enough sleep. Many teenagers fall asleep in class because they are tired. Despite the pressure, many teenagers find time to volunteer and help others.

One teenager, Lindamarie Olsen, thinks that the stereotype of teenagers being self-centered is wrong. She believes that many teenagers are interested in making a positive impact in their communities. In fact, she loves volunteering and finds it rewarding. Who knows what the stereotype of teenagers will be in 20 years, but one thing is certain: they will continue to surprise us and make a difference.

The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in and around Bishop, a mountain town in the US. They have launched over 50 balloons into space, which is a unique combination of science and adventure. I joined them on a weekend in late spring to see them launch a new balloon. Their goal was to record shooting stars, which are bright streaks of light that appear when a rock or piece of metal enters the Earth's atmosphere. To achieve this, they attached a camera, an altitude meter, and a thermometer to a lunch box and inflated it with a special gas. They then tracked the balloon as it rose into the sky, using GPS to locate it later.

As the balloon disappeared into the night, the students went home, but a few stayed to watch for shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountain and gazed at the incredibly clear sky. Unfortunately, the camera didn't capture any shooting stars, but the experience was still exciting. The students had to find the lunch box the next day, which was a challenge. They used the GPS to locate it, but it took them 11 hours to get there. The lunch box was stuck in a canyon, high on a rock, near a waterfall. Although they didn't get the results they wanted, they were happy to have had another adventure and to share their stories with others.

Chloe Morgan never thought much about science, let alone Palaeontology, until she was 15 years old. Her younger brother was going through a dinosaur phase, and she reluctantly helped him with a science project. When she read an article about recent discoveries in the field, she was amazed and knew she wanted to learn more.

Chloe remembers meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was very approachable and easy-going. She was nervous at first, but he showed her patience and willingness to listen. This experience encouraged her to pursue a career in Palaeontology.

She thinks that films like Jurassic Park have increased public interest in dinosaurs, but the way palaeontologists are depicted is often inaccurate. They are often shown as eccentric geniuses or geeky losers who can't relate to people.

In reality, Chloe's job is varied and involves digging up dinosaur bones, analyzing fossils, and writing scientific papers. She also spends time explaining scientific findings to the public and communicating with young people. She believes that science should be accessible to everyone and that talking about dinosaurs is a great way to get people interested in the natural world.

Chloe recently worked on a TV documentary, Walking with Dinosaurs, which was a great opportunity to influence how dinosaurs are portrayed on screen. She was happy to offer advice and check that the dinosaurs shown were accurate. She thinks that dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they speak to our sense of adventure and the desire to discover new things. They remind us that there is still more to learn and explore in the world.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B2:

When you're on a long car trip with your family, even as a child, you know that you're not there yet, even when you ask 'Are we there yet?' many times. But when you finally arrive, it's no longer 'there', it's 'here'. So, if you really think you're there, you should ask 'Are we here yet?' Instead of asking the same question over and over, think about how good you have it. You can watch your favourite DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while enjoying the view outside. Your parents will take care of everything, making sure everyone is comfortable. But, of course, there's always something that can ruin the trip. For example, if your sibling does something annoying, like putting their foot on your side of the seat. This can lead to a fight, and your parents will have to intervene. They'll tell your sibling to stay in their own seat and behave. After that, things might calm down, and you can even try to read a book. But sometimes, your sibling might find a way to make you angry again. For example, they might blow on your arm, making you feel annoyed. Your parents have developed ways to deal with this, like responding to 'Are we there yet?' with 'We're here. Get out of the car.' This can keep everyone quiet for a while. But when you finally arrive, you can tell because the grown-ups will get out of the car and go away from the kids who have been bothering them for hours. So, remember: if your parents are still near, the answer to your question is 'no, you're not there yet.'

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level B2:

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and board games. They want to bring people together and encourage social interaction in a world where everyone is busy with their phones and technology. The café focuses on 'Eurogames', which are board games with gentle themes, such as building and farming. These games are designed to be fun and engaging for all players.

The first Eurogame, 'The Settlers of Catan', was created by a German designer. Players build settlements and trade resources, making it a fun and interactive experience. Later, co-operative games were developed, where players work together as a team, promoting social interaction and teamwork.

Matt Leacock, a successful game designer, was inspired by a game called 'Lord of the Rings' and created 'Pandemic', a game where players work together to solve global problems. Leacock's passion for board games started when he was a child, but he was often disappointed with the games he played. He decided to design his own games with the help of his uncle, and 'Pandemic' became a huge success.

The growth of the video games industry has actually helped the popularity of board games. Many people who play video games are now open to playing board games, and the rise of mobile gaming has made it easier for people to play games together in the same room. John and Zuzi's café is a great example of this trend, as people come together to play games and socialize.

Jamie Scott is a successful music producer and writer. He believes that perseverance is key in the music industry, even when things don't go as planned at first. Jamie's mother was a great singer and encouraged him to play the guitar. He grew up listening to music from a local radio station that played older songs, which influenced his musical taste. Jamie started playing the piano at school and had to choose between tennis and music. He decided to focus on music because it was more enjoyable. At 17, he left school to pursue a career in music. He formed a duo with a friend, but they eventually went their separate ways. Jamie's parents gave him a deadline to make it as a performer, and if he didn't succeed, he would have to get a job. After a few near-misses with record labels, he was signed to a music publisher at 19. However, record labels wanted him to be a solo artist, so he had to split from his friend. Jamie eventually found success behind the scenes, writing songs for other artists. He believes that writing for others has been his greatest success. Jamie is proud of his ability to write catchy, popular songs and doesn't apologize for wanting to create hits. He thinks that writing songs that people love is the ultimate goal, and he's willing to work hard to achieve it.

Tony Connor is a famous street trials cyclist. He does amazing stunts on his bike, jumping from one difficult place to another. People record his stunts and put them online. I met Tony at a BMX park on a Saturday morning. Many people knew who he was and came to say hello. I was impressed by his bravery, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, he explains what he's going to do, and I'm often amazed that he can do it. Afterward, he seems unimpressed by my compliments and a bit downbeat. Despite being famous, Tony doesn't like the social side of being a celebrity. He prefers to focus on his riding rather than talking about it. He thinks that social media and camera technology have given people like him the opportunity to make a living doing what they love. However, he's not complaining. He's grateful for the chance to make a living from something he's passionate about.

Tony has a good attitude to failure. He doesn't get discouraged if he falls off his bike. He gets back up and tries again until he masters the stunt. Some people think he's reckless and takes unnecessary risks, but Tony says they don't understand the sport. He takes advice from experts to minimize the risks. He's aware of the dangers and knows that some people shouldn't be doing this kind of sport. Tony is in the group that feels fear but finds a way to overcome it. He plans and prepares carefully before attempting a new stunt and knows he can't lose his nerve just before jumping.

I've noticed that there are two important factors that make a good athlete: energy and the ability to overcome disappointment. These qualities are more important than talent and help athletes persist even when they fail.<|eot_id|>"

Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on many challenging charity projects. For her latest adventure, she walked on a thin metal wire 66 meters above the ground between two power station towers. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to another wire above. To stay balanced, she carried a heavy stick. Helen had some circus skills, but she soon realized that high-wire walking was very different. 'The training was tough,' she said. 'I didn't know how strong I'd need to be. Every day started with a run up a steep hill, followed by exercises and practice on the wire. I also learned how to fall onto the wire so I could keep going if I slipped. It was painful every time I fell, but it was important to stay positive. If I was nervous, the wire would shake too!' The day of the challenge was windy, but Helen controlled her nerves by taking deep breaths. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. 'That was the scariest thing I've done,' she admitted. 'I'm glad it's over!' Despite this, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by ski, kite, and bike.

In 2006, Jeff Somers started a journey around the world on a penny farthing, a special type of bicycle with one large and one small wheel. Jeff had already written a book about his experiences traveling around Canada in an old car. He loved motor sports and worked as an engine builder. To save money, Jeff rode his old bicycle to work and even used it for a holiday trip to Amsterdam. This experience opened his eyes and he decided to see the world by bike.

Jeff didn't want a regular touring bike, so he decided to build his own. He chose a penny farthing because it was the craziest bike he could think of. After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 due to a knee injury, Jeff finally set off in 2006. He traveled through 23 countries on four continents over three years. The highlight of his trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. Although he met cyclists who could ride up mountains, Jeff never regretted his choice of penny farthing. The more he traveled, the more amazed people were by his unusual bike. Jeff's worst moment was when he had to drink dirty water from a stream, which gave him a serious fever. He was bedridden for ten days without medicine and had no money to pay for medical bills or his return journey. Despite all this, Jeff says that if he could afford it, he would set off on his penny farthing again tomorrow.<|eot_id|>"

We're concerned about the black duck population decline and whether there's enough food for them on the east coast. While we know a lot about their daytime activities, we've never had the equipment to study their nighttime habits. The new scope will give us clear images, even on moonless nights, so we can learn more and make informed decisions about the area where they live. It's a challenging project. We're a team of four, working six hours a day. We've studied ducks in different locations, and I've had to take a boat to some sites to make notes on every duck I see. The weather hasn't been ideal - some nights are mild, but often it's wet. It's also very quiet, so I need a lot of coffee to stay awake! We've only missed one working day so far due to heavy snow. Despite the challenges, I enjoy the project, especially compared to the summer when we'll be stuck in a laboratory analyzing our findings.

I also taste the raw materials we use, such as nuts and fruit, to choose the best ones for our chocolate. I have a kitchen near my office where I can test and taste new products.

Have you ever wondered what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson works at Circus Experience, a center that teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it covers many skills, such as juggling, trapeze, and fire-throwing. On the year-long course, students gradually take more risks and parents attend some classes to see their progress. Sophia explains that to be successful in the circus, performers need to keep practicing and trying new things. It's also important to be fit and work well with others. Many circus performers set up their own businesses, and Sophia's course covers this too. However, she warns that it's not a job for making a lot of money.

However, the teacher didn't listen to her ideas, which made her write a song called ""Something to Say"". She posted the song online and it became very popular.

Last year, I went on a fantastic trip to the west coast of Canada. My brother Harry, who's also a journalist, suggested it. He wanted to write articles about the trip and is a boat enthusiast. I'd always been fascinated by the area since I saw it on TV as a child, and it's where our great-grandparents used to live before moving to Europe. I kept asking Harry if I could join him, and he finally agreed. Just before we left, there were bad storms in the area, but the forecast was good for the time we planned to be there. Harry took care of all the arrangements, so I didn't have to worry.

When we arrived in Canada, we met the group and set off on our small boats. The guide told us that few people live along that coast, and we only saw dolphins and birds on that first morning. We could see islands in the distance, but the fog made it hard to see far. I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water. We often stopped to explore the rock pools on the beaches, which were full of colourful fish I'd never seen before. It was great to be able to forget about time and just enjoy the moment. We made our own food over campfires for lunch and dinner. When we went to sleep on the boats at night, even though the beds were hard, it felt like a stress-free life.

When it was time to leave, I was sad to go back to my normal life. But I knew I'd miss my family and friends if I stayed. I was also looking forward to telling everyone about our adventures when I got back home.

It's hard to make decisions with so many beautiful options. If I was choosing for myself, I'd probably only pick pink flowers, as they're my favourite colour. But I have to remember that what I like and what customers want might not be the same. Sometimes we can't find the exact flowers customers want, as they're not always available. I'm not a fan of arguing with flower sellers about prices, but it's part of the job. Flowers aren't cheap, so I have to try to get the best price possible. Back at the shop, we prepare vases with the flowers I've bought and create bunches. We then calculate the cost of each order. Customers are often surprised by how expensive flowers are, and I sometimes have to ask them to reconsider what they want. Some people might think this is too much trouble, but I enjoy thinking about how I can create the nicest flowers for the amount of money someone is willing to spend.

Some places are even free, as the owners make money from snacks during the film. We're happy to cover our costs, not make a profit. Each time we show a film, things get easier. We have our own equipment now, and we know how many tickets we've sold online. People of all ages come to talk about the film afterwards, and it's great to see. Our website has been helpful, and we're in touch with other film clubs across the country. We've visited them to see how they do things, but it's always good to come back to our own club. We've also started a blog because most people look for film information online.

Many of my photos were black and white, which was different from what most other young photographers were doing. At times, I doubted my project and thought about giving up. But I trusted my feelings and became more confident about my style. My art teacher told me about a national photography competition for young people. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I was thrilled when the judges told me I had won first prize. It was the first time I felt that maybe my photography was really good and that I could actually work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio and I've never regretted my choice.'

'I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) because they offer activities like camping and sailing, and I wanted to try new things. In the NYC, you can choose from different activities to challenge yourself and learn new skills. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers. When you complete each level, you get a certificate. When I first joined, my leader suggested I help organize activities at a local children's club for two hours a week. I was hesitant at first, as I had struggled to make friends at that club when I was younger. But I decided to take the challenge and, surprisingly, I ended up loving it. I wanted to spend more time at the club, and the NYC leader let me continue volunteering because I had built strong relationships with the children. Now, I'm there for about four hours a week and really enjoy it. The experience has inspired me to consider a career as a youth worker when I finish school in three years. Before joining the club, I hadn't thought about my future job, but now I'm excited about the possibility. This has been my favourite part of the NYC so far, and I've improved my communication skills while helping others.'

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B2:

I was born in Denver, USA, and started snowboarding when I was eight years old. My dad took me to a mountain resort about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, but my dad convinced me to try it. I was young and didn't think to ask if I could start snowboarding, but my dad loved it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy, and I ended up doing well. After that, I developed a passion for snowboarding and got better at it. I started competing when I was ten. Some people get bored with snowboarding, but my love for it has only grown stronger as I've gotten older. I enjoy not having a fixed plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to get a perfect score at a local competition. I wasn't sure I'd try the jumps that got me this score until I started doing them. This achievement made me more confident in my abilities.

In the summer, I focus on training and my studies when there's no snow. Although I train every day, it's nice not to have to stick to a strict diet like I do in the winter. I also get to spend time with my friends. It's a good way to deal with not being able to do what I love as much during the winter. I need to think about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life now, but I also think it's important to have something else I can do in case I don't make it as a professional snowboarder or get injured. I'm considering becoming a doctor, but I'm not sure if my active lifestyle will allow me to do a college degree. It's hard to imagine stopping snowboarding, but I know I can't do it forever.

When I was 15, I wanted everything my friends had. I didn't think about the future or what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I thought I should have one too. My parents said I could only have it if I paid for it myself, so I started working part-time to save up. My parents taught me a valuable lesson by making me do this.

I worked every Saturday at a café, but I didn't enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own business instead. I had seen my mum making necklaces, so I asked if I could try it too. I was surprised to find it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. My friends thought it sounded boring, but I was excited. My mum showed me that with basic tools and materials, I could make something attractive.

I sold my first necklaces to my friends and family, but I wasn't sure if they were really good. So, I rented a market stall with my mum to sell them to the public. Tourists bought lots of my things, and soon we were getting orders from all over the country. People thought we were a big company, but it was just my mum and me on the stall! That's when I knew it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Now, I've made thousands of pounds from my business, mostly online, and we still have our market stall too. It's been a lot of fun so far.

Janine Stuart wrote a book called Being Amelia when she was just 13 years old. The book became a bestseller. Janine's life inspired parts of the book. In an interview, she said that her family moved around a lot when she was growing up, so she learned to make new friends easily. This helped her write about the main character, Amelia, who starts at a new school. Janine also drew on her own experiences to describe Amelia's relationships with her family, including her older brother. Janine started writing the book during the summer holidays when she was feeling bored. Her parents had always encouraged her to write, and she had already won a writing competition the year before. When she finished the book, she sent it to a publishing company, and they loved it. A year later, the book was in bookstores. A reviewer praised the book, saying that despite the happy cover, the characters face some tough challenges, which makes them believable. The reviewer also thought that Janine was a talented writer, even at a young age. Janine is still getting used to being a famous author. At first, she was shy when people recognized her in the street, but now she's more comfortable. She advises young writers to find what works for them, and for her, spending time with friends helps her come up with new ideas.

I'm Tom, 15 years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved into a castle on a small island. My dad got a job as the castle's manager. He works for an organization that takes care of old buildings and makes them open to the public. At first, we were worried about moving to the island because there's no school and we didn't know what it would be like. But we got used to it quickly. The castle isn't very beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. In summer, lots of people visit the island and there are often parties on the beach. In winter, we only see the other families who live on the island, and there aren't many teenagers like me. The adults help each other with repairs on the island, which can be hard work. The biggest change for me was having to travel to school every day by boat. I like going on the boat on calm days, but sometimes the ferries don't run when there are big waves. If I miss the bus to the harbour after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which can be worrying. When my friends come to visit, I tell them to hurry up! We often see amazing views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Sometimes it's foggy, but then the sun comes out again, which is still amazing. We do get big storms, and sometimes I worry if the castle will be damaged. But it's been here for centuries, and it's still standing.

I live in a beautiful countryside in Scotland. I love nature and animals, and six years ago, I started a new hobby - birdwatching. I went to the mountains in northern Scotland with my family and saw many birds in their natural habitat. My parents taught me how to identify different species and find the best places to see them. It was amazing! After that, I joined a local birdwatching club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different bird species, and I've almost achieved it. I've been lucky enough to see birds from other countries on family holidays. We always look for places where there are birdwatching groups, so I can add new birds to my list.

I've been to Egypt and South America, where I tried to see my 200th species. It didn't happen, but I learned that patience is important in birdwatching. I shared a video about my challenge online, and many teenagers thought it was a fascinating hobby. My teachers asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I was a bit nervous, but it went well, and the teachers said I did a good job. I might even do another presentation next year!

I'm lucky to live in the countryside. I know that some teenagers in cities might not think of becoming birdwatchers, but there are many birds to see, especially in green areas. I think birdwatching clubs should encourage more young people to join. Everyone should connect with nature, regardless of age, and it doesn't have to cost much money.

My family thought I might get bored and stop playing, but I didn't. I dreamed of playing professionally when I grew up. And, surprisingly, an opportunity came sooner than I expected. I played in local tournaments, and a referee noticed my skills. He recommended me to the manager of a professional women's team. She asked me to join the team, and I was amazed - I had no idea girls could play in women's teams! The manager was impressed, and I started training with the team at the age of 13. I improved a lot, but some people still doubted I would become a star player, which made me feel a bit sad. However, my coach encouraged me to believe in myself and be myself. He even let me play in a championship match earlier than expected. I was nervous, but I scored the winning goal! After the match, my teammates carried me around the pitch. Since then, I've scored many more winning goals. Next month, I'll be organizing a football tournament in my area to get teenagers interested in the sport and to show them what it's like to play for a professional team.

""One of the most significant changes in higher education in the UK and worldwide over the past few years has been the encouragement of students to get involved in research from an early stage in their studies. This recognises that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists who are pushing the boundaries of our knowledge. It's a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills will be useful not only in your studies but also in your future career, as they are a way of thinking and working.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You don't just accept what you're told; you create it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions like 'Why?', 'How?', 'What does this mean?', and 'How can I do it differently?' These are the questions that underlie research.

Research can take many forms, from groundbreaking, complex, and intellectual work to everyday enquiries that involve careful planning and thoughtful questioning. Most students have been doing some form of research since they started studying or working. You may have asked questions and investigated answers at school or in the workplace. You may have also developed research skills when planning a holiday, fixing things around the house, or shopping online.

At college and university, you're expected to have an enquiring mind, identify problems and questions, and evaluate the information and ideas you read or hear about. Some students may struggle with this, as they may be used to accepting established knowledge and authority. However, in UK, US, European, and Australian higher education, established knowledge is meant to be questioned.

Critical thinking is crucial in research. It's not enough to simply accept what others have written or said. You need to engage with it, think about it, test it out, and identify whether it's logical and evidence-based. Don't just take facts and information at face value.""

Cities have always been a hub of intellectual activity. From the 18th-century coffeehouses in London, where people gathered to discuss chemistry and politics, to the cafes on the Left Bank in Paris, where artist Pablo Picasso talked about modern art. However, city life is not easy. The same coffeehouses that stimulated discussion also helped spread diseases like cholera. Picasso eventually left the city and moved to the countryside. The modern city is a place of creativity, but it can also be overwhelming and unnatural.

Scientists are now studying how cities affect our brains, and the results are surprising. While it's well-known that city life is exhausting, research suggests that cities can actually dull our thinking. One of the main reasons is the lack of nature. Studies have shown that patients recover faster when they can see trees from their hospital windows. Even brief glimpses of nature can improve our brain performance, as they give us a break from the urban routine.

This research comes at a time when most people live in cities. Instead of living in open spaces, we are now crowded into concrete jungles, surrounded by millions of strangers. In recent years, it's become clear that these unnatural surroundings have important implications for our mental and physical health, and can greatly affect how we think. For example, when we walk down a busy street, we have to constantly pay attention to pedestrians, traffic, and the urban grid. This can be exhausting because it requires a lot of mental effort.

The reason we feel depleted is that our brains have to constantly redirect our attention. Cities are so full of stimuli that we need to constantly focus on what's important and ignore what's not. This takes a lot of energy and effort. In contrast, natural settings don't require the same amount of mental effort.

This idea is called attention restoration theory. Psychologist Stephen Kaplan developed it. He suggested that being in nature can have a restorative effect on our brains. Natural settings are full of things that capture our attention, but they don't trigger negative emotions. This allows our brains to relax and replenish themselves.

Before scientists became concerned about the effects of cities, philosophers and landscape architects were warning about the dangers of city life and looking for ways to integrate nature into urban planning. Parks like Central Park in New York allow people to escape the city and improve their mental health. Research has shown that spending time in nature can improve our cognitive performance.

So, why do cities continue to grow, despite the mental problems they can cause? Research at the Santa Fe Institute found that the same urban features that trigger lapses in attention and memory also correlate with measures of innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities is what drives creativity. Just as the crowded nature of 18th-century London led to intellectual breakthroughs, the crowded nature of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, contributes to its success as a creative center. The key is to find ways to mitigate the negative effects of city life while maintaining its benefits.<|eot_id|>"

Where should we look for the mind? It seems obvious that thinking happens inside our heads. We can even use special machines to study our brains. However, I think we should consider the possibility that the mind extends beyond our bodies. There is a lot of evidence from archaeology that shows how objects and tools have played a crucial role in human development and the way we think.

It's easy to see why people often associate the mind with the brain. Most of what we know about the brain comes from studying people in isolation, away from their surroundings. This makes sense if you're a neuroscientist, but it can make us forget that our minds are also influenced by the world around us.

I'm not saying that the brain isn't important, but I think we need to consider the idea that our intelligence is not just limited to our brains. Instead, I propose that our minds extend beyond our bodies, into the world around us. This is what my theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), is all about.

MET explores how objects and tools become part of our minds, like when we use a stick to help us navigate the world. It also looks at how this has changed over time and what it means for the way we think.

For example, think about a blind person using a cane. Where does their sense of self begin? The stick becomes an extension of their body, and they use it to create a new way of experiencing the world. This shows us that our minds are capable of adapting and changing as we interact with the world around us.

I believe that our minds are always evolving and that we use technology to help us make sense of the world. This is what I call metaplasticity - our minds are constantly changing and developing as we interact with the material world. I want to emphasize the importance of material culture in shaping our thoughts and minds.

In short, MET offers a new way of understanding how different objects and tools have helped shape our minds and the way we think. It's not just about the brain; it's about the world around us and how we interact with it.<|eot_id|>"

Photography has had a significant impact on the way we perceive the world. In the United States, photography became an integral part of American culture, influencing various aspects of society, from science and industry to art and entertainment. Historians argue that photography is the country's greatest contribution to the visual arts. This claim is significant because photography has become central to American intellectual and artistic discourse.

Photography's appeal can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, its mechanical process aligned with the growing enthusiasm for technology in the United States. Secondly, the camera allowed people to capture and share images of themselves and their families, which was important in a country where individual and national identities were constantly evolving. Thirdly, photography became a means of recording family history and creating a sense of identity.

Photographs are also aesthetically pleasing, as they provide a realistic representation of everyday life. They can be seen as a way of drawing attention to something, saying, ""Look at this!"" The fact that photographs are created by machines makes them unique, as they are records of events, people, and things. However, they also carry a subjective element, as the photographer's perspective is always present.

To fully understand a photograph, it's essential to consider its purpose, function, and cultural context. We need to know why the photographer took the image, how it was initially received, and how its meaning might change over time and in different contexts. The camera's importance in art has become increasingly acknowledged, and many artists have incorporated photographs into their work.

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of English at the B2 level:

William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the'science of mental life' in 1890. This definition remains relevant today. We all have a mental life, and we have some idea of what this means. However, studying psychology can be challenging because it is difficult to understand the workings of the mind. James believed that human psychology consists of basic elements: thoughts, feelings, and a physical world that exists in time and space. Each of us has personal knowledge based on our own experiences, thoughts, and feelings. This knowledge may or may not be influenced by scientific facts.

When we think about psychological issues, we often rely on our own experiences and opinions. We behave like amateur psychologists when we discuss complex psychological phenomena, such as whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways. However, problems arise when people have different opinions. Formal psychology aims to provide methods for determining which explanations are most likely to be correct.

Psychologists study the brain, but they do not fully understand how it works. They often study behavior and use observations to develop hypotheses about what is happening inside us. The study of psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting clues, which are derived from careful observation and analysis.

Psychology has the same goals as other sciences: to describe, understand, predict, and modify the processes it studies. By achieving these goals, psychology can help us understand our experiences and apply its findings to people's lives. Psychological research has been useful in various fields, such as education, design, and mental health.

Psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, but they have only been studied scientifically for the past 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to study the mind. However, this method has limitations. Contemporary psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of the phenomena they are interested in, rather than on self-reflection.

Here is a rewritten version of the text at a level suitable for a learner of English at B2:

In a warehouse in Michigan, USA, there is a unique collection of failed products. It's called the Museum of Failed Products. The museum's owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has its own story of failure, which is often a result of mistakes made by designers, marketers, and salespeople. What's surprising is that this museum exists as a successful business. Many companies would have their own collection of failed products, but surprisingly, they don't. The museum's owner, Robert McMath, started collecting products in the 1960s with the intention of creating a reference library. However, he ended up with a collection of mostly unsuccessful products. This is because most products fail.

The culture of optimism might be responsible for the existence of these failed products. Each product must have been approved by several people before being released, and even if they knew it was doomed, there was a pressure to invest more money to make it work. Nobody wants to talk about their failures, so the products are left to gather dust. This is particularly true in the self-help industry, where people are encouraged to focus on positive thinking. However, research suggests that this approach might not be effective. Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that spending time thinking about how well things could go actually reduces people's motivation to achieve their goals. On the other hand, psychologist Carol Dweck believes that our experiences of failure are influenced by our beliefs about ability. People who believe that ability is fixed are more likely to be discouraged by failure, while those who believe that ability can be developed through hard work and challenge see failure as an opportunity to learn and grow.

Playing at home is often considered an advantage for sports teams. But why is this the case? Many people assume it's obvious, but professional sports are changing, and what we used to think was true may not be true anymore. Two main factors have challenged our understanding of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to know what makes players perform well, and they have come up with many theories about home advantage. Meanwhile, those who make money from sports want to know why home advantage matters. If players are well-paid, shouldn't they feel comfortable anywhere?

This raises a question: would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some of its home games in a different country to attract more fans? It would matter to the fans who believe their team needs their passion and loyalty to win.

Many fans think that when their team scores a goal, it's because of their cheering. But this isn't always true. In fact, there are many times when the team doesn't score, even when the fans are cheering. However, there is one thing that fans do that seems to have a real effect: they shout at the referee. Researchers found that referees who heard the sound of cheering fans were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This is because the referees try to avoid making decisions that might make the crowd angry.

Studies have shown that home advantage has decreased over time in most sports. In the past, home teams used to win around 70% of the time, but now it's around 60%. This might be because travel is easier now, and players are treated better on the road. However, none of these explanations fully explain why home advantage varies from sport to sport. For example, basketball is the sport where playing at home is most advantageous, while baseball is the sport where home advantage counts the least.

One possible reason for this difference is that team sports, like basketball, rely on teamwork, which builds confidence and familiarity with teammates. In sports like baseball, individual players are more important, and there may be less teamwork. Another possibility is that playing at home boosts players' testosterone levels, making them more aggressive and motivated to defend their home turf.

In the end, the mystery of home advantage remains, and it's up to researchers to continue studying it.<|eot_id|>"

'The more I practice, the better I get,' said the golfer Gary Player many years ago. This phrase is famous in the world of sports and is valued by top athletes and coaches. It's easy to understand why. The phrase is often disputed, with some people arguing that other golfers said it first. The meaning is also unclear - Player was being ironic and meant that the more he practiced, the better he became. However, the phrase has sparked a debate about whether talent is natural or acquired. This debate is not balanced, with most experts agreeing that practice is more important than innate talent. The idea that practice is key to success in any field, including sports, music, and business, comes from the work of psychologist Anders Ericsson. He suggests that with 10,000 hours of practice, anyone can become an expert. Many books have been written about this idea, but a new book argues that it's not that simple. The author, Epstein, believes that there are many factors that contribute to someone's success, including their genes, environment, support, and determination. He looks at many examples, including the world's toughest sled dog race in Alaska, where the dogs' drive and desire are crucial. This challenges the idea that commitment and determination are choices that can be made. Epstein also examines the importance of both nature (genetics) and nurture (environment) in elite athletes. He agrees that both are necessary, but also looks at cases where genetics play a significant role. The book also touches on the issues of race and gender in sports, asking why men and women are separated in competitions. Sometimes the simplest questions are the most important ones.'

A recent report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel unhappy and lonely. Jay Griffiths asks: why are today's children so unhappy? In her book, Kith, Griffiths argues that children have become too dependent on screens and have lost touch with nature. They spend too much time indoors, watching TV or using computers, and have forgotten how to connect with the natural world. This is the main problem, she believes.

A study found that many children want to spend more time outdoors. They don't want more gadgets, they just want to be free to play outside. Many adults remember their own childhoods fondly, when they spent hours playing in the woods, swimming in rivers, or building dens in old sheds. They say that was a healthier and happier time than today.

Griffiths argues that the fear of danger has led parents to keep their children indoors, and this plays into the hands of the toy and gadget industry. She also criticises the trend of prescribing medication for restless children or requiring them to wear goggles during playground games. She believes that children should be allowed to take risks and learn to manage them.

However, Griffiths' ideas are not without criticism. Some argue that she romanticises childhood and ignores the complexities of parenting. She believes that children should be given more freedom and autonomy, but doesn't provide a clear plan for achieving this. Additionally, not all children may want to follow the ""wild"" model she advocates for. What about the children who are naturally timid or cautious?

Overall, Griffiths' book raises important questions about the way we treat children and the kind of childhood we want to provide for them.<|eot_id|>"

As a research psychologist, I've learned that the skills we need to solve problems in life can't be taught in school. They come from our experiences and the way we think. Children learn by playing, and this is true for all mammals, including humans. The more complex the problem, the more we need to learn, and the more we need to play.

Play is a natural way for humans and animals to learn. It's how we develop important skills like creativity, cooperation, and self-control. These skills are essential for a happy and productive life. Unfortunately, schools are not providing children with the opportunities to learn these skills. Instead, they are focusing on teaching children what to do, rather than letting them discover things for themselves.

Creativity is key to success in today's world. We need people who can think creatively and come up with new ideas. This is something that can't be taught, but it can be encouraged by allowing children to play and explore. Adults who are creative and innovative are those who have retained their childlike curiosity and sense of play.

Unfortunately, children are not being given the opportunity to play as much as they used to. Schools are becoming more structured, and parents are more involved in their children's lives. This is leading to a decline in the amount of time children have to play and explore. We need to give children the freedom to play and make their own decisions. This is the key to helping them develop into happy, confident, and successful adults.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B2:

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to look for a job. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to contact potential employers directly. However, this increased access also means there's a higher chance of making mistakes. A recent incident in the US shows how important it is to use social media correctly. A young jobseeker contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn, hoping to get help finding a job. The executive was upset and sent a harsh rejection message that went viral. The incident highlights the importance of being careful when using social media for professional purposes.

For many young people, social media is a part of their daily life, and they may not realize that using it for professional purposes is different. They may be used to sharing personal information and opinions online, but this is not suitable for a professional setting. When using social media for job hunting, it's essential to be clear about who you are and what you can offer. Avoid sending impersonal messages and be humble in your approach.

In the past, social media was used for personal purposes, like escaping the rules and expectations of parents and teachers. It was a place to create a fantasy identity and connect with others. However, this experience may not prepare young people for the professional world, where they need to be professional and respectful.

Employers often complain that young job seekers on professional networking sites come across as arrogant or over-familiar. This can damage their chances of getting a job, even if they have the skills and drive to be successful. To make a good impression, it's essential to be clear, respectful, and professional in your online communication.

The key to using social media for job hunting is to be careful and considerate. Explain who you are and what you can offer, and be prepared to help the person you're contacting in some way. By doing so, you'll increase your chances of getting a positive response.<|eot_id|>"

To simplify the text for a learner of level B2, I will make some adjustments to the vocabulary, sentence structure, and paragraph organization while maintaining the factual content. Here is the revised text:

Newspapers are facing a crisis. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national dailies has decreased by a third to half. In the US, the Pew Research Centre reports that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26% of citizens, down from 45% in 2001. Many experts predict that the last printed newspaper will be gone within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. For example, theatre, despite predictions of its demise, has continued to thrive.

Newspapers were once a new medium, but it took centuries for them to become the dominant way to get news. This was due to advances in technology, such as the steam press, railway, and telegraph, which made it possible to produce and distribute news quickly and cheaply. Additionally, people began to understand that the world is constantly changing and that they need to stay informed about what's happening.

In the past, people did not need news on a regular basis. In fact, the concept of needing daily or weekly news is a relatively recent development. Before the 19th century, people's lives were more predictable, with the changing of the seasons being the main event. News was not a priority, and journalism as a profession did not exist.

Now, with the internet, people can access news whenever and wherever they want. Online news providers can update stories in real-time, correct mistakes, and provide more in-depth information. However, despite these advantages, many news providers are focused on being the first to break a story, rather than providing in-depth analysis and understanding. This is a departure from the traditional role of newspapers, which was to inform and educate readers.

In some ways, the way we consume news today is similar to how it was in the past. In medieval times, news was shared in marketplaces and taverns, where rumors and misinformation were common. Today, with the internet, we are bombarded with information, and it's easy to get confused. Newspapers, which were never great at explaining how the world works, may face extinction. Alternatively, they may find a new way to guide us towards understanding and wisdom in this chaotic world.

I made the following changes:

1. Simplified vocabulary: I replaced complex words and phrases with more straightforward alternatives, such as ""crisis"" instead of ""doomed"", ""decrease"" instead of ""fall"", and ""predict"" instead of ""forecast"".
2. Shortened sentences: I broke up long sentences into shorter, simpler ones to improve readability.
3. Rearranged paragraphs: I reorganized the text to group related ideas together and make it easier to follow.
4. Removed complex concepts: I omitted or simplified complex ideas, such as the concept of ""ineluctable cyclical"" and ""recurring truths"", to make the text more accessible.
5. Added transitions: I added transitional phrases, such as ""However"" and ""In addition"", to connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a learner of level B2:

If we were meant to live under the light of the moon and stars, we would be comfortable in the dark. However, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in sunlight. This is deeply ingrained in our biology, even though we don't often think about it. We've managed to engineer the night to suit ourselves by filling it with artificial light. This has consequences, known as light pollution, which scientists are only now studying.

Light pollution is mainly caused by poorly designed lighting that shines upwards into the sky, rather than downwards where it's needed. This washes out the natural darkness, affecting many forms of life, including humans. Where artificial light enters the natural world, it can disrupt natural rhythms and behaviors, such as migration, reproduction, and feeding.

In the past, the concept of light pollution wouldn't have made sense. Imagine walking through a moonlit London in the 1800s, when it was a much smaller city. The only light came from candles, torches, and lanterns. You would have been more likely to smell the city than see it from afar.

We've lit up the night as if it were an empty space, but it's not. Many species, including mammals, are nocturnal and rely on the night. Light can be a powerful attractant, and scientists have seen birds being drawn to artificial light sources, even to the point of colliding with buildings.

It's not just astronomers who are affected by light pollution; we all need darkness to maintain our biological rhythms. Denying ourselves darkness can lead to physical problems. Our bodies rely on the natural cycle of day and night to function properly.

In the end, we're just as trapped by light pollution as the frogs near a brightly lit highway. By living in a world of artificial light, we've cut ourselves off from our natural heritage and our place in the universe. Light pollution makes us forget the scale of our existence, which is best appreciated in the depths of a dark night with the Milky Way above.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B2:

A multinational company has announced that it will no longer track its employees' paid holiday time. The idea came from an internet company that has a similar policy. The founder of the multinational company says that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they are sure it won't harm the business. However, this approach may not be practical for a large company with many different departments and employees.

In a small company, it's easier for employees to know each other's workloads and schedules, so they can take leave without worrying about the impact on the business. But in a large company, it's harder to keep track of everything, and employees may feel guilty or stressed about taking leave.

Additionally, the policy may lead to a culture of not taking leave at all, or feeling pressured to work long hours to keep up with colleagues. This could result in decreased productivity and morale. The company's policy also blurs the line between work and leisure time, making it difficult for employees to disconnect from work.

The article questions whether unlimited leave is a good idea, especially for a large company. It suggests that employees need a minimum amount of statutory paid annual leave to rest and recharge, and that this is important for their mental and physical health. The article concludes that the policy may not achieve its intended goals and may even have negative consequences.

Here is the simplified text for a level B2 learner:

Journal-based peer review is the process of checking a scientific research paper by experts in the same field. It's meant to ensure that the paper is accurate and trustworthy. However, some people question whether it's worth the delay in publication. I'm not ready to give up journal-based peer review, but I think it's changing. The use of preprints, or early drafts of papers, is becoming more common. Preprints are posted online without being reviewed and are stored in digital archives. This allows academics to share their research quickly and get feedback from others. In the past, publication in journals was about sharing new findings, but now it's often about getting recognition and advancing one's career. This has changed the way authors and reviewers work. Authors may leave out important data to get published in top journals, and reviewers focus on whether a paper is good enough for the journal rather than its quality. These problems are well-known, but many scientists are reluctant to change the system. However, some experts think that preprints could be a solution because they don't require a major change. Preprints have been around for 20 years, but they haven't been widely used. This is partly due to the misconception that journals won't accept papers that have been posted online as preprints. Some people also worry that publishing papers without review will lead to 'junk science', but this hasn't happened so far. In reality, preprints are open to critique and discussion by the scientific community. One professor recalls that posting a preprint allowed her to get feedback from the original authors and readers could evaluate the quality of the arguments. Preprints could also be used to share negative results, which are often overlooked in the pursuit of new discoveries. By using preprints, we can refocus on the work itself, not where it's published.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a level B2 learner:

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it's like a picture made with words. But I'm not satisfied with that answer. One day, I asked them to write two paragraphs about an object. The first paragraph should describe the object in a scientific way, like a scientist would. The second paragraph should be written from the object's point of view, and it should be called 'Poem'. One student chose an oxygen mask and wrote: 'I'm a device that helps people breathe. I'm only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me.' This exercise helped us understand how poetry is unique and special.

When I was in school, I didn't understand poetry. I thought it was just a puzzle that got in the way of understanding and feeling. Now, I know that poetry can be many things: a way to express deep feelings, a source of stunning images, or a place for reflection and wit. But what do we hope to find in a poem? Do we look for tears, information, or a good story? Poetry is not like films, articles, or novels. It has its own special qualities. One of these is ambiguity, which is a part of our daily lives.

We often ask ourselves what a poem is. Some people compare poems to wild animals or machines, but these comparisons don't really work. The most important thing is to think about what a poem is and how it makes us see things in a new way. Poetry can be like a song, with words and music that get stuck in our heads. And even though a poem is just words on a page, it can have a powerful impact. It can surprise us and make us think.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the rewritten text, simplified for a learner of level B2:

I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It was a big expense, and my wife thought I should have spent the money on something more practical for our home. However, when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing, she was impressed. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've discovered has given me a sense of connection to the past, which I find very satisfying. But it wasn't until 40 years later that I found something that impressed her as much as the gold ring. On a rainy February afternoon, I decided to search a spot I knew contained old farming equipment. My detector beeped, and I uncovered a piece of a metal wheel. Then, it beeped again. I couldn't ignore it, so I dug down half a meter and found a golden ball. I thought it might be a piece of old curtain rail, but as I brushed away more dirt, it turned out to be a beautiful, intricately patterned loop. I was amazed. The loop reminded me of the Great Torc, a famous necklace from Iron Age Britain, over 2,000 years ago. I took it home and showed it to my wife, Marion. We didn't try it on, as it was too valuable and delicate. We hid it in our wardrobe, but I was worried about it getting stolen, so I eventually hid it under a floorboard in my office. The law says that finds like this must be reported to the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy it for a while before giving it up, so I even took it to show a friend in hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office, where it was authenticated and eventually sold to the British Museum. The £350,000 proceeds were split between the landowner and me. The torc has been more than just a lucky find; it's something I've preserved for the nation. People ask me if I'll stop detecting now that I've made such a big find, but I don't think so. I'll keep searching, as there might be even bigger finds to come.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of level B2:

Sleep is one of my favorite things to do while traveling. However, I don't usually talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends share their detailed travel plans, which include many activities, I smile and don't say much. But my travel itineraries often have empty slots for taking naps in the afternoon or sleeping in late in the morning. I think that's one of the best things about traveling. When I visited the Yucatán coast in Mexico, I slept for more than 12 hours a day. It was amazing to sleep so much and have such vivid dreams. Traveling makes it easier to fall asleep because I'm not worried about my daily routine or responsibilities.

I think that sleep is an important part of traveling. When we travel, we experience new things, like different cultures, music, and landscapes. Sleep is when our brains process all these new experiences. That's why sleep can be so intense when we're on the road. Sleep can also change depending on where we are. For example, in Trinidad, people wake up early, take a break in the middle of the day, and then go out again in the evening. It took me a few days to get used to this rhythm. When I finally adjusted, I felt like I was really part of the local culture.

Travel sleep has another advantage: it's something I remember. When I'm in a new place, I notice the smells, sounds, and textures that fill my dreams. If being a slow traveler means taking the time to enjoy every experience, then sleep is the ultimate slow travel activity. Maybe I should stop feeling guilty and tell my friends that sleeping is an important part of my travel experiences.

The woman turned around from the mirror. 'What do you think? Be honest,' she said to Mia, her hat stylist. Mia showed her a medium-sized hat with a soft, gauzy layer and a silk bow. 'I think this one suits you best,' she said politely. The woman wrinkled her nose and frowned, looking like a bulldog. 'But it's so common. Everyone will be wearing a hat like that at my daughter's wedding. This little hat, on the other hand, will make me stand out.' She patted the red and black hat on her head. 'Yes, this is the one I want.' Mia knew when to give in and agreed that the woman would certainly stand out at the wedding. As she thought about it, Mia remembered her own daughter Jen's birthday, which was today. They were having a family gathering and Mia was looking forward to seeing Jen, her son Dan, and her youngest son Luke. She was also excited to meet Jen's friend Tattie, whom she had never met before. Mia's husband Jeff had been skeptical about Tattie's unusual name, but Mia thought it was nice. Jeff didn't like things that were too fancy or showy. He would have told the woman in the shop straight out that she was making a mistake and that a dustbin lid would be more flattering. Mia, on the other hand, was too polite for her own good, according to Jeff. After closing the shop, Mia walked into her home, Medlar House, which was just a short walk from the shop. Four years ago, she had converted the old barn into a light and airy space where she could sell hats. Jeff had been doubtful at first, but Mia had been convinced that there was a demand for unique hats. And she was right. From the start, her business, Mia's Hats, had been successful. Women came from all around to try on hats in her cozy showroom in the village of Little Pelham. Mia encouraged them to bring their outfits and try on as many hats as they needed to find the perfect one. Recently, she had started selling handbags and costume jewelry as well.<|eot_id|>"

Lawrence Okoye has come a long way from his home in London to Atlanta, where he is now training for a new sport - American football. It's hard to believe that a 21-year-old from London could make it to one of the top teams in the USA, but Lawrence has a track record of achieving the unexpected. He was ranked the world's fourth-best discus-thrower just 20 months after starting to train. Originally, he came to Atlanta to prepare for the world championships in discus, but he decided to give American football a try. Despite never having played the sport before, he was picked for the trials in Atlanta.

Lawrence is still learning about his new position, but he's confident in his abilities. He's not nervous about being tested alongside experienced players, and his performance in drills and tests impressed the coaches. He's not getting too excited about the possibility of being selected, saying he's not under pressure and that many people think he'll make the team. This might be because he's still recovering from a disappointing experience at the Olympics, where he came last in the discus final. However, he's moved on and is focusing on his new goal.

Lawrence has already achieved a lot in his career, switching from rugby to athletics and now to American football. Some people might think it's better for him to focus on one sport, but Lawrence is determined to follow his dreams. If he doesn't make it in American football, he can always go back to discus, which he loves. He believes every decision he's made has been calculated, and he's willing to take the risk to achieve his goals.

I had been flying for hours when I woke up to see the sunrise. As I looked out the window, I saw a vast, empty landscape with mountains, rivers, and forests stretching to the horizon. I was relieved to see that it was still September and not yet winter in Siberia. My neighbour, Sergei, a salesman from Moscow, woke up and greeted me with a sleepy smile. He was on his way to sell safety clothes to mining companies in the remote areas of Siberia. I told him I was flying to Magadan, a city in eastern Siberia, with only a one-way ticket because I planned to cycle back to England. Sergei was surprised and asked if I was going alone. I said yes, but I would be with a friend, Al. He looked unconvinced and pointed outside, saying it was cold. I explained that I had warm clothes and would be fine. Sergei still looked doubtful.

It all started when I was a student in Scotland. I was thinking about a problem and decided to ask my friend Al if he wanted to cycle across the Karakorum Highway in Pakistan and China with me. He agreed, and it was six years later that I was going to join him in Siberia. I had been working as a geography teacher, which was challenging but fulfilling, and I had used my holidays to go on adventures with Al. He had become more adventurous after our bike ride in Pakistan and decided to cycle around the world. This trip was his biggest challenge yet. Sometimes he felt like giving up, but he was determined to prove to himself and others that he could do it.

In the Red Bull Air Race, 12 pilots compete by flying through a course with 15-25 meter high pylons. They perform sharp turns, barrel rolls, and loops at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I was invited to experience it firsthand. Before the flight, I had to sign two forms: one confirming my good health and another promising to empty my pockets, as small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I also learned that I had to stay focused and oriented throughout the flight.

The pilot told me to look at the horizon to stay oriented and to relax when flying upside down. During the safety briefing, I was instructed not to touch anything. When we took off, I felt a mix of excitement and fear. The pilot, Dario, and I were in the Zivko Edge 540, one of the world's fastest acrobatic planes. We accelerated down the runway, and then Dario banked sharply to the right. The sudden movement made me feel like my air was being squeezed out. I looked up at the horizon, tensed up, and let out short gasps as I sank into the seat. We levelled out, turned left, and dived, leaving my stomach behind. Then we flew low over the ground, aiming for the narrow space between two pylons. They passed by quickly, but I was too busy holding on to enjoy the view.

For two minutes, I got to fly the plane, and it was incredibly responsive. Then Dario asked me if I was okay, and instead of answering, he did a barrel roll. I was a bit overwhelmed, but I said I was fine. He did another loop, flying upside down, and told me to relax and look up. I saw some fields and thought the flight was over. It was over in 10 minutes, which was a relief. The pilots who race in the Red Bull Air Race have to endure much more than this.

After the flight, Dario ate sandwiches, but I didn't feel like eating for hours. That night, I had a vivid dream, reliving the flight over and over again.

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films animals in cold places. He's been to many extreme locations, including Antarctica. He used to work as a marine biologist and commercial diver, which helped him learn about survival in cold environments. His big break came when a TV crew asked him to help film a wildlife documentary in Antarctica. He loved the experience and decided to become a wildlife cameraman. He's now worked on many famous TV wildlife series.

When he started, filming in cold places was very challenging. The camera and communication technology were basic, and he had to remember every shot he took. Now, with digital technology, he can shoot a lot and review it immediately. This makes it easier to capture amazing footage.

Doug has a lot of experience filming in cold conditions and knows how to stay safe. He's spent a lot of time on sea ice and is comfortable in these environments. He's also had some funny moments while filming, like when he didn't recognize a type of bird in the Orkneys.

Recently, Doug went to Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, to film polar bears. It was a challenging assignment, with temperatures as low as -32°C and strong winds. He spent 23 days walking and waiting for a glimpse of the bears, but finally, on the 24th day, he saw a mother bear and her cub. He was thrilled to capture the moment on camera.

Doug is now planning to make a documentary about climate change in the Arctic, talking to people who live there and experiencing the impact of climate change firsthand. He thinks this could be an extraordinary documentary.

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without help. He had to swim in very cold water, fight frostbite, and protect himself from polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole too. Now he's going back to the Arctic for an even more challenging expedition. Pen is an explorer who is confident and driven. He has to be, as he's taking a big risk. This time, he'll be on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre trek to the North Pole with two colleagues. They will take detailed measurements of the ice to understand how it's changing due to global warming. This will be the most accurate picture yet of what's happening to the polar ice. Pen has been trained for this job since he was a child. His father's old nanny, who used to work for a famous polar explorer, helped toughen him up by sending him out in the cold with minimal clothing. His father passed on his love of adventure, and Pen grew up to be very strong physically. He's married to Mary, a horsewoman, who says he has a strong character and shares his love of the outdoors. She helps him run his polar guide business and is worried about him when he's away. Pen and his family live in the countryside with their two children. He's more anxious about leaving them this time because he made a mistake last time by telling his son he was in charge while he was away. He's planning to have minimal contact with them while he's in the Arctic to avoid reminding them of his distance. Pen is preparing his kit obsessively, knowing that he won't be able to fix things easily when he's on the ice. He'll be with Ann Daniels, a leading polar explorer, and Martin Hartley, a photographer. They'll have a team of six supporting them, bringing in supplies. Pen finds it stressful to be part of a team, and he's also worried about his age – he's turning 47 soon. He's done less training than he's comfortable with, and he's unsure what he'll ask of himself. Pen believes his mission is important because it connects exploration with the search for knowledge that drove previous generations to explore.

I took a year off after being an Olympic athlete. I wanted to stay in shape, so I started doing marathons and triathlons. I also had the opportunity to do more writing and TV work, and to speak to businesses and schools. However, I missed the competitive feeling I had as an athlete. I was tempted to row across the Atlantic with TV presenter Ben Fogle, who had invited me to join him. I loved the movement of rowing and was starting to miss it. I spoke to my rowing friends about joining the race, but they weren't interested. I knew that if I entered the race, I would want to win, but with Ben, I would be the underdog. We discussed the costs of the race, which were £70,000, and the loss of earnings I would experience by being away from home. I had to weigh up the pros and cons. I eventually decided to join the race because it would be a new challenge and a way to earn money by speaking about my experiences. I learned a lot while preparing for the race, including appreciating the ease of being a full-time athlete. I was worried about people's reactions to me racing with a TV presenter, but my concerns disappeared as we prepared for the race. The Atlantic Rowing Race is not just about physical strength, but also mental toughness. Ben had completed other challenging races, but he was not experienced in rowing. I was surprised by how little he knew about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of patience. I realized that he needed a lot of improvement, and I should have expected this when I agreed to race with him.

About a year ago, I decided to leave my job and work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. At 26, I felt restless and wanted a change from the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company run by Anna McCormack and her husband Pasi Ikonen in Finnish Lapland. They took me on as a husky dog handler for the winter season, from December to February. During this time, they took tourists on sled rides pulled by huskies across the ice and snow. They started with six dogs, but soon had over 100.

I joined the team for three months, knowing it would be a tough and physical job. When I arrived, I was given a list of over 100 husky names to memorize, but I was distracted and anxious. I decided to focus on the scenery outside the plane window instead. As we flew, I noticed that winter was moving south, and the rivers were freezing over.

When I arrived at the farm, I was handed a pair of boots and sent out into the cold. Anna asked if I wanted to be thrown in at the deep end, and I knew what she meant. I followed the sound of barking and saw the huskies being harnessed to sleds. They were excited and straining to get going. I introduced myself, but the others were too busy to talk much. I rubbed the forehead of a quieter dog and someone gestured for me to get on a sled. We set off into the dark, with only a head torch for light.

It didn't take long to learn the basics of dog-sledding, but I had to learn quickly. I had to drive a snowmobile, do some woodwork, and chop wood with an axe. It was all new and challenging, but I was determined to learn. By the end of my first week, my head was spinning with instructions, and my muscles ached from dragging heavy sleds.

Radcliffe said she didn't really think about her achievement at the time. She and her team had decided not to set any limits for her, and she just focused on the race.

During the race, her coach and physiotherapist were worried about her pace, but Radcliffe's physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was confident in her ability to keep going. With 800 meters left, Radcliffe realized she could finish in under 2 hours and 16 minutes if she sprinted to the finish. She did just that, crossing the line in 2 hours, 25 minutes, and 25 seconds.

After the race, people were amazed by her achievement, especially considering her running style. Hartmann said that Radcliffe was one of the most dedicated athletes he had ever worked with, and that her ability to push herself to the limit was what made her so successful. Radcliffe believes that her mental toughness was key to her success, and that she was able to keep going because she never gave up.

Radcliffe's record-breaking performance inspired many women to take up long-distance running, and she left a lasting legacy in the sport.

When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was first broadcast, I wasn't sure how people would react. There was a lot of talk about a 'food revolution' in Britain, and I thought our show would make a significant contribution to it. But I was worried: would people appreciate an approach to cooking that combines techniques, history, nostalgia, and science? I watched the first episode with a mix of excitement and anxiety. I didn't need to worry, though. The show's success paved the way for other exciting projects, including a book based on my experiences at my restaurant. In each project, I feel like I'm on a journey, whether it's into the past, into people's minds, or into cooking techniques. I then wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one accompanying a TV show of the same name. In these books, the journey is often a physical one, with travel and adventure. In Search of Total Perfection is the latest in the series, and in it, you'll travel the world to meet extraordinary people who have spent years perfecting their craft. Perfection is subjective, and even choosing which dishes to include in the series was a challenge. I knew I'd upset some people by leaving out their favorite dishes. But after a lot of discussion, my team and I came up with a list that everyone could agree on. This reinforced my idea that each of us has our own idea of perfection, based on our personal experiences and emotions. Despite the title of the book, I knew that the recipes wouldn't be definitive. But I believed that by combining my technical skills, scientific knowledge, and conversations with food producers and chefs, I could identify the key elements that make these dishes work. The TV series gave me the opportunity to explore new foods, people, and places, and I was excited about that. Searching for the best ingredients took me all over the world. Along the way, I had some interesting experiences, such as visiting a canning factory that wasn't processing the right type of tomato and a dairy farm that didn't meet my standards. Refining each recipe required a lot of experimentation, and I even tried hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanner, and trying to make a Neapolitan-style pizza in my own oven.<|eot_id|>"

We were still a long way from Marrakech when our van broke down. It veered off the road and stopped in a field. John got out to take a look at the engine. He stood there for a while, looking serious. 'I have no idea what I'm doing,' he said eventually, and he and Mum started laughing. Bea was worried. 'We can't stay here forever,' she said. The field was empty, just grass and some flowers. 'We can't stay here forever,' I repeated, because it's always better to agree with Bea. We got back in the van and waited for John to stop laughing. We sat on the side of the road and watched John walk away to find someone who knew about cars. Mum lay down on the grass. 'Tell us a story,' she said. Bea lay down next to her. 'Go on, tell us a story.' So I told them about the birds I heard talking in London the day before we left. I told them what the birds had talked about. Breadcrumbs, other birds, the weather... I even told them about the argument they had over a worm. 'That's stupid, no one understands bird language,' Bea said. My eyes started to sting. 'I do,' I said, but my voice didn't sound very convincing. 'Liar,' Bea said. I felt embarrassed. How could I be lying if I remembered every single word? The more I thought about it, the less sure I was. 'Mum...?' But she was already asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to a nearby hotel. Bea refused to get out, but the boys didn't mind. They waved and smiled at her through the back door. We followed John to a café near the hotel. It was a nice place with a shady patio. 'It's a hotel,' John whispered. 'I think it might be a bit expensive.' 'We'll just have some tea,' Mum said, and we sat down. The tea was made with mint leaves and was very sweet. Mum looked at the pot. 'It's like syrup in there,' she said. We stayed at the café all day while John tried to fix the van. 'I suppose it's a miracle it got us this far,' he said when it started to get dark. Mum made a bed for us on the road, and we slept in the hotel garden. It was nice to sleep on solid ground. 'I'll have to have us towed into Marrakech,' John said later. Half an hour later, we were sitting in a truck, watching our van being towed behind us. At first, Bea didn't want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck himself. Now she was sitting in the front with the driver. I wondered how we'd get home now that our van was broken. I thought it might be easier if we could take a boat straight to London. Then I must have fallen asleep.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a learner of English at the B2 level:

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at a welcome party in the hotel ballroom. They were both older than her, from Tokyo and a European city, and they could speak English well enough to talk about their music and travels. Lucy mentioned that she was going to the Tanglewood festival, which sounded impressive. However, she didn't really want to go. She had been traveling the world for concerts and competitions, missing a lot of school and eventually dropping out. Instead, she worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco.

Lucy's mother had entered her into the Prague Festival without asking her, saying she didn't want Lucy to be disappointed if she didn't get in. Lucy didn't like being pushed into things she didn't want to do. The man from Tokyo asked Lucy how old she was, and she said 15. He and the other woman, Liesel or Louisa, were surprised. Lucy didn't mean to brag, but it's hard to find the right balance between sharing information and showing off.

Lucy's grandfather appeared and took her away from the conversation, telling her not to get too friendly with the other pianists. He introduced her to important people and made her talk to them, but Lucy didn't really listen. After the party, her grandfather praised her for doing well and told her that people at the festival knew who she was. Lucy liked being someone important, even if it meant that some people were jealous or thought she was too young.

'It's not good for you to spend too much time online,' my dad said. I decided to find out what experts think about this. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have a wide circle of friends, a good sense of identity, and are learning important technical skills. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says that social networking is just a part of modern childhood. Teenagers don't just use social media to check emails or look at pictures, they live it. It's not good or bad, it's what you do with it that matters.

Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says that social networking is like hanging out at the youth club, where you share jokes and gossip with friends. It helps teenagers develop their identity and learn to deal with problems and get along with others.

Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says that social networking can help you figure out who you are and what you like. You can post about your favorite music or sports and see what others think. Research shows that people who use social media a lot are not as self-centered as those who don't.

Professor Andrew Phillips says that social media can be helpful if you're shy or have a special interest. You can connect with others who like the same things as you. Pauline White, a digital education expert, says that teenagers who use social media to find new interests, join groups, and create their own content are really making the most of it. They're making videos, podcasts, and blogs about things they're interested in. This is a creative force that will help them in their future careers.

She also says that photo-sharing sites are changing the way we think about creativity. Teenagers can network with other photographers, learn new skills, and share their photos. This will help them in the workplace, where every business uses social media to sell and promote their brand.

Teenagers who use social media to be creative will have an advantage when they enter the workforce. They'll be able to collaborate with others to create content and share it with others. This is an important skill for the 21st century and will help them get a job.'<|eot_id|>"

When most people think of a family vacation, they don't usually imagine a long road trip across nine US states and one Canadian province. But my parents had other plans. They decided to take us on a road trip, and my dad seemed to have planned the ultimate family bonding experience. He kept saying, ""Not enough people do this anymore,"" and my mom agreed. My twin brother and I were not thrilled about the idea, but we packed our bags and set off on our adventure.

We drove through Oklahoma, where we had some exciting experiences, including a dust storm that almost blew us off the highway. We learned that cattle have the right of way on the road! The next day, we continued our journey, driving through the desert and the mountains. We visited the Great Sand Dunes, Pagosa Springs, and Yellowstone National Park. We saw many amazing sights, including wind farms, bear habitats, and the Four Corners Monument.

As we drove, we encountered some challenges, like traffic jams and construction delays. But we also had some unforgettable experiences, like watching a bear cross the road and having a close encounter with a park ranger. We stayed in a cozy hotel with no internet or cell phone service, but the views were breathtaking.

In the end, we realized that you don't need to go to a foreign country to have an amazing vacation. It was bittersweet to be back home, but we had some great memories. I even got to enjoy my brother's company for most of the trip, without any fights!

Rose Frost was 16 years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy. Rose's parents were separating for two years, and her father was going to be away for work. Her mother would join him, but Rose and her older sister Amy would stay in England. Amy was finishing her school year and would live with the college Head, so it would be unfair to make her move. Rose's grandmother, Daisy, had offered her a place to stay, and Rose's parents agreed. Rose hadn't seen her grandmother much before, but she had happy memories of their times together. Daisy was a social person who loved to bring people together, and Rose was looking forward to living with her. Rose's parents had a disagreement with her grandmother in the past, but Rose was excited to get to know her better.

Before moving, Rose's parents had a talk with her about what to expect. Rose was responsible and knew how to take care of herself. She wanted to be independent and make her own decisions. She wanted to be able to play her music loud, invite friends over, and go out without needing permission every time. Her grandmother agreed, and Rose's mother gave her a new phone with a video camera for emergencies. Rose was happy that they had agreed to trust each other. If either of them did something that didn't work out, they would talk about it and adjust.

Rose was excited to start a new school in five weeks. It would be her fourth school in five years, but she was used to it. She knew this would be her last school, and she was looking forward to making new friends and starting a new chapter in her life.

Charlotte Grainger's teacher suggested that she might write a novel when she was still in primary school. Charlotte thought it was a big challenge, but she decided to give it a try when she turned 13. Her novel is now being published. She recently told her old teacher about it, and the teacher was surprised - she thought Charlotte would wait until she was 30 or 40 to publish a book.

I met Charlotte at her publisher's office. She's 15 years old and her book is very good. The story is exciting and well-written. Charlotte doesn't need help from her parents or a professional editor. She's a confident and intelligent person who knows what she wants.

Charlotte wrote about complex moral issues in her book, but she says she was just asking questions, not giving answers. She thinks that teenagers are often shown in a bad light in fiction, as outsiders, naive people who don't know about the world, or awkward people who can't fit in. She wanted to write about a character who is fine, without any flaws. Charlotte is a big reader and likes fantasy books, but some of them made her feel like she couldn't write a good book. However, she found a book called How Not to Write a Novel helpful, which told her that if readers can guess what's going to happen, the suspense is lost.

It might seem like Charlotte's parents, who are both journalists, helped her get her book published, but she says it's also important to have talent and a bit of luck. She's grateful for her good fortune, but she knows that ultimately, writers succeed or fail based on their own abilities.

'As we looked down the ski slope, our instructor, Gareth, reminded us, ""Speed is your friend, not your enemy."" He asked who wanted to go first. One guy, David, who had some experience with freestyle ski-jumping, volunteered. He skied down the slope fast and flew up in the air, but lost his skis and fell into the snow. Gareth told us that speed can be unpredictable. I had always thought freestyle skiing looked fun, but I wasn't sure I was good enough. On previous skiing holidays, I had enjoyed making turns in the snow, but I didn't try freestyle tricks like the teenagers who spent their time in skateboard parks. My parents decided we would have a winter holiday at a freestyle skiing training centre in the US. The centre had an indoor facility with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students practiced their moves indoors and then went outside to try them on the real slopes. Gareth said that before this centre was built, inexperienced ski jumpers would just ski down the slopes and hope for the best. But now, they learn how to control their jumps and land safely. The key is to hit the landing zone, not the flat section behind the jump. I found it hard to convince my body to go fast and control the jump. I kept stopping short and falling onto the flat section. Gareth told me to control the jump, not let it control me. The next day, we practiced on trampolines. I expected to hate being indoors, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. We did drills to teach us how to control our movements in the air. Gareth gave us feedback, and I realized I needed to work on my ""aerial awareness"". We went back to the mountain and tried again. It took some time, but I finally landed properly. Gareth was happy, and I felt proud. But then I lost my skis again.'

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. Your heart is racing, and you're holding on tight. The ride comes to a stop, then slowly moves up again. You pause for a moment before plummeting down, feeling your stomach drop. You might even scream with excitement. But why do people love rollercoasters so much? Amusement parks are a huge industry, and behind the scenes, there are many experts working together to create thrilling rides. These experts include engineers, designers, and marketing specialists.

Rollercoaster designers are responsible for creating a perfect balance between excitement and safety. They need to make sure passengers are safe while also keeping them thrilled. This is a big challenge. The designers also need to come up with new ideas to keep visitors coming back for more. Did you know that most of the techniques used in rollercoasters today were invented a long time ago? In the past, designers were able to create more extreme rides, but now they have to work within certain limits.

I spoke to three experts in the field. They told me that the key to creating a great rollercoaster is to balance the ups and downs. They need to make sure passengers feel like they're being thrown around, but also kept safe. It's a fine line between thrill and discomfort.

Rollercoaster designers need to create a strong story or theme to go along with their ride. This could be a space adventure or a jungle chase. They need to make sure the ride fits together seamlessly. However, experience and trial-and-error are just as important as any technical skills. In fact, designers need to be thrill-seekers themselves to understand what passengers want.

I asked the experts if they think rollercoasters will change with new technology, like virtual reality. They said that while technology can add to the experience, the physical rollercoaster ride will always be the main attraction.

I made minimal changes to the factual content to ensure that the questions associated with the passage remain answerable.

Miranda Ellington is a successful choreographer at 25. She creates works for many theatres and dance companies. She still dances occasionally, which reminds her of the challenges of being a dancer. As a choreographer, she enjoys teaching and working with young students. They are open to new ideas and willing to take risks. Working with students is easier than with professionals, who have a clearer sense of their strengths and weaknesses.

Miranda focuses on the dance steps and music when creating a new piece. She believes that even if she doesn't like a particular piece of music, she should still create a good dance routine to accompany it. Sometimes, dancers may not respond well to a composer's music, but she needs to find a solution.

Miranda doesn't like to work for one institution for too long. She likes to establish new contacts and adapt her style to each new place she works. She avoids becoming too set in her ways.

We discussed a recent documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda thought it was a realistic portrayal of life in a dance company. She believes that the amount of work and dedication involved in ballet is underestimated by the public.

When asked what makes a great ballet or dance production, Miranda said that it's when all the elements come together - the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. She aims high, but knows that perfection is difficult to achieve. Sometimes, even with great dance steps, something else can distract from the performance.

Miranda has worked on a wide range of projects and doesn't like to be labeled as a specific type of choreographer. She wants to continue exploring different styles and genres.

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

I had a conversation with a friend who asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I agreed that TV is great, but why stay at home when there's so much to experience? This conversation inspired me to plan a unique four-day trip and even make a film about it. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, so I decided to take it on an adventure. I fixed the wheels and cables, attached seatbelts to my shoulders, and put my luggage on the seats. I slept on the sofa each night, even on the beach one night. Some friends joined me along the way, helping me pull the sofa and encouraging me to keep going. This was a new experience for me, as I've only gone on foot expeditions before. This one was longer and took me on main roads, so I could stop at cafes and relax on the sofa with a coffee. When people asked me about my trip, I'd say, ""I'm not doing it for charity or training for a marathon, I just wanted to do something different."" Now, I'd rather talk about my sofa adventure than the latest TV show.

When I read about guided swimming trips around small Greek islands, I got excited. I'd never done a group trip before, so I decided to join one. My brother was busy, so I thought it would be a good idea to go with a group. At the port, the man was surprised when I asked for a single ticket, as the islands are usually popular with families. I explained that I'd be joining a group of ten others to swim around the tiny islands. He still looked a bit puzzled, but he showed me on board with a smile. Before we set off, we exchanged emails as a group, but there wasn't much time to chat before our first swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would be with us throughout, and taught us how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to split into speed groups, then it was time for our first 1.5 km swim. I was a bit nervous, as I'd never done long swims in the open sea before. The waves got bigger, and I found myself at the back of the slow group. I watched the faster swimmers ahead and felt a bit frustrated. But I was determined to complete the distance on my own. I was relieved when I finally did it. The next days followed a routine: jumping in, finding a comfortable speed, and stopping to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, I got faster and enjoyed them more. I didn't really need the support boat anymore. I'm already looking forward to going back next year.

At the summer camp where I work, I love seeing the children achieve things they never thought they could do. Most children know how to swim and play table tennis before they come here, but rock climbing is new for them. Some kids feel nervous, but after encouragement, they try and eventually reach the top. This makes them feel great. Some children miss home at first, especially those aged 10-13. We don't let them use their phones all the time. We allow them to call home after lunch, and then only once more after dinner. Most kids adjust in a couple of days and by the end of their stay, they thank us for a great time. It's not just the children who feel lonely. We also get parents calling non-stop, asking about their child's progress. Sometimes their child is busy, so we ask them to call back later.

'Rock the Planet, a musical show that combines acting and music, opened in London last year. It was previously performed in the USA for five years and won 'Best Musical' four times. However, casting an all-British cast was challenging. In the UK, young actors are limited to a certain number of performances per week, whereas in the USA, they can perform more often. As a result, twice as many actors were needed for the London production. Fortunately, the director found many talented UK-based actors, and the show has just won its first 'Best Musical' award. Despite the larger theatre in London, the show has been sold out every night, with audiences eager to hear the popular songs that originated in the USA. I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the young actors, who plays the guitar. He told me that it's great to get paid for doing something he loves. Jamie and the other young actors have a busy schedule, with daily school lessons at the theatre. Although they have a good teacher, Jamie misses his old school friends. The show's popularity has been boosted by special deals on tickets for schools, with many students attending and enjoying the show. Jamie's parents come to watch him perform when they can, but it can be expensive. When I mentioned that I also play guitar, Jamie offered me his spare guitar and we played a song together. I was impressed by Jamie's skills and wished I had similar abilities. Although the young actors were already musicians, none of them had played in a band before. However, they found it easy to adapt. The only challenging part was appearing natural on stage when they first performed together. They were concentrating so hard that they forgot to smile! The show will continue to run in London for another year, and it's definitely worth seeing.'
