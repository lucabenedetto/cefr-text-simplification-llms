Some time ago, a website warned people about sharing their whereabouts online. The site said that when you post where you are, you're also telling everyone else. This can be a problem because not everyone is someone you want to meet. This is one of the downsides of sharing everything online.
The internet has many great opportunities, but it also has its dangers. We can share our lives with the whole world, but we have to be careful. Some people have learned this the hard way. A long time ago, a group of pioneers started sharing their lives online. They got into trouble, lost friends, and even got fired from their jobs.
One of these pioneers was a student named Justin Hall. He started posting about his life on the internet in 1994. He shared everything, from his thoughts to his photos. He even wrote about his relationships and his feelings. But one day, he had to take down his website because his partner didn't like it. This is a problem that many people face today.
Another example is Heather Armstrong, a young woman who worked in a software company. She wrote about her job on her blog, but an anonymous colleague sent the link to her bosses. She got in trouble and lost her job. This is what can happen when we share too much online.
The article is saying that the internet is not a separate world where we can be ourselves without consequences. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and we have to be careful about what we share. We can say anything online, but that doesn't mean we should.

Some scientists were worried about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? It's a mix of documentary and drama that shows how little we know about the universe. Scientists can't know everything, but some were upset about the film. They thought it was misleading and didn't provide enough evidence for some of its claims. The film says that water molecules can change shape when people think about them. This sounds amazing, but the evidence shown in the film is just some pictures of ice crystals that look different depending on the mood of the person talking to them. Many people find this convincing, but scientists want more proof.
The truth is that scientists are still discovering many new things about the universe. They've found that the universe is made of a type of matter that we don't know much about, and it's being pushed by a mysterious force called ""dark energy"". On a smaller scale, scientists have found that our brains can't process events as they happen, and we only become aware of them a half-second later. They've also found where modern humans came from and why they left their home to populate the world. Some scientists even think that the design of the universe is connected to the existence of life on Earth.
Despite what some people think, science is still a long way from understanding everything. In fact, we're getting closer to realizing that many things can never be fully understood. This has led some scientists to try to create a single theory that explains everything in the universe. For many of us, the universe is just incredible."

Writing novels is a big challenge, but writing short stories is a joy. It's like planting a forest versus a garden. Both are important and help me grow as a writer. When I finish a novel, I like to write some short stories. And when I finish a group of short stories, I want to write a novel. I never write short stories while writing a novel, and never write a novel while writing short stories. This helps me focus and makes my writing better. 
I started writing short stories in 1984. It was a new experience, but I enjoyed it. My first short story collection was called Tales from Abroad. I like writing short stories because they are quick to finish. It usually takes me a week to write a decent short story. This is different from writing a novel, which takes months or even years. Writing short stories is a change of pace and helps me stay fresh. I can write about small things, like an idea or an image, and see where it takes me. If the story doesn't work out, I don't worry. I can learn from my mistakes and use them in my next story. My short stories are like small footprints I leave behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are like guideposts to my heart, and I'm happy to share them with my readers.

Science is a complex subject that has both helped and harmed us. It has made our lives easier, but it has also caused problems. Scientists have tried to understand the world and the universe, but they still have a lot to learn. Sometimes, new discoveries replace old theories, and this can cause conflicts. Scientists are not always agreed on what they think they know. This book is about the ideas that have changed the way we think about science and the world. We will look at these ideas and consider their beauty and limitations. Science is always changing, and sometimes this leads to big changes in how we understand the world. Some people think that science is not good at explaining the world, but it has helped us make predictions and understand nature better. In the past, scientists thought they had already discovered everything, but then new discoveries were made. Today, scientists are working on a new theory that might explain everything. Science is important because it helps us control nature and make decisions about the future. We should pay attention to what scientists are doing because it affects our lives and the future of our planet.

'The sale of ebooks has slowed down in recent years. Some big publishers are even saying that ebook sales are falling. This has made people wonder if ebooks will replace print books. One person in the publishing industry said that the hype around ebooks might have led to bad decisions, and that their company lost confidence in the power of printed books. Despite this, many people still think that ebooks will replace print books. But the truth is that digital and print books can coexist. We still use both. This idea of one medium replacing another is not new. We've seen it with TV, radio, and the internet. People have always been worried that new technology will make old technology disappear. But usually, old technology finds new ways to stay popular.
We have a strong emotional connection to the things we use every day, like books, TVs, and computers. When a new technology comes along, it makes us think about what we used to have and what we're missing. This is why we often see a new appreciation for old things, like old books and their smell. We also like to tell stories about how technology changes our lives. We use stories to make sense of change. The story of the death of the book is a good example. It's a story that shows how we feel about new technology and how we're afraid of losing things that are important to us.'

For a year and a half, I woke up every weekday morning at 5:30. I brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and sat down to write about how famous people throughout history managed their daily routines. I wanted to find out how they made time for their work, how they organized their days to be creative and productive. By looking at the daily habits of these people, I hoped to get a better understanding of their personalities and careers.
I believe that knowing what someone eats and when they eat can tell you a lot about who they are. I think that knowing someone's daily routine can also reveal a lot about their personality and work habits. This book is about the daily routines of famous and successful people, not just their final products. It's about how they managed their time, not just what they created.
I wrote this book because I struggle with the same issues in my own life. I want to know how to balance my creative work with my daily responsibilities. I want to know how to make time for everything I want to do. I don't have all the answers, but I hope to provide some examples of how other people have handled these challenges.
I wanted to show how big ideas can be broken down into small, daily tasks. I wanted to show how a person's daily routine can affect their work and vice versa. The title of my book is Daily Rituals, but I focused on people's daily routines. A routine can be ordinary and uninteresting, but it can also be a powerful tool for getting things done. A good routine can help you make the most of your time, energy, and optimism.
This book was inspired by my own procrastination. One day, I was supposed to write an article, but instead I spent the day tidying my office and making coffee. I started searching the internet for information on how other writers work. I found some interesting stories and decided to collect them in a blog. The blog was popular, and now I've turned it into a book.
I've tried to keep the book concise and diverse, with quotes from the people I'm writing about. I've also included a list of sources in the back of the book, so readers can learn more about the people and their routines."

Howard became interested in palaeontology when he was six years old. His family couldn't afford a holiday to Spain, so they went to the English coast instead. On the beach, Howard found an ammonite, a type of fossil. He knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist and, as he finished university, he decided he wanted to focus on the earliest times. He didn't like the flashy parts of the job, like dinosaurs, but he loved studying small creatures on rocks.
After completing his PhD, Howard worried about finding a job. He applied for a position at Tavistock College in London, but wasn't sure if he would get it. On the day of the interview, the professor who was supposed to chair the panel got into a fight with his wife and was late. The interview went ahead without him, and a colleague who didn't like Howard got him the job. Howard was surprised, but happy to have the job.
Howard found that his professional life was organized and predictable, but his personal life was chaotic. One day, his briefcase with important notes was stolen at a train station. He had to cancel a lecture and report the theft to the police. Later, he met a colleague who told him about a new collection of fossils at the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. This was an opportunity Howard couldn't miss, and he quickly changed his plans to visit the museum."

Charles Spence is a professor at Oxford University who studies how we experience food and drink. He thinks that the way we eat and drink is not just about the taste, but also about the surroundings and the company we keep. For example, eating with others can make us eat more. He has written a book about this called ""The Perfect Meal"".
Spence's lab is not high-tech, but he can still work with cooks and food companies to study how we eat. He gets funding from a big food company and has even worked with famous chefs like Heston Blumenthal. He has discovered some surprising things, like how music can affect what we taste. For example, higher-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched music can make it taste bitter.
Spence's work is helping food companies make healthier food without changing the taste. He is also working with airlines to match music with food on planes. His family has fun trying out his experiments at home, like eating rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery or playing with different sounds and lights while drinking different drinks.

Our brains are working harder than ever before. We're bombarded with information, fake news, and distractions, and we have to sort through it all to find what we need. At the same time, we're doing more things ourselves. Thirty years ago, travel agents would book our flights and salespeople would help us find what we needed in stores. Now we do most things ourselves. We're doing the work of 10 people while still managing our daily lives, families, careers, hobbies, and TV shows. Our smartphones help us do all this, but there's a problem. We think we're multitasking, but our brains aren't good at it. We're actually switching between tasks quickly, which can be tiring for our brains. This can make us less efficient and even stressed.
In fact, research shows that multitasking can increase stress hormones and make it harder to focus. Our brains can get easily distracted, especially by new things. This means that the part of our brain that helps us focus can get sidetracked. Just being able to multitask can make us less good at thinking and learning.
Some experts call this ""info-mania."" They say that having too much information and trying to focus on one task while doing other things can reduce our intelligence by almost 10 points. Even trying to learn new things while multitasking can make it harder to remember and understand.
Making decisions is also hard on our brains. Even small decisions can take up a lot of mental energy, and too many decisions can make us tired and confused. We might even make bad decisions because of it.
Many business leaders, scientists, and writers agree that email is a big problem. It's not the email itself, but the huge amount of communication we receive. We feel like we have to respond to every email, but it's hard to do that and get anything else done.

Some animals, like chimps and bats, do things that seem like they are trying to help each other. For example, a chimpanzee named Santino in a Swedish zoo used to break up concrete to throw at visitors during the day. Was he being mean or helpful? Some animals, like female bats, help other mothers who are having trouble giving birth. Are they being kind or just doing their job? 
Fifty years ago, scientists thought animals just did things without feelings or thoughts. But now, scientists are studying animal behavior and emotions. They are even writing books about it. This has started a big debate: can animals really think and feel like humans do? 
A recent experiment with cows showed that they enjoy solving problems. If cows can open a gate to get food, they seem to be happy. This makes us think about where we get our food and whether it's right to eat animals. 
Some scientists say we should stop eating meat because animals have feelings and thoughts. Others say we should just learn more about animal behavior and not make assumptions. 
The debate is not just about science, but also about what is right and wrong. It's a big question that may never be fully answered.

'Thinking critically is important when we read or listen to something to understand it better. Adrian West, a researcher, says that people used to think that arguing was a way to find the truth. However, technology is changing the way we think. We are exposed to more information, but this can make it harder to think clearly. West says that we are often overwhelmed by too much information and opinions.
Reading is becoming less popular, and some people think this is affecting our ability to think critically. Patricia Greenfield, a professor, says that we are spending too much time on visual media like video games and TV, and not enough time reading. This can make it harder to think deeply and make good decisions.
Technology can be both good and bad for our thinking. For example, a computer game can help us think critically or make us think less critically. Reading on the internet can help us analyze information, but clicking on too many links can make it hard to think deeply.
James Paul Gee, a professor, says that video games can be a good tool for learning. They can help us develop important skills like decision-making and analysis. He believes that we should not think that video games are always bad for kids. In fact, they can be very helpful.
It's important to understand how technology affects our thinking and analysis. As reading and math scores are declining, we need to take a closer look at technology and how it affects our minds.'

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic who used to work in offices. He writes books about how we should live. His latest book is about the problems of modern life. He noticed that we're constantly being interrupted by advertisements and messages on our phones. This makes it hard for us to think and remember things. We're also less likely to talk to strangers because we're always trying to avoid distractions.
Crawford thinks that we're losing the ability to focus on what's important because we're too busy looking at our phones. He says that we're more aware of the things we could be doing, but we're not doing them because we're too busy staring at screens. This is not a new problem - people have been worried about it since the invention of the telegraph.
Crawford thinks that technology has made it easier for us to avoid dealing with real people and things. We'd rather send a text message to a friend instead of talking to them face-to-face. He gives the example of a gym where people used to listen to music together, but now everyone listens to their own music on headphones. This has made the gym a less social place.
Crawford suggests that we need to find ways to engage with the world in a more meaningful way. He thinks that doing things that require skill and attention, like cooking or playing sports, can help us do this. These activities force us to focus on the present moment and deal with the world around us. When we do this, we can see that manufactured experiences, like video games or social media, are not as satisfying as real experiences.
Crawford's solution is to find ways to use our judgment and pay attention to what's important. This can be tiring, but it makes it easier to focus on what matters."

'What do you do for a living?' It's a common question, but it's not always easy to answer. When you're a philosopher, it's even harder. Saying you're a philosopher can sound pretentious, like you're trying to be special or superior to others. But this isn't true. Philosophers are just people who think deeply about the world and try to understand it. They're not better than anyone else.
The idea that philosophers are special comes from ancient Greece, where philosophers like Aristotle and Socrates were respected for their wisdom. They believed that thinking deeply about the world was the most important thing you could do. Today, people still think that philosophy is about being smart and thinking deeply, but it's not just that. It's about looking at the world in a new way and trying to understand it.
Some philosophers have become too focused on their own special ideas and don't talk to anyone else about them. This makes it hard for people to understand what philosophy is really about. But philosophy is actually very practical. It's about looking at the things we do every day and asking if they're really important. It's about thinking about what we believe and why we believe it.
As an ethicist, I study how we should behave and what is right and wrong. But I think there's more to philosophy than just making rules. I think it's about exploring big questions and thinking about how we live our lives. By doing this, we can learn more about ourselves and the world around us.

'Food is an important part of our lives, and many people enjoy thinking about what and how we eat. However, philosophers haven't always talked about food in a serious way. Instead, they have used food as a metaphor for other topics, like learning. Sometimes, they discuss food, but only to make a point about something else. 
One ancient Greek philosopher, Epicurus, believed in enjoying life and avoiding pain. He didn't just talk about food, but about all aspects of life. Today, his name is often associated with a love of eating and drinking, and even restaurants and food shops use it to make their products sound appealing.
Food is also a social and cultural thing. The food we eat comes from our community and is often shared with others. This is why food is an important topic for philosophers to explore. 
When people write about food, they often talk about how it tastes. But, surprisingly, there isn't much written about how we perceive the taste of food. This is an area that needs more attention. 
Food can also be beautiful, like art or music. Some people think that, with the rise of modern cooking, food has become an important part of aesthetic discussions. However, food is eaten and destroyed, unlike art, which can be preserved and admired over time. 
There are also many ethical questions about food, such as what we should eat and why. Philosophers will always ask these questions and explore the answers. 
Finally, food can bring people together, whether it's in a restaurant or at home. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests, while professional chefs have obligations to their employers and the food itself. Food can even help bridge cultural gaps by bringing people together to share meals and learn about each other's cultures.'"

Rob Daviau, an American, designs special board games called 'legacy' games. He wanted to make games more exciting and challenging. He thought, 'Why can't games have a story? Why can't our choices affect the game in the next session?' He created a new version of a classic game called Risk, called Risk Legacy. In this game, players make permanent changes to the board. They might tear up cards, draw on the board, or open new rule packets. The game is played over several sessions, and players can see the results of their choices.
Daviau was asked to help create a legacy version of another popular game, Pandemic. Players work together to cure diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall. Players become sailors and explore the world. Legacy game designers need to think about all the possible choices players can make to make the game exciting and fun.
To test the game, designers play it many times to see how it unfolds. One tester, Jaime Barriga, said it takes a lot of time and effort. 'You have to play the game many times to make sure it's fun and exciting.'
Daviau didn't expect legacy games to become popular. He thought it would be a niche idea. But many players loved the concept. One player, Russell Chapman, said it's the biggest advance in game design in years. 'It's exciting to learn new things and make new choices,' he said.
Another player, Ben Hogg, said the appeal of an unfolding adventure is more important than worrying about the game's longevity. 'It's like watching a TV series,' he said.
Pandemic creator Matt Leacock compared the legacy design process to writing a novel. 'You need to plan the beginning and end, but also be flexible,' he said. Daviau wants to see where others take the idea, but he's also excited to play the games himself.
Colby Dauch, a game publisher, thinks the legacy format has changed the way we think about board games. 'It's a new way to experience a game,' he said."

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at a zoo in New Zealand. He climbed out of the water, crossed the floor, and squeezed into a small drain that led to the ocean. This story was shared online and was very popular. People enjoy imagining that animals are like us, and octopuses are especially interesting because they are very smart and have bodies that are very different from ours. How can octopuses open jars, recognize faces, and even play games? Some scientists think that we don't give animals enough credit for their intelligence. They say that we often think animals are not as smart as we are, but this is not true. Animals can do many things that we thought were unique to humans, such as thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding what others are thinking. Octopuses, for example, can solve problems and even play with toys.
In the past, people thought that animals were very intelligent and could be put on trial for crimes. Even Charles Darwin, the scientist who discovered evolution, believed that the difference between humans and animals is just a matter of degree, not kind. However, in the 20th century, some scientists thought that animals were just machines that responded to stimuli or had useful instincts. This changed how people thought about animals and how they treated them. Now, scientists are learning more about animal intelligence and how it is similar to human intelligence. They are designing tests that are specific to each species and its abilities. For example, squirrels can remember where they hide nuts, but they might struggle with human memory tests. An octopus might test humans on their ability to change color like an octopus does.
The story of Inky the octopus is a good example of how people are becoming more interested in animal intelligence. The scientist who wrote about Inky is skeptical about whether Inky really escaped on his own, but he thinks that the story can help people appreciate how smart octopuses are."

'Robots are changing the way we work and live. They are no longer just machines that can do simple tasks. Experts say that robots will soon be used in many areas, including healthcare, education, and even our homes. This change will be big and will affect many jobs. Some people think that robots will take over many jobs, but experts say that this is not necessarily true. They believe that robots will create new jobs that require special skills, such as programming and maintenance.
A company in Australia has developed a robot that can lay bricks faster than a human. A robot in a supermarket in the US ensures that shelves are stocked and priced correctly. Robots are getting smarter and more efficient, and they will soon be able to work alongside humans.
Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert on robotics, says that robots will have a big impact on the job market. He believes that many people will need to retrain to adapt to the changes. He also thinks that robots will create new opportunities for companies that are prepared to take advantage of this shift.
In the future, we can expect to see robots that can walk and talk like humans. This will change the way we live and work. It is important that we prepare for this change by investing in education, particularly in subjects like science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM).'

'Why do people climb mountains?' This is a question that has puzzled many. Some people might think it's crazy to risk their lives to climb a big mountain. But for climbers, it's about the adventure and the fun. Climbing can be a way to challenge yourself and feel free. It's like playing a game with rules, and the way you play depends on the game. Some people love climbing because it makes them feel alive. But it can also be scary and confining at times. For example, being stuck in a tent during a storm is not very liberating.
Some people think that climbing is in our nature. We have always climbed and will always climb. It's a way to test our limits and push ourselves. Others believe that climbing helps us develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. It can also help us develop virtues like perseverance and self-reliance.
Climbing can be done in different ways, and some people prefer to do it alone. They have to be very committed to their goal to succeed. This can be a big challenge, but it can also be very rewarding.
Climbing is not just about the physical activity, but also about being in the moment and feeling connected to nature. It's like a form of meditation. Some people even think that climbing can help us reach a state of perfect peace, like in Zen philosophy.
When we ask why people climb, we can consider all these different perspectives. It's a complex question, but it's an important one to explore.'"

Alfred Brendel was a famous pianist who performed classical music for many years. He was a serious and focused person who loved to play and record music. Brendel didn't teach many students, but he was impressed by a young boy named Kit Armstrong when he asked for lessons. Kit was only 14 years old, but he played the piano very well and even recorded a CD of his own music. Brendel was impressed by Kit's talent and agreed to teach him.
Kit is now 19 years old and is still learning from Brendel. He is a hard worker and likes to learn new things, such as languages, math, and computer programming. He also likes to play tennis and compose his own music. Brendel says that Kit has a great memory and can play the piano very well. He is also very good at listening to his own playing and can make changes to improve it.
Brendel is careful not to put too much pressure on Kit, as he doesn't want him to get too stressed. He says that Kit is still young and needs time to develop his skills. Brendel himself is now 80 years old and has stopped performing, but he still loves music and is happy to share his knowledge with Kit.

When I was a child, I thought all gardens were beautiful and peaceful. My grandfather's garden was special because it was near a river. You couldn't see the river, but you could hear the water and the birds singing. I thought all gardens were like this. My grandfather's garden wasn't very big or fancy. He didn't have a greenhouse like some of his neighbors, who made their own greenhouses from old windows. My father was a quiet person, but he had a good sense of humor. He liked to say funny things, like ""It's immaterial to me."" He was never very ambitious, but he was good at fixing things around the house. My parents moved to a new house only once, but my mother liked to buy new furniture. One day, they got a piano, but I was never allowed to play it. My sister took lessons instead. When I asked my mother why I couldn't play, she said I wouldn't have practiced. I liked to go to the river with my fishing net and imagine I was in another world. I would walk along the riverbank, looking for a good spot to take off my shoes and put my net in the water. I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father said there was a job opening for an apprentice gardener.

We're walking down the hill when he points to another island, Eigg, and says it gets a lot more rain than we do. We're going to move his sheep. He tells me some interesting facts about the island, like how it's volcanic and has been home to his family for 3000 years.
As we move the sheep, his dog, Tie, isn't doing a good job. Lawrence is not happy. The island is a family business. His wife, Jenny, helps with the farm, his son manages the cottages, and his daughter runs the hotel. They love that their boys can play outside and sail on the summer days.
Life on the island can be challenging. We don't have electricity all the time, and there's no mobile phone signal. But we make do. One evening, I'm waiting for the lights to turn on, and the next morning, Mary is setting out breakfast by torchlight. I get used to it.
The island is a special place. We have a concert with some musicians who come by boat. Everyone enjoys it. That night, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny.

'In the past, the video game industry was not easy to get into. People thought it was just a hobby for young people. But now, the industry is growing and taking itself seriously. To work in this industry, you need a lot of skill, patience, and hard work. Jim Donelly, a games expert, says that it's difficult to get a job at a big company, but there are still opportunities. He says that the industry needs people who can design games, not just those who can make big decisions. 
To get into this industry, you can try making your own games. Jim says that the tools are available and that you won't get a job if you haven't made something. Another expert, John Field, agrees that making games is important, but he thinks it's more complicated than that. He says that there are many people who want to work in games, but few who have the skills and talent needed. 
Can you make it on your own? John says it's difficult, but a good course can help. Most people start by working as programmers or artists and then move up the career ladder. They are interested in all forms of entertainment and have a good understanding of the arts. They may have worked for a few years before deciding that games is what they want to do. 
Finally, connections can help. It's important to network and make connections in the industry. The stereotype of the teenage boy playing games has changed, and now games are enjoyed by people of all ages. Smartphones have made it easy to play games and social media has made it easy to connect with others who share the same interests. John believes that there is still plenty of room for growth and that games can be a great way to learn new things.'

When I score a goal from far away, people say it's just luck, but I've worked hard to improve my skills. The best players in the world have natural talent, but they also practice a lot. I think it's important to enjoy learning new skills.

When I started my professional football career, our manager helped us younger players move up to the first team, but he didn't make a big fuss about it. We knew we had to work hard to succeed. We lost our first game, and a famous TV presenter said we couldn't win anything with young players. That made us more determined to prove ourselves.
I rely on my close friends and family, but having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. People sometimes say I should help my parents financially, but I think they would be offended if they felt they were on the payroll. My mum loves her job as a hairdresser, and I like using my money to make things easier for the people around me.

We lived at Reef Point because of Sam Carter, my father's agent in Los Angeles. My father and Sam worked together, and Sam found a cheap place for us to live. This was because my father couldn't write well when we were in Los Angeles. The beach at Reef Point was not popular with tourists because the road was not nice and there was a nicer place nearby. But in the summer, more people came to the beach. My father was working hard to write a script, and I would often go to the beach with my dog Rusty. Rusty was a stray who liked to dig and bring things to me. Sometimes, he would find things that didn't belong to him, and I would have to give them back to their owners. Rusty loved the beach and swimming. He would always swim with me, even though he wasn't very good at it. One day, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver the script, and Rusty and I spent the day swimming and watching the surfers. There was one surfer who was very good, and she talked to me after her last wave. She asked me why I didn't join the surfers, and I said I didn't have a surfboard. She suggested I could buy one, but I didn't have the money. She asked if my father was American, and I said no. She had heard of my father, Rufus Marsh, because he wrote a famous book called ""Tall as the Morning"". She read the book and was interested in talking to me.

Violet Hetherington stood in a long queue at the dock in Southampton. She was waiting to board the Queen Caroline, but the queue wasn't moving. Her friend Annie had told her to arrive late, but it seemed that was bad advice. Suddenly, an announcement came over the loudspeaker: there was a problem with the computer system. The atmosphere among the passengers became gloomy. Some people were getting impatient, but others tried to stay calm. They had paid a lot of money for this trip, and they wanted it to be perfect. Violet was feeling frustrated. She had lost her phone, which meant she couldn't contact the taxi company to see if she had left it behind. She couldn't even ring her son Harry to ask him to help her. She was worried about being stuck in New York without a phone. A nice couple behind her in the queue offered to let her use their phone to call her son. Violet left a message asking her neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was at her flat. She was relieved that Kristina could help her. Eventually, the queues started moving, and Violet went to the window to hand over her documents. She was disappointed when she saw the ship's foyer. It looked like a fancy hotel, but not as nice as she had expected. Violet followed the signs to the elevators, which were decorated with mirrors and crowded with passengers. She was squashed in the lift, but finally reached her room on the 12th floor. She was relieved to find that it had a balcony, which was what she had wanted. She had paid a lot of money for this trip, and she was determined to enjoy it.

Eleanor Catton is a young writer who has written a big book called The Luminaries. It's a murder mystery set in New Zealand in the 1860s. The story is very complex, with 20 main characters and over 800 pages. Eleanor wanted to give each character a chance to be important in the story. When I asked her how she felt about being successful at such a young age, she said it's nice because people in her small country feel proud of her. She also said that some people assume her book is not deep or meaningful, but she wants to show that it is.
Eleanor told me that she wrote the book in a special way, with each part getting shorter as the story goes on. She wanted to create a book with patterns that readers could find if they looked closely. The book is exciting and has a good plot, and Eleanor said she didn't plan it out beforehand. She just wrote herself into a difficult situation and then tried to get out of it. She also wanted to make the book fun to read.
I asked Eleanor if she would like to write for TV, and she thought it could be cool. She loves talking about her writing and New Zealand. She said that when she comes to Britain, she notices that her imagination changes because of the different landscape. But for now, she will stay in New Zealand, which inspires her to write more books.

'Jonny Kinkead has been making guitars for over 40 years. As a boy, he loved playing the guitar and building things with his dad's tools. He learned to play his brother's guitar when he was 11 and then wanted to learn the bass guitar. Jonny was always interested in how things work and how to make them better. He studied guitars and learned how to make different sounds by using different types of wood.
After school, Jonny went to university to study architecture, but he didn't finish the course. He realized that he was too individualistic and wanted to do something more creative. He started building guitars and selling them, but it wasn't easy. He had to work part-time jobs to make ends meet and it took him a while to get his guitars known.
Now, Jonny is one of the best guitar-makers in the UK. He thinks that it's easier for new guitar-makers to develop a career today because people recognize the quality of UK-made guitars. He believes that taking courses is important, but also thinks that trial and error is the best way to learn. He learned by trying different things and making mistakes.'

'Talking about the weather is a common topic in English conversations. Many people start their conversations with a comment about the weather. This is because, as the famous writer Dr. Johnson said, 'When two English people meet, their first talk is of the weather.' This is still true today. However, many people try to explain why English people talk so much about the weather, but they often get it wrong. They think that English people are really interested in the weather. But that's not the case.
The American writer Bill Bryson thinks that the English weather is not exciting or interesting. He says that there are no big storms or dramatic weather events in England. On the other hand, the English broadcaster Jeremy Paxman disagrees. He thinks that the English weather is fascinating because it is always changing and unpredictable.
My research shows that both Bryson and Paxman are wrong. Talking about the weather is not really about the weather at all. It's a way for English people to talk to each other without feeling awkward. We use phrases like 'Nice day, isn't it?' or 'Ooh, it's cold!' to start conversations or fill gaps in the conversation. These phrases are like a secret code that helps us feel more comfortable with each other.
There are certain situations when we use this code. We might use it as a greeting, to break the ice and start a conversation. We might use it to fill a silence or to move on from a difficult topic. It's easy to see why people might think that English people talk about the weather all the time, but really, it's just a way to be friendly and polite.'

Alice Leader is a teacher who loves history and writing. She took her students on a trip to Hadrian's Wall in Britain to show them how amazing the Romans were to build a wall 120 km long and 5 meters high 1900 years ago. The students were curious about why the Romans built the wall. Alice wanted to find a good book to help them understand, but she couldn't find one. So, she decided to write one herself. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started writing novels in 2001. She liked writing more than teaching because it's less tiring. Alice's goal is to write books that are fun and interesting for children. She wants to show them that there's more to life than just negative or fantasy stories.
Alice used to teach English and History together. She loved seeing students go from being bored to being interested in learning. Now, she writes books that make children want to read more. Alice started writing because she wanted to fill a gap in children's books. She was inspired by a suggestion from her head teacher and a course she took. She wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby-to-be and got great feedback from her fellow students. With the help of her husband, who is a critic and editor, Alice was able to finish her first novel. He helped her make the story better by changing the sentence structure and suggesting new ideas.

'Two brothers, Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, are famous triathletes. They decided to take part in a special race to raise money for charity. The race was between a car and a bike, and the brothers were competing against each other. Jonny drove a car on the roads, while Alistair rode a bike across the countryside. They started at a beautiful lake in Yorkshire and had to finish at the highest road in the area.
Jonny was excited to be in the car, saying it was nice and warm inside. Alistair was dressed in warm clothes and was confident he would win because he had seen Jonny drive before and wasn't sure he would make it. The race was challenging, with steep hills and narrow roads. Jonny got stuck behind a tractor, while Alistair had to get off his bike and carry it up a hill. But Alistair was determined and kept going.
In the end, Alistair reached the finish line first, and Jonny was disappointed. He said he was gutted to lose to his brother.'

'When I play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, I notice the silence. I bounce the ball on the soft grass, and it makes no noise. I serve and hit the ball, and I hear the echo of my own shot. The quiet of the court helps me focus on my game. I try to ignore everything else and just think about the match. The silence is broken by applause and cheers when a point is finished. I hear them, but it feels like they're coming from far away.
I've always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My coach, my uncle Toni, told me it was the biggest tournament. When I was 14, I thought about playing there one day and winning. Before 2008, I played and lost to Roger Federer twice. The second time I lost, I was very upset. I knew I could have done better. My coach told me not to cry, that there would be other chances.
I'm a professional athlete, and I know my career is short. I want to make the most of it. I had a second chance in 2008, and I was determined to do better. The night before the final, we didn't talk about the match at dinner. I was already thinking about it in my head, and I wanted to keep it to myself until the match started.'

'A young English woman named Jane Goodall went to Africa in 1957. She was very excited to be there and wrote to her family, 'I am living in the Africa I have always dreamed of.' Jane spent most of her life in Africa and became a famous scientist, journalist, and activist. She is known for her work with chimpanzees.
In 1963, a well-known magazine and TV channel made a big deal about Jane's research on chimpanzees. She wrote books for children and adults, and one of her books became a bestseller. Many people know Jane Goodall because of her work, but some people think that her fame has hidden what she really achieved.
Jane Goodall is a very important scientist. She spent 40 years studying chimpanzees and found out many new things about them. Before she started her research, people didn't know that chimpanzees ate meat, used tools, or had emotions like humans. She also found that chimpanzees have their own cultures and communities, just like humans.
Jane Goodall's book about chimpanzees is considered the most important book on the subject. Her work changed the way scientists study animals and helped people understand more about themselves. Even when Jane was a child, she showed signs that she would become a scientist. When she was five, she hid in a henhouse to see how hens lay eggs. This might have been the start of her career as a biologist.'

Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist. She can speak in many different voices. She talks to me like a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, an old Scottish woman, and even a fast-talking alien. She has done many voiceovers, including ones about back injuries. She has to learn to pronounce medical terms quickly.
Shirley says that many actors think they can do funny voices, but it's not just about that. You have to bring the script to life for people who can't see you. Many famous actors want to do voiceovers, but they often don't get the parts because they're used to acting with their whole bodies.
Shirley studied drama and started doing voiceovers by accident. She got a big part in a cartoon and realized she was good at it. She learned to create different voices and sounds from the back of her throat. She collects new voices by watching children's TV and cartoons.
Shirley has worked on many projects, from educational videos to vacuum cleaner ads. She says the trick is to smile while talking, which makes her voice sound bright and cheerful. She loves working on animation projects because it's like a holiday.
The competition for work is tough, but Shirley says it's important to have a good showreel, which is a recording that shows what you can do. She recommends attending specialist workshops and having a passion for sound and voices.
Shirley is very good at her job and has worked hard to get where she is. She loves her job and is obsessed with voices. Sometimes, she even talks like the characters she's performing for hours or days afterwards. Her children are used to their mum talking in different voices."

People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a job that many people dream about as kids, like being a pilot or a doctor. But most people give up on these childhood dreams and choose more realistic careers, like being a lawyer or an engineer. It's hard to believe that someone can make a living by drawing simple doodles, but some people do it. 
I'm one of those people. I always loved drawing and making comics as a kid. I even drew for my school newspaper. After college, I studied graphic design and then started showing my work to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted my cartoons. I drew a few ideas and they liked them, so I started selling them. It's not necessary to have a university degree or a lot of money to become a cartoonist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to draw with. 
Of course, it's not easy. There are many people who want to be cartoonists, so you need to be good at what you do. I've done many different types of cartoons, like political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also been a writer, a caricaturist, and a designer. 
The business side of being a cartoonist is important. In the past, many cartoonists had regular jobs drawing for newspapers and magazines. But now, most cartoonists work for themselves. That means you need to be good at selling your work and finding new customers. I've seen many cartoonists who are not very good at drawing but are very good at business do well. 
Some people worry about someone stealing their ideas, but it's not a big deal. You just need to put a little 'c' for 'copyright' on your work and you're protected. If someone does steal your work, it might even be a good thing! It could make your work popular and help you get more customers."

Twenty years ago, I moved house and got rid of many things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. I didn't know why I wanted to get rid of it, but I did. I took it to the dump and was about to throw it away when a young man asked me if I was sure I wanted to get rid of it. I said yes, but then felt bad. He asked if he could have it and I said okay. Later, I felt sad about getting rid of it.
Years later, I received an email from someone who restores guitars. He said he had found my guitar and wanted to sell it back to me. I was surprised and happy. It turned out that the man who took it from the dump had sold it to someone else, and it had been passed around. The guitar had a label on the back with my name on it, so the man was able to find me.
I had forgotten that my dad used to put labels on everything I owned, including my guitar. My parents had wanted me to learn classical guitar, but I didn't make much progress. I switched to electric guitar and played simple songs. When I took the guitar out of the box, I remembered my 16th birthday and how happy I was to get it.
I picked up the guitar and felt comfortable playing it. My fingers knew what to do, and I felt like playing. The electric guitar is not a solo instrument, so I might need to form a band. My son is learning the saxophone, so maybe we can play together. Or maybe there are other people who have had a similar experience to mine. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers""!

Sleep is an important topic that has been discussed a lot lately. I wrote a book about people who have trouble sleeping and the effects it has on their minds, bodies, and moods. When I interviewed people who struggle with sleep, they told me that sleep is crucial for their well-being. It's great that people are finally paying attention to sleep. But I think we should also talk about dreams. We often cut off the last hour or two of sleep when we wake up early, which means we lose a lot of our most vivid dreams. These dreams can be very powerful and memorable. Researchers have found that when people don't get enough REM sleep, they make up for it the next night. This means that dreams are important. In the past, people thought that dreams were a way to understand the mind, but now we know that they are more about the physical workings of the brain. 
Dreams can be useful for creative people like actors, writers, and directors. A study found that these people are better at remembering and using their dreams. It makes sense that filmmakers need to use their dreams, since film is a very imaginative medium. But I think that everyone needs to use their dreams, not just creative people. We all need to think creatively and come up with new ideas. Dreams can help us do this by bringing together things we know and creating new connections. For example, a researcher found that when people are woken up during REM sleep, they come up with more original ideas than when they are woken up during other stages of sleep. I find that I write better when I wake up after a good dream. Even a bad dream can give me ideas and help me think more clearly. We all need to think creatively, so we all need to dream."

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London and moved to a small town in the south-west of England. She has a studio with a beautiful view of the sea. The walls are filled with empty frames and photos of her two daughters. You might expect to see many of her own paintings, but they're all gone as soon as she finishes them. This is because she's very good at copying famous paintings. She's been doing this for 30 years and has copied many famous works by artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that art experts often think they're the originals.
Susie's clients are mostly galleries and private collectors. Some of them buy her copies because they love art, while others do it to show off. She doesn't reveal the names of most of her clients, but she says that some famous people even pass off her copies as originals. However, Susie is honest about what she does. She makes sure her copies are as good as possible, but she always signs her name on the back of the canvas.
Some people might think it's strange that Susie doesn't create her own art. She's very good at copying, but she's not sure if her own paintings would be as good. She has tried to create her own art, but it didn't turn out well. She thinks it's like trying to cook a meal after a lifetime of eating at a top restaurant. Susie is a perfectionist and is happy making a good living from copying famous paintings.

Jordan Romero is 13 years old and wants to climb Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. If he succeeds, he will be the youngest person to do so. Jordan's parents, Paul and Karen, are also climbers and are helping him on his journey. They want to inspire other young people to go outside and be active.
Jordan has already climbed five of the Seven Summits, the highest points on each continent. Climbers who have climbed Everest before think that it's not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb the mountain. They say that a young person might not be emotionally strong enough and might not have enough experience to make good decisions.
Jordan's parents know that people might be worried about their son's safety, but they are experienced climbers themselves and are careful to consider the risks. They also think that Jordan is becoming stronger and more responsible every day.
I asked Jordan why he wants to climb Everest, and he said that he just wants to achieve his goal. His father, Paul, said that they don't want to make a big deal out of this just for the sake of being famous. They want to make sure that Jordan still enjoys climbing and doesn't get too caught up in trying to set records.
If Jordan decides that he no longer wants to climb mountains, his parents will stop the project and focus on other activities, like playing basketball.

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's unlikely they're listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but ask someone if they know who Brahms was and they might not know. I'm studying music, but my friends and I don't know much about classical music. If you don't know who wrote the music, you're unlikely to buy their recordings. The statistics are not good for classical music. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells only 300 copies.
I think classical music just doesn't appeal to most people, especially teenagers. Some people blame TV and video games for this, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is that classical music is not interesting to many people. I know some teenagers who love classical music, but they are a minority.
As a musician, I play in an orchestra, but I'm not a big fan of classical music myself. I like many types of music. So, why don't teenagers like classical music? One reason is that classical music is slow and complex, and we like fast-paced music. We also have trouble paying attention for more than a few minutes, which is too short for most classical music. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music requires time and concentration.
Pop music also deals with topics that are more interesting to teenagers than classical music. Classical music is powerful, but it doesn't talk about the things that worry us. The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would make music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Nowadays, you can find any music you want on the internet, and classical music is not a big part of our lives.
I don't know why people like classical music more as they get older, but I do know that if your parents like something, you're less likely to like it too. Some people think that schools are to blame for the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers, but there are many kids who enjoy playing classical music in school. They come early to practice and stay late to rehearse. Classical music is their favorite when they perform, but it's not their usual choice. The two things have become separate. When we want to relax, it's usually pop music we listen to.

There were signs saying 'Science block', 'gymnasium', and 'riding centre'. Bonnie saw the sign for the riding centre and got interested. Her mother saw it too and said, 'This way.'

'I've met Cody Simpson before and I'm impressed by his calm confidence. He's a 15-year-old Australian who has already released many popular songs. So, how did a relaxed surfer boy end up performing in front of thousands of fans? 'I started playing the guitar when I was six and writing songs when I was seven,' Cody says, remembering how it all began. 'But I was also swimming and surfing a lot. Those were the things that mattered most to me back then. I was 13 and in high school, and then I posted some videos online.'
These videos changed everything. He started with a video of himself and a friend singing at a school concert. Fans asked for more videos, so Cody recorded some more at home. The response was amazing. Cody was a good swimmer and was training with top coaches. But then record labels contacted him, and he had to make a difficult choice: stay in Australia and keep swimming or take a big risk and move to the US with his family. Cody decided to take the risk. 'It was hard for me - especially at such a young age - to choose a career for myself. Can you imagine trying to figure out what you want to do for the rest of your life at 12 or 13?' He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was moving to the States. 'It was a big surprise for most people. I'm a quiet person,' he says, remembering their shocked expressions.
Cody packed his bags and moved to the US with his family, giving up one dream to pursue another. Although his family keeps a low profile and isn't involved in his career, they're always there for him. Cody says it's important to surround yourself with good people to stay grounded. We all have doubts sometimes. 'Sometimes when I'm alone, I think about how my decision affected my little brother and sister. My little brother is eight and travels the world, doing school on the road. He doesn't have a regular life,' Cody admits. 'I worry about that sometimes, but my family always reassures me that they're here to support me.'
Success comes from being brave and taking risks. 'It all happened so fast and unexpectedly,' Cody says. 'Now, I'm going to countries I never thought I'd visit and performing in front of thousands of fans. It's like something many people dream of and try to achieve. But I know it won't last forever.'

I woke up early and went to the window. I lifted the curtain and looked out at the river. The ice was melting and there was a crack in it. I could see the wall of sandbags to protect the buildings from flooding. I remembered helping to put them there last week. My grandfather didn't seem to care that I did a good job.
I looked at the river and saw a dark patch of water where the factory's pipe was releasing warm water. I was getting ready to go kayaking. I put on my wetsuit and checked my lucky chain, which my grandfather brought back from a trip to South America. I also have his diary, which I keep under my pillow.
I went to the kitchen to get a banana. My mom was making breakfast. She reminded me to be careful on the river. I said goodbye and headed out to the boathouse.
As I was leaving, I bumped into my grandfather. He was grumpy and asked where I was going. I told him I was going kayaking. He said I didn't need to train because I didn't win the competition. I ignored him and went to the boathouse.
My mom came out and told me not to mind my grandfather. He's been acting strange lately. I tried to be patient with him because I used to look up to him. I want to be like him when I grow up and have my own adventures."

Mum took Jess by the arm and said, 'Come with me.' Jess followed her to the study and saw a painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa's, but it was different from his other paintings. It was a river, but not a real one. The riverbank was very small and green, and the water was pale and seemed to go on forever. There were no animals, birds, or people in the picture. Jess was fascinated by it. Mum said, 'It has a name.' Jess didn't know what to make of it. Grandpa never gave his paintings names. Mum turned the picture over and showed Jess the words 'River Boy'. Jess read them out loud. 'River Boy' seemed important, but she didn't know why. Mum said, 'There's no boy in the picture.' Jess was surprised. Grandpa never did that. Mum had asked him about the painting, and he said it was strange to give it a name. He said that artists don't need to explain their paintings to everyone who looks at them. He said that each painting has its own life and its own language, and people either understand it or they don't. Mum said she was hoping Jess might know something about the painting because Jess was like a muse to Grandpa. A muse is someone who inspires an artist. Jess knew what the word meant, but she didn't think Grandpa meant her. She thought he meant a goddess or a mythical creature. She didn't think anyone could inspire Grandpa, who was a very independent person. 'He doesn't need me to inspire him,' she said. 'He's been painting all his life.'

""The TV series 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live in the walls and floors of a house. They take things from the normal-sized people to survive. When I directed the TV series, I knew it would be hard to please everyone who loves the book. I used the original drawings from the book to make sure it was right. The author wanted the series to be from the Borrowers' point of view, not from a human's. This made filming tricky. The Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so we had to film them from far away. When we filmed the big people's surroundings, we had to crawl on the ground. We never used high cameras except for special shots. One big challenge was making the shadows look right. We developed a special way to do this. After the series was finished, a famous director, George Lucas, called me to ask how we did it. We built a special set for the Borrowers' home under the floorboards. It was strange but fun. The actors had to carry big things like scissors and coins, which made the crew laugh. In one scene, the Borrowers go down a drain. The actors had to be swept down a tunnel and said it was scary. I wanted the costumes to look like doll clothes, so they were heavy and stiff. This made it hard for the actors to move. The weather was hot during filming, and the actors didn't like the costumes. Most of the scenes were filmed with the actors separated from their surroundings. We used a blue screen and I drew pictures of each scene to show the actors what to do. I drew 2,000 pictures in total! It was a lot of work, but the series turned out well and people liked it.""

My mom drops me off at my new school, Palm Grove High. She looks around nervously, making sure there are no journalists. I tell her everything will be fine. She kisses my cheek and leaves me to start my new school. I wanted to leave my old life and tour tutors behind. I want to meet normal kids, like those with parents who work 9 to 5 or cut grass. I walk into the school office and ask for my schedule. The secretary is not very friendly. I tell her my name is Desert McGraw. She types it into the computer and gives me my schedule. My first class is English Literature. I'm a little late, but I know the way to the classroom. I take a deep breath and go in. The teacher is already taking roll. I slip into the last desk and try to look normal. The girl next to me smiles and says my shoes are nice. I look down and realize I shouldn't have worn them. She introduces herself as Becca. We start talking and I tell her my dad is an artist. She doesn't seem interested. I'm happy to have someone to talk to, even if she doesn't care about my dad's job.

'American teenagers have a lot of responsibilities. They are expected to do well in school, have a part-time job, volunteer, and be active in their communities. It's not enough to just get average grades; they need to excel in all areas. Many people think that teenagers are lazy, selfish, and reckless, but this is not always true. Teenager Kristen Loose says that people often assume that they spend too much time on their phones and TV, but this is not the case. She uses her phone to stay organized and connected with others, not just to text her friends. Many teenagers have to work hard to balance their schoolwork, extracurricular activities, jobs, and family responsibilities. They often get very little sleep and have to wake up early to do it all again the next day. Despite the pressure, many teenagers are involved in volunteer work and try to make a positive impact in their communities. Teenager Lindamarie Olsen says that she focuses on volunteer work and helping others, not just on her own interests. She believes that the stereotype of teenagers as selfish and lazy is not accurate. Who knows what the stereotype will be in 20 years, but teenagers will continue to prove it wrong and make a difference in the world.'

'The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in Bishop, a mountain town in the US. They launch balloons into space, around 35 km above the Earth's surface. They do this as a science project, but it's also an adventure. They want to record shooting stars, which are bright lights in the sky when a rock or piece of metal enters the Earth's atmosphere.
One weekend, I joined them to launch a new balloon. They put a camera, an instrument to measure altitude, and a thermometer inside a special box attached to the balloon. They also put GPS trackers on the outside to find it later. The balloon grew bigger and bigger until it was as big as a small car.
When it was time to launch, they counted down and the balloon went up. Some of them followed it with flashlights, shining it in the moonless sky. They were all quiet and felt a sense of wonder. Then the balloon disappeared.
After the launch, most of the students went home, but some stayed to watch the shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountain and looked at the very clear sky. I saw a boy fall asleep in his sleeping bag. 'We're the only ones talking,' said one girl. 'I know,' whispered another.
As the balloon went up, it got thinner air and got bigger and bigger until it popped. A parachute helped the box come back down safely. The students would find it the next day using the GPS trackers.
Getting it back isn't easy, but that's part of the fun. The lunch box often lands in the middle of nowhere, so they have to drive or walk to get it. On this occasion, it took them 11 hours to find it. It was in a canyon, high on a rock, near a waterfall. The camera didn't record any shooting stars, but they could talk about the effects of atmospheric waves and how they work above mountain ridges. And they had a new story to tell.'

Chloe Morgan didn't like science or palaeontology when she was younger. But when she was 15, she helped her younger brother with a school project and read an article about dinosaurs. She was amazed and decided to learn more. She met a professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was kind and patient with her questions.
Chloe thinks that movies and TV shows often show palaeontologists in a bad light. They are usually portrayed as weird or boring people who don't know how to talk to others. But Chloe's job is actually very varied. She digs up dinosaur bones, studies fossils, and writes articles. She also has to explain science to the public.
Chloe believes it's important to help young people understand science and appreciate the natural world. She likes to talk to children about dinosaurs because it can make them interested in other areas of science too. Recently, she worked on a TV documentary about dinosaurs and was happy to see that it was accurate and showed how much we've learned about dinosaurs.
Chloe thinks that dinosaurs are still fascinating because they are unknown and exciting. They remind us that there is still much to discover and learn. Palaeontology is a way to travel back in time and learn about the past.

And when you finally get there, it's not ""there"" anymore, it's ""here"". So, you should ask ""Are we here yet?"" instead. I'm sure parents get tired of answering ""Are we there yet?"" over and over again. In fact, being in the back seat can be quite comfortable. You can watch movies, listen to music, or do some puzzles while looking at the nice views outside. And your parents will take care of everything, like giving you snacks and drinks. But sometimes, things can get a bit crazy. My brother, Tim, would sometimes put his foot on my side of the seat, and then we would fight. Our parents would have to stop the car and separate us. After that, we would calm down and the scenic views would continue. Sometimes, I would try to read a book, but then I would feel a cold breeze on my arm. It was coming from my brother, who was sitting next to me and blowing on me on purpose. I got angry and we had another fight. Our dad has some strategies to deal with us kids on the back seat. For example, he would say ""We're here"" when we asked ""Are we there yet?"", even when we were still on the highway. That would keep us quiet for a while. You know you're finally ""there"" when the grown-ups get out of the car and go away from us kids who have been bothering them for hours. So, remember: if your parents are still near, the answer is ""no, you're not there yet"".'

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and play board games. They want to create a place where people can socialize and have fun together, away from their phones and screens. The games they play are called 'Eurogames' and are known for being friendly and fun. The first game of this type was 'The Settlers of Catan', where players build settlements and trade resources. Another popular game is 'Pandemic', where players work together to solve problems. The game designer, Matt Leacock, was inspired by a game called 'Lord of the Rings' and wanted to create a game that would bring people together. He was frustrated with games as a child, so he started designing his own. The growth of video games has actually helped the popularity of board games, as people are now more open to playing games with others. Some people who used to play video games online are now looking for ways to play with others in person. John and Zuzi's café is a popular place where people can do just that.

'In the UK and other countries, there has been a big change in education. Now, students are encouraged to start doing research early on in their studies. This is because research is not just for famous scholars or scientists. It's a way to build knowledge and skills that can be useful in many areas of life.
Research is about asking questions and finding answers. It's not just about memorizing facts. Instead, it's about thinking critically and finding out why things are the way they are. As a student, you make a contribution to knowledge by asking questions and finding answers.
You might think that research is only for experts, but it's something that everyone can do. You probably started doing research when you were in school, asking questions and finding answers for projects and assignments. You also do research when you're planning a trip, fixing something around the house, or shopping online.
In college and university, you'll be expected to ask questions, explore ideas, and find your own answers. This might seem challenging, but it's an important part of learning. You need to be able to question what you read and hear, and think critically about the information you're given. You can't just accept everything you're told as true. You need to think about whether it makes sense and whether it's backed up by evidence.'

Cities have always been important for intellectual life. People gather in cities to discuss ideas and share knowledge. For example, in 18th-century London, people met in coffee shops to talk about science and politics. In modern Paris, artist Pablo Picasso shared his ideas about art in a café.
However, city life can be difficult. The same coffee shops that sparked interesting discussions also spread diseases like cholera. Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. Cities can be overwhelming and unnatural places.
Scientists are studying how cities affect our brains. They have found that cities can make us less clever and more tired. One reason for this is that cities lack something that is good for our brains: nature. Studies have shown that patients in hospitals recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even a short glimpse of nature can improve our thinking.
Most people now live in cities, which is a big change from the past. We used to live in wide open spaces, but now we are surrounded by concrete and many strangers. This can affect our mental and physical health.
Cities are full of things that require our attention, like busy streets and confusing traffic. This can be exhausting because our brains have to work hard to process all the information. Natural settings, on the other hand, are less demanding and can actually help our brains relax and recover.
Philosophers and architects have long warned about the negative effects of cities and have tried to find ways to include nature in urban design. Parks, like Central Park in New York, provide a break from city life and can improve our brain function.
Despite the challenges of city life, cities are still important for creativity and innovation. In fact, the same features that make cities overwhelming can also lead to new ideas and discoveries. The key is to find a balance between the benefits and drawbacks of city life.

'Where is the mind? This might seem like a strange question. We usually think that thinking happens inside our heads. And we have special machines that can show us what's happening in our brains. But I think we should look beyond our skin and skull. There is a lot of evidence that shows that things, not just our brains, play a role in how we think. For example, in the past, people used stones, tools, and other objects to help them think and make decisions. These objects are not just tools, but also a part of our minds. I want to suggest that what's outside our heads is not necessarily outside our minds.
It's easy to see why we often think of the mind and brain as the same thing. Scientists have studied the brain by taking people away from their normal surroundings. But this can make us forget that a lot of our thinking happens outside our heads. I'm not saying that our brains aren't important, but I think we should also consider the role of the things around us in how we think.
I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). It looks at how we use objects to help us think and how these objects have changed over time. For example, a blind person using a stick is not just using an object, but is also changing their own mind. The stick becomes part of their body, and they use it to feel the world around them. This shows us that our minds are not fixed, but can change and adapt as we use new objects.
I think this is important because it shows that our minds are not just inside our heads, but are also connected to the world around us. We use objects to help us think and make sense of the world, and these objects can change our minds in powerful ways. This is what I call metaplasticity - our minds are constantly changing and developing as we use the world around us.'

Photography has had a huge impact on the way we see the world and how we understand it. In the United States, photography became a big part of American culture, both in practical and artistic ways. It's even been called the country's greatest contribution to the visual arts. This is because photography has become a central part of American intellectual and artistic discussions.
So, why was photography so popular? One reason is that it was a new technology that matched the growing enthusiasm for innovation in the United States. Just like how trains, electricity, and steam power made the world smaller, photography brought the world into people's living rooms. Another reason is that photography was a way to show off one's identity, especially in a country where people believed in reinventing themselves. The camera also helped people create and keep memories of their families, often in an idealized way.
Photographs are unique because they are records of what was in front of the camera, making them seem objective. However, they can also be subjective because they are taken by a specific person with their own perspective. This is why photography has been called a ""universal language"", but its meaning can be complex and influenced by the context in which it is seen.
Today, artists often use photographs in their work, and photography has become an essential part of art. In the past, artists like Andy Warhol used photographs in their work, and now it's common to see photographs used in various ways in art. In short, photography has become an important part of art, not separate from it.

William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the'science of mental life' in 1890. This definition is still relevant today. We all have thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and we can understand our own mental life. However, studying psychology is not easy because it's difficult to know exactly how our minds work. James believed that psychology is about understanding human thoughts and feelings, which are unique to each person. We can't directly observe our own thoughts and feelings, but we can observe how others behave.
Psychologists try to understand why people behave in certain ways. They use scientific methods to gather information and make conclusions. It's like solving a puzzle. They observe people's behavior, take notes, and then try to figure out what's going on in their minds. This is a challenging task because our minds are complex and hard to understand.
Psychologists have been studying the mind for a long time. In the past, they relied on self-reflection to understand mental processes. However, this method has its limitations. Today, psychologists prefer to study the behavior of others to understand the mind. This approach is more accurate and helps them develop theories about human behavior.
The goal of psychology is to describe, understand, predict, and change human behavior. By doing so, it can help us understand ourselves and others better. Psychology has many practical applications, such as improving education, designing safer machines, and helping people who are distressed.

'In a storehouse in Michigan, USA, there is a special collection of failed products. It's like a museum of products that nobody wanted to buy. The owner, Carol Sherry, thinks each product has a sad story behind it. The most surprising thing is that this museum makes money. Many companies don't keep failed products, but the people who come to visit this museum are proof that it's rare. The museum's owner, Robert McMath, started collecting products in the 1960s. He thought he was creating a library of new products, not failed ones. But most products fail, so his collection became mostly unsuccessful products.
This might be because of the culture of optimism in business. Companies don't want to admit when a product fails, so they keep trying to make it work. Marketers might even spend more money on a failing product to make it look like it's doing well. The culture of optimism is also seen in the self-help industry, where people are encouraged to imagine a positive future. But research shows that thinking positively can actually make people less motivated to achieve their goals. A psychologist, Gabriele Oettingen, found that people who think about how well things could go actually do worse. Another psychologist, Carol Dweck, says that people's experiences of failure depend on what they believe about ability. Some people think ability is fixed and can't be changed, while others believe it can be developed through hard work and challenge. Dweck thinks that believing ability can be developed is a happier and more successful way to live.'

Sports teams usually do better when they play at home. But why is that? Many people think it's obvious, but experts are now questioning this idea. Two groups are looking into this: scientists and people who make money from sports. Scientists want to know what makes players perform well, while the money-makers want to know why home advantage is important. They think that if players are paid well, they should feel comfortable playing anywhere.
Some fans might think that if their team plays some games in a different country, it wouldn't matter. But the fans who go to the games at home are important to the team. They create a loud and energetic atmosphere that can help the team win. In fact, fans often remember that when they cheer and shout, the team scores a goal. But they forget about the times when the team doesn't score.
One thing that scientists have found is that referees are influenced by the crowd noise. They are less likely to make decisions against the home team when they hear the crowd cheering. This is because referees don't want to make the crowd angry.
Experts have also looked at how home advantage has changed over time. They found that it's not as big an advantage as it used to be. In the past, teams used to win about 70% of their games at home, but now it's around 60%. One reason for this is that travel has become easier and more comfortable for players. But despite these changes, home advantage still exists.
The mystery is why home advantage is bigger in some sports than others. For example, basketball and football have a big home advantage, but baseball doesn't. One reason might be that team spirit is important in team sports like basketball, and playing at home makes players feel more confident. In individual sports like baseball, players are more focused on their own performance.
Some researchers have also found that players' testosterone levels increase before home games. This might be because they feel a strong desire to defend their home turf. This feeling is similar to the one that drives players to fight hard in competitions like the Rugby World Cup.
Overall, home advantage is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by many factors."

'Gary Player, a famous golfer, said, ""The more I practice, the luckier I get."" This phrase is often repeated by athletes and coaches. But what does it really mean? Some people think it means that the more you practice, the better you get. But Player was actually saying the opposite: ""The more I practice, the better I get, up to a point."" This idea is connected to a bigger question: is talent something you're born with or can you learn it? 
Many experts think that practice is more important than talent. A psychologist named Anders Ericsson said that with 10,000 hours of practice, anyone can become an expert in anything. This idea is popular in books and articles. But some people disagree. They think that there are other factors that affect how good someone is, like their genes, environment, and support. 
A writer named Epstein looked into this question and found some interesting examples. He talked to people from different countries and even looked at animals, like sled dogs in Alaska. He found that sometimes the drive and desire to do something well can be influenced by genes. This makes the question of whether talent is born or acquired even more complicated. Epstein thinks that both hardware (your natural abilities) and software (what you learn) are important. He also talks about how race and gender can affect someone's abilities. He asks, ""If practice is the only thing that matters, then why do we separate men and women in sports?"" Sometimes the best questions are the most obvious.'

Many children in rich countries feel unhappy and lonely. A writer named Jay Griffiths thinks she knows why. She believes that children today are spending too much time indoors, looking at screens, and not enough time playing outside. She thinks this is the main problem. This idea is supported by other experts who have talked to children about their unhappiness. The children said they would be happier if they could spend more time outside.
Some adults remember their own childhoods fondly, when they had more freedom to play outside. They would spend hours exploring, swimming, or playing in woods and fields. They think this was better for them than the protected life children have today. However, these same adults are the ones who are now keeping their own children indoors, worried about the dangers outside. They are the ones who are buying their children lots of toys and gadgets to keep them entertained at home.
Griffiths writes that the fear of danger that makes parents want to keep their children indoors is actually helping the toy and gadget industry. She also criticizes the way some schools are prescribing medication for children who are restless or fidgety, or making them wear protective gear to play.
Griffiths is a passionate writer, and her ideas are inspiring. However, she sometimes goes too far and ignores the other side of the argument. She also has a romanticized view of children, thinking they are naturally curious and adventurous. But in reality, children can be difficult and challenging to manage.
The main idea of the book is that children should be allowed to have freedom and autonomy, to explore and take risks. Griffiths believes that children need to learn to manage risk by experiencing some danger. However, she doesn't explain how to achieve this, and it's not clear if all children would want to follow this model. What about children who are naturally timid or cautious? Maybe the biggest mistake we make is trying to make all children fit into the same mold."

I'm a psychologist who has studied a lot. I'm good at solving problems, but this isn't because of my education. Most problems in life can't be solved with formulas or memorized answers. They require good judgement, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. For children, these experiences come from playing. I'm studying the importance of play for children's development. All mammals, including humans, play when they're young. Children who have the most to learn play the most. They learn important skills like thinking creatively, getting along with others, and controlling their emotions through play. These skills can't be taught in school. They're learned through play.
Creativity is important for success. We need people who can think creatively and solve new problems. This requires the ability to think creatively. Adults who are good at thinking creatively are like children who never lost their sense of play. Albert Einstein, a famous scientist, said that his education almost stopped him from being interested in math and science, but he recovered his interest when he left school. He called his work ""combinatorial play"".
We can't teach creativity, but we can stop it by making school too serious and focusing on what teachers think is important. It's more important for children to learn to get along with others and care about them. Children are born with a desire to play with others and this is how they learn social skills and fairness.
Unfortunately, schools have become more strict. Children have less free time, more homework, and more pressure to do well. Outside of school, adults often supervise children's play, which means children don't have the freedom to make their own choices. This has happened gradually, but it's had a big impact. It's caused by a combination of factors, including parents' fears and the idea that children learn more from adults than from each other.
Our children don't need more school. They need more play. If we care about our children and the future, we need to give them back their childhood. We need to let them play and explore so they can grow into strong, capable adults."

'Many young people in their twenties are using social media to find a job. Sites like Twitter and LinkedIn help them connect with potential employers. But, with great power comes great responsibility. A young jobseeker in the US sent a message to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn, asking for help. The executive was not happy and sent a rude response that went viral. This incident shows that social media can be a double-edged sword for jobhunters. On one hand, it can be a great tool for finding work. On the other hand, it can also be a way to make mistakes.
Many young people use social media for personal reasons, like sharing photos and updates with friends. But, when it comes to using it for professional purposes, it's a different story. Some people don't understand the difference and make mistakes. For example, they may send impersonal messages or come across as arrogant. This can harm their chances of getting a job.
To use social media successfully for job hunting, it's important to be clear and respectful in your messages. Explain who you are and what you can offer to the person you're contacting. Don't send blanket emails and keep your tone humble. Remember, social media can be a powerful tool, but it needs to be used carefully.'

Newspapers are in trouble. Since 2000, many UK national newspapers have lost between a third and half of their readers. In the US, only 26% of people now get their news from newspapers, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people think that newspapers will disappear completely within 15 years. But history shows that old media often survive. For example, books, theatre, and cinema have all survived despite new technologies.
Newspapers were once new media, but it took a long time for them to become popular. This was because it was difficult and expensive to produce news for a large audience over a wide area. Important was the idea that everything is always changing and we need to stay updated. Now, we expect change, but in the past, people thought that life was cyclical and that the most important truths were recurring.
Journalism as a job didn't exist before the 19th century. Even then, there was no reason why most people needed news regularly. Online news is different. We can read what we want, when we want. We can correct mistakes quickly and access more information. But instead of using this to spread understanding, many news providers focus on being the first to report the news and creating a lot of noise.
In the past, news was often spread through markets or taverns, where truth and rumors mixed together. In some ways, we're returning to that world. Newspapers have never been very good at explaining how the world works. Maybe they will disappear, or maybe they will find a way to guide us to wisdom and understanding.

'If we were meant to live in the dark, we would be happy to go out at night without any problems. But we're not. We're diurnal creatures, which means we're used to living in the light of the sun. This is something we're born with, even if we don't think about it much. But because we're not used to the dark, we've found ways to make it brighter. We've filled the night with artificial light. This is like controlling a river. It has good and bad effects. The bad effect is called light pollution. This is because we design our lights badly, so they shine upwards and outwards, instead of downwards where we need them. This makes it hard for many living things, including us, to adapt to the darkness. Wherever we put our artificial light, it affects some things in nature, like migration, reproduction, and finding food. In the past, people didn't know about light pollution. Imagine walking through London at night, a long time ago. There were very few lights, and you would have smelled the city more than seen it. We've lit up the night as if it were an empty place, but it's not. There are many animals that are active at night. Light is very important for them. For some birds, artificial light is like a magnet that attracts them. This is why scientists say that birds can get ""captured"" by searchlights or the light from oil platforms. Some birds even sing at the wrong times because of artificial light. It used to be thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, who need to see the stars clearly. But it affects us all. We need darkness to be healthy. Denying ourselves darkness is like altering our body's internal clock. This can cause physical problems. Our bodies need to have a regular day and night cycle to stay healthy. So, we should not forget the importance of darkness. We are trapped by light pollution, just like frogs near a brightly lit highway. We have cut ourselves off from our natural and cultural heritage, the light of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. In a way, light pollution makes us forget our place in the universe, and the scale of our being, which is best measured against the vastness of the night sky.'"

""The founder of a big company has announced that they will no longer keep track of employees' holidays. This decision was inspired by a company that already does this. The founder says his daughter, who works in the company, suggested the idea. However, some people think this is just a way to make the company seem more friendly.
But is this a good idea? The company has 50,000 employees and many different departments, so it's hard to know if it will work. In a smaller company, it might be easier to know who is working and who is on holiday, but in a big company like this, it's harder.
The company's founder says that employees can take as much holiday as they want, as long as they are sure it won't affect their work or their careers. But it's hard to be sure about this. Even if you plan ahead, there is always a lot of work to come back to. This means that people might not take holidays at all, or they might feel guilty about taking them.
The company's policy could also lead to stress and pressure from colleagues and gossip about who is on holiday and for how long. This could make people feel like they can't take holidays, which is not good for their health and well-being.
Employment law exists to protect workers and give them time off to rest and relax. The company's policy might not be a good way to achieve this. I'm not sure if this policy is a good idea or if it will actually work.""

'Scientific research papers are reviewed by other experts in the same field before they are published. This process is meant to make sure that the papers are good and accurate. However, it can take a long time - up to a year - and some people think it's not worth the wait. There's a new way to share research papers before they are reviewed, called preprints. These are early versions of the paper that are put online for others to read and comment on. This helps to speed up the process and makes it easier for other scientists to build on the research.
Some people think that preprints are a good way to get research out to the public faster. They also think that it will help to make the scientific community more open and collaborative. However, there are some concerns about the quality of the research and the possibility of 'junk science'. But so far, this hasn't happened.
One scientist, Tanya Elks, used a preprint to share her criticism of another paper. She says that it was a better way to handle the situation because it allowed for open discussion and feedback. She also says that it's less worrying about the paper being rejected by a journal because the preprint will still be available online.
Preprints can also help to share negative results, which are an important part of the scientific process. And, interestingly, papers on preprint archives are read and cited more often than those published in journals. This shows that sharing research online can be very effective.'

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it's like a picture made with words. But I'm not satisfied with their answers. So, I asked them to write about an object in two different ways. One way was like a scientist would describe it, and the other was from the object's point of view, like it was a person. One student wrote about an oxygen mask, saying it's a device that helps people breathe in emergencies. This exercise was fun and helped us understand poetry better.
I didn't like poetry when I was in school. I thought it was confusing and got in the way of understanding and feeling. After school, poetry isn't something that grabs people's attention as much. Sometimes, you see a poem and it stands out because it's different from regular writing. You might feel disappointed or confused, but you still try to understand it.
What do we look for in poems? We want to find deep feelings, beautiful images, and interesting ideas. But we can find those things in other things, like movies, books, or music. Poetry is special because it can be ambiguous, like everyday life. An online dictionary defines a poem as a type of literary art that uses language in a special way. But the word ""poem"" comes from the Greek word ""poíema"", which means ""something made"". So, what kind of thing is a poem?
Poets compare poems to wild animals or machines, but these comparisons don't really work. The important thing is to think about what makes a poem unique. A poem can be like a song that gets stuck in your head. The combination of words and music can be powerful. A poem on a page can have a big impact, even though it's just words on paper. A poem is special because it's not just created to sell something, but for its own sake. That's why it can surprise us.

I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It was a lot of money, but my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first trip out. Over the years, I've found many other interesting things, like brooches and coins. But it wasn't until 40 years later that I found something that impressed Marion as much as the first ring. It was a rainy day and I had a few hours free, so I decided to search a spot near my house. My detector beeped, and I dug down to see what it was. At first, I thought it was just an old wheel, but then it beeped again. I was curious, so I kept digging. Finally, I saw a golden ball. I was excited, but I tried not to get my hopes up. As I cleaned it, it became clear that it was a beautiful, intricate necklace from ancient times. I knew it was very valuable and rare. I took it to the council office and they confirmed it was the Great Torc, a famous necklace from Iron Age Britain. They bought it from me and it's now in the British Museum in London. The money we got from selling it was split between me and the landowner. But the Torc has been more than just a lucky find for me. It's something I've saved for everyone. People ask me if I'll stop detecting now, but I don't think so. I'll keep searching because there might be something even more amazing to find tomorrow.

'Sleep is one of my favorite things to do while traveling. But I don't talk about it much because I feel a bit guilty. When friends share their detailed travel plans, I smile and don't say much. They plan every moment, from museums to hiking. My own travel plans are different. I like to leave some time for napping in the afternoon or sleeping in late in the morning. It's a great way to relax. When I was in Mexico, I slept a lot. It was amazing. I could sleep soundly, even with noisy birds outside. It was a big change from my usual sleep at home. When I'm traveling, I can sleep better because I'm not worried about work or alarm clocks. But it's not just that. I think sleep is part of the travel experience. When we travel, we see and experience new things. Our senses are filled with new sights, sounds, and smells. It's when we sleep that we process all these new things. That's why sleep is so important when we're traveling. It's also different in different places. In some places, people sleep a lot during the day, while in others, they sleep at night. It takes me a while to adjust to the local sleep patterns. But when I do, I feel like I've really arrived. I remember a time when I was in the Dominican Republic and I took a big lunch with some new friends. We ate a lot and then everyone went to sleep. I realized that it was a common custom in that country. I joined them and took a nap. It was a great experience. I love sleeping when I travel because I remember it so well. When I'm in a new place, I notice all the little things, like the smell of the air or the sound of the birds. It's a special part of traveling.'

We had been flying for many hours. When I woke up, I saw that it was already daytime. I looked out the window and saw a vast, empty landscape below. It was a mix of brown and green, which reminded me that it was still early September in Siberia. I didn't see any people or signs of life. The view went on forever, with mountains, rivers, and forests stretching out to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbour, Sergei, woke up and smiled at me. He was a salesman from Moscow who was going to sell safety clothes to mining companies in a very remote area. His English was not very good, but we used a dictionary to talk. I told him I was going to Magadan, a city in eastern Siberia, with only a one-way ticket. I wanted to ride my bike back to England. Sergei didn't believe me. ""But there's no road from Magadan,"" he said. I told him I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. ""Alone?"" he asked. ""Yes, just one friend,"" I replied. Sergei looked unconvinced. He pointed outside and said ""Holodna"" (cold). I showed him my warm clothes, but didn't mention that I was on a tight budget. I bought most of my clothes and gear at cheap prices. I was worried they might not be good enough.
This adventure started in a lecture hall in Scotland. I was thinking about a problem. Should I ask the lecturer or not? I wrote a note to my friend Al, asking him if he wanted to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China. Al was sitting in front of me, and I tapped him on the shoulder and passed the note. He wrote back ""OK"". It was six years later that I was going to join Al in Siberia.
I had been working as a geography teacher. I liked my job because it was challenging, interesting, and gave me long holidays to go on adventures. I had taken two holidays to meet Al since we went on a bike ride in Pakistan. Al had caught the adventure bug and decided to cycle around the world. He was setting himself bigger and bigger challenges. This trip was his biggest challenge yet. Sometimes he thought the ride would be too hard, but he was proving to himself that he could do it. He was having an amazing adventure and feeling alive."

'The Red Bull Air Race is a thrilling competition where 12 pilots fly their planes through a course of tall pylons, doing sharp turns, rolls, and loops at high speeds. I was lucky enough to try it out. Before the flight, I had to sign two forms and learn some important rules. The pilot told me to stay calm and focused, and to trust my instincts. I was also warned not to touch anything in the plane. As we took off, I felt my heart racing. The pilot, Dario, showed me how to fly the plane, and I got to try it for a few minutes. It was an incredible feeling! The plane was very responsive, and I felt like I was in control. But then Dario started doing some tricks, like barrel rolls and loops. I was a bit scared, but I tried to stay calm and enjoy the ride. After the flight, I was relieved it was over.

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who films animals in cold places. He loves filming in extreme temperatures, and his favorite temperature is -18°C. Doug used to be a marine biologist and commercial diver. He learned about survival in cold places while diving. His big break came when a TV crew asked him to help film a documentary in Antarctica. He became a wildlife cameraman because he loved traveling, adventure, and underwater work.
Doug has worked on many big TV wildlife series. He started filming 35 years ago, when camera and communication technology was not as advanced. ""It's much easier to film now,"" he says. ""We used to have to remember everything, but now we can shoot a lot and look at it immediately.""
Doug has a lot of experience filming in cold conditions. He has spent a lot of time on sea ice and feels comfortable in these environments. He says that wildlife filming can be very successful, but also has its failures and embarrassing moments. One time, he couldn't even identify the birds he was filming!
Recently, Doug went to a place called Kong Karls Land in the Arctic Ocean to film polar bears. It was a challenging assignment, with temperatures as low as -32°C and strong winds. After 23 days of filming, he finally saw a mother bear and her cub. On the 24th day, he felt like he was living in a world of polar bears, moving and sensing like they do. He was able to get some amazing footage of the bears.
Doug wants to make a new documentary about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experiencing the impact of climate change firsthand. He thinks he could make an extraordinary documentary."

Pen Hadow is a famous explorer. In 2004, he became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone and without getting any help. Eight months later, he walked to the South Pole too. Now, he's going back to the Arctic to do an even bigger expedition. This time, he'll be measuring the thickness and density of the ice with his friends. Nobody has done this before, and it's very important for scientists.
Pen was trained to be an explorer from a young age. When he was a child, his father's old nanny, who used to work for a famous explorer, would send him out in the cold with few clothes on to toughen him up. His father loved adventure, and Pen grew up to be very strong and able to handle the cold. He's married to a woman who loves horses and helps him with his business. They have two children, and it's hard for him to be away from them.
Pen is a bit worried about this expedition because it's more challenging than before. He's not used to being away from his family for so long, and he's also feeling a bit old - he's going to be 47 soon! He thinks his mission is important because it will help scientists understand what's happening to the ice in the Arctic. He believes that explorers like him can make a difference and be useful again.

I stayed fit so I could get back into training if I wanted to. I started doing marathons and triathlons. Then, my friend Ben Fogle asked me to row across the Atlantic with him. I loved rowing, but I wasn't sure if I was ready to commit to intense training. I talked to some fellow rowers, but they weren't interested. I decided to join Ben, even though I knew we wouldn't win. I thought it would be fun to be the underdog. We had to pay £70,000 for the boat and equipment. I also had to think about the money I would lose by being away from home. As a retired athlete, I make money by speaking at business conferences. But I need a new goal to talk about. This adventure would give me something to share. I learned a lot while preparing for the race. I realized how easy my life was as a professional athlete. My training was tough, but it was structured and I had help. I was worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter. But as we prepared, my concerns went away. The Atlantic Rowing Race is not just about rowing; it's about mental toughness. Ben had done some tough challenges, but he wasn't very good at rowing. I was surprised by how much I had to teach him. He was surprised by how little I knew about boats. I should have been more patient with him, but I told him he needed to improve a lot.'

I left my job in London to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in Finland. I was 26 years old and felt restless. I wanted to experience the cold and beautiful Arctic landscapes. I found a company that runs dog-sledding tours and they agreed to take me on as a dog handler. I joined them for three months, from December to February. We took tourists on sled rides through the snow and ice. The dogs were very excited and pulled the sleds quickly.
I arrived at the farm in the dark and was given boots and sent out into the cold. The dogs were barking loudly and I could barely hear myself think. I rubbed the forehead of one of the quieter dogs and someone gestured for me to get on the sled. We set off into the dark with only a head torch for light.
It didn't take long to learn how to guide the sleds, but I had to learn many new skills. I had to feed and water the dogs, which was difficult in the cold weather. A bowl of water would freeze quickly, so we had to make a special soup for the dogs. By the end of my first week, my head was spinning with instructions and my muscles ached from pulling heavy sleds. But I was proud of myself because I learned to chop wood, hammer a nail, and use a circular saw in the snow.

On that day, Paula Radcliffe finished her marathon very quickly. The journalists were surprised and asked her about a special oil she used to heal her injuries. This oil was recommended by Olympic champion Cathy Freeman. Radcliffe had used it to treat her wounds after a bike accident during training.
Radcliffe didn't think her achievement was special at the time. She and her team didn't set any limits for her performance. Her coach and husband, Gary Lough, was worried that she was running too fast and might get tired. But Radcliffe's physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, was confident in her abilities.
As Radcliffe approached the finish line, she calculated that she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes. She had run 41 kilometers very quickly, but still managed to sprint the last 800 meters in 2 minutes 25 seconds. After the race, everyone was amazed by her performance.
Hartmann had worked with many Olympic athletes, but Radcliffe was unique. She was willing to push herself to the limit, and Hartmann had to work very hard to help her recover. Radcliffe's hard work and determination inspired many women to take up long-distance running.

When my cooking show 'In Search of Perfection' first came out, I wasn't sure how people would react. There was a lot of talk about a food revolution in Britain, and I thought our show would make a big contribution. But I was worried: would people like an approach to cooking that involves history, memories, and science? I watched the first show and felt a mix of excitement and fear. But it was a huge success! This success led to other projects, including a book about my restaurant. Each project is like a journey, whether it's into the past, into people's minds, or into cooking techniques. I wrote several books in a series called 'Perfection', each one connected to a TV show. In these books, the journey is often physical, with passports, suitcases, and itineraries. 'In Search of Total Perfection' is the latest in the series. In this one, we travel around the world to meet extraordinary people, like a man who creates the perfect pasta. These people have spent years perfecting their craft. Perfection is personal and subjective. Even choosing which dishes to include in the show was hard, and I knew I would upset some people by leaving out their favorite dishes. But we worked together to come up with a list that everyone could agree on. This shows that each of us has our own idea of perfection, based on our emotions, memories, and surroundings. The book isn't claiming to have the only perfect recipes, but by using my skills and knowledge, talking to food producers and chefs, and experimenting, I could understand what makes these dishes work. The TV show allowed me to explore new foods, people, and places, and I was excited about that. I also explored the connection between food, memory, and nostalgia. Searching for the best ingredients took me on many adventures, including visiting a canning factory that wasn't what I expected and a dairy farm that didn't meet my standards. Refining the recipes was a challenge, and I even tried hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanner, and almost burning my house down trying to make a perfect Neapolitan-style pizza."

My sister Bea was worried because we couldn't stay there forever. The field was big and empty, with only grass and flowers like poppies and daisies.
We got back into the van and waited for John to find someone who could help us. My mum suggested we sit on the side of the road and watch John go to find help. She then lay down on the grass and asked me to tell her a story. I told her about two birds I heard talking the day before we left London. They talked about things like breadcrumbs and the weather. They even had an argument over a worm.

'Spend too much time online? My dad says so. But what do experts think? They say that most teenagers who use social media have many friends, a good sense of who they are, and learn important skills. Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says social media is just a part of modern life. It's not good or bad, it's what you do with it that matters.
Jim Matthews, who studies social media, compares it to hanging out at the youth club when our parents were young. He says it's a way for teenagers to be with friends, share jokes, and talk about things that interest them. Psychologist Keith Davidson says social media can help teenagers find their identity and deal with problems. He thinks it's especially good for shy people who might feel more comfortable talking online.
Professor Andrew Phillips says social media can be helpful for quiet people with special interests. It allows them to connect with others who like the same things. Pauline White, an expert on digital education, says that teenagers who use social media to create their own content, like videos or blogs, are really making the most of it. She thinks it's becoming a powerful tool for creativity and will be important in the workplace.
In the future, teenagers who use social media in a creative way will have an advantage in their careers. They'll be able to work with others, create content, and share it with others. This is an important skill in the 21st century.'

He told us that before this centre, people would just try to ski and hope for the best. But we needed to be careful and control our speed. At first, it was hard for me to go fast and not be scared. I would slow down and land on the flat part of the jump, which was painful. Gareth told me to control the jump, not let it control me. On the second day, we started with trampolines.

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweating and your nails are digging into the safety harness. The ride stops and then slowly moves up. Then, it drops quickly and your stomach is in the air. You're scared, but you know you chose to come to the park and ride the rollercoaster.
Amusement parks are a big business. They need many people to design and build the rides. These people are engineers and designers. They make sure the rides are safe and fun. They also make sure the rides are new and exciting.
It's not easy to design a rollercoaster. It's like solving a puzzle. You need to make sure the ride is safe and fun. You need to make sure it's not too scary or too boring. The designers of rollercoasters have to be very creative and try different things.
I talked to three experts who design rollercoasters. They said that the key is to make the ride feel exciting and safe at the same time. They also said that they need to test the ride before it opens to the public.
Some people might think that rollercoasters will change because of new technology, like virtual reality. But the experts I talked to don't think so. They think that the physical experience of riding a rollercoaster will always be the best part.

Miranda Ellington is a 25-year-old choreographer who has already worked with many theaters and dance companies. She still dances sometimes, even though she's very busy. I'm curious why she does both jobs. She says that dancing again reminds her of what it's like to be a dancer and to take orders from choreographers. As a choreographer, she enjoys teaching young students. They are open to new ideas and willing to take risks. Working with students is easier than with professionals because they don't know their strengths and weaknesses yet. Miranda likes to work with new groups and focuses on the dance steps and music. She wants to be more experimental and have the option to change the music if needed. However, she usually works on big productions with a fixed musical score. Miranda doesn't like to work for just one institution and adapts her style to each new place. She thinks that's important to keep learning and growing.
I saw a documentary about professional ballet dancers and choreographers recently. Miranda said it was accurate and showed the hard work and dedication involved in ballet. She thinks that's not well understood by the public. When she creates a dance production, she wants everything to come together - the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. She's not perfect, but she aims high and is willing to make some mistakes. Miranda doesn't want to be labeled as a modern dance choreographer or ballet specialist. She wants to keep exploring and learning new things.
