Some years ago, a website warned about the dangers of sharing our whereabouts online. The site pointed out that when we post about our location, we're not just telling friends and family, but also strangers who may not be people we'd like to meet. This highlights the potential downsides of sharing our lives online. The internet offers many opportunities to share our thoughts, photos, and stories with a global audience, but it also comes with risks. We may share too much and regret it later.
However, there are people who have already navigated these challenges. The first bloggers, who started sharing their lives online in the early days of the internet, have already learned valuable lessons. One of these pioneers is Justin Hall, a student who began posting about his life on the internet in 1994. He shared his thoughts, photos, and art, and his blog became popular. But when he started writing about his personal life, he faced problems. His blog was shut down, and he lost friends.
Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, had a similar experience. She wrote about her job and her personal life, but her anonymous colleagues discovered her blog and shared it with her bosses. She lost her job as a result. This phenomenon is known as the ""online distribution effect,"" where we feel we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online and offline lives are connected, and we must be careful what we share.
Heather Armstrong eventually learned to manage her online presence and now writes about her family life. Her story shows that we can learn from our mistakes and find a balance between sharing our lives online and protecting ourselves.

Some scientists were worried about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? It's a mix of documentary and drama that shows how little we know about the universe. Most scientists agree that there's still a lot to discover, but some were concerned about the film's claims. The film says that scientists are finding out that the universe is much stranger than we thought. For example, it says that water molecules can be affected by our thoughts. This sounds amazing, but some scientists were sceptical. They said that the evidence wasn't strong enough. The film showed some pictures of ice crystals that looked nice when someone was happy and nasty when someone was in a bad mood. This might seem convincing to some people, but scientists want more proof. 
The film also talks about some real discoveries that scientists have made. For example, they have found out that the universe is made up of a type of matter that we don't understand, and that it's being propelled by a mysterious force called ""dark energy"". Scientists have also found out that our brains take a little time to process what's happening around us, and that we can't always understand everything about the world. 
In fact, scientists are still trying to figure out many things about the universe. They are working on a theory that will explain everything in the universe, but it's a big challenge. Some people think that the universe is amazing and incredible, and that's a good way to sum it up.

Writing novels is a challenge, while writing short stories is a joy. It's like comparing planting a forest to planting a garden. Both processes are important and help me grow as a writer. When I finish a novel, I often feel like writing some short stories. After completing a group of short stories, I might feel like focusing on a novel again. I never work on short stories while writing a novel, and vice versa. This is because the two types of writing require different skills and mental focus. I've been writing novels and short stories for a long time, and I've found that switching between the two helps me stay creative.
I started writing short stories in the 1980s, and it was a new experience for me. At first, it was challenging, but I enjoyed the process and felt it helped me grow as a writer. One of my early short stories, 'Breaking Waves', was included in my first collection of short stories, Tales from Abroad. Writing short stories is faster and less demanding than writing novels. I can usually finish a short story in a week, although revisions can take longer. Writing short stories is like taking a break from the long process of writing a novel. It's a chance to experiment and try new things.
One of the best things about writing short stories is that you can create a story from almost anything - an idea, a word, an image. It's like improvising jazz, and the story can take you in unexpected directions. Another advantage is that you don't have to worry about failing. Even experienced writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write masterpieces. I find this reassuring. You can learn from your mistakes and use them to improve your next story. In fact, I often use my short stories as a way to experiment and learn new techniques that I can apply to my novels.
My short stories are like memories that I've left behind. I remember exactly where I wrote each one and how I felt when I did. They are like guideposts to my heart, and I'm happy to share them with my readers.

Science is a powerful tool that can both help and harm us. It has made our lives easier and more comfortable, but it has also raised many questions about the nature of the universe and our place in it. Scientists have made many important discoveries, but they have also faced many challenges and disagreements. The history of science is marked by conflicts between different ideas and theories, and scientists have often had to overcome strong opposition to their ideas.
Despite these challenges, science has made great progress, and it continues to shape our understanding of the world. In the past, scientists were mainly concerned with understanding the natural world, but today they are also trying to manipulate it to suit their needs. This raises important questions about the responsibility that comes with scientific knowledge and the potential consequences of scientific discoveries.
As we move forward, it is essential that we understand the power of science and its impact on our lives. We must be aware of the benefits and risks of scientific progress and work together to ensure that it is used for the greater good."

From around 2015, the sales of ebooks started to slow down or even decrease in some cases. This raised doubts about the future of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some people think that the hype around ebooks might have led to poor investments, and some companies have lost faith in the power of printed books. Despite this, the idea that ebooks will replace print books still sparks debate. This debate is not just about ebooks and print books, but also about how we react to change and new technologies. 
The idea that one medium will replace another is not new. Before digital technologies, people predicted the end of radio, movies, and television. But these new technologies did not replace the old ones; instead, they found new uses. For example, people started listening to the radio in cars, during train rides, and on factory floors. 
The idea of the disappearing book is also not new. As early as 1894, people predicted that the invention of the phonograph would replace books with audiobooks. But books survived, and people continued to read them. This pattern of predicting the end of one medium and the rise of another has happened many times throughout history.
When new technologies emerge, we form emotional bonds with them, just like we do with objects like books, televisions, and computers. When a new technology replaces an old one, we feel a sense of loss and nostalgia for what we used to know. This is why we often develop industries around retro products and older technologies.
The spread of the printing press, for example, made people appreciate original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies stimulated nostalgia for the older form. The same happened with the shift from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs. When e-readers emerged, people started appreciating the material quality of old books and even their smell.
This should reassure those who worry about the disappearance of print books. However, the idea of the disappearing medium will continue to provide a narrative about the transformative power of technology and our fear of change. We use familiar narrative patterns, such as stories of tragedy and ending, to make sense of change. The story of the death of the book reflects both our excitement for what's new and our fear of losing parts of our world and ourselves."

For 18 months, I woke up every weekday at 5:30 am. I brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and sat down to write about how famous people throughout history managed their daily routines to be creative and productive. By sharing the small details of their daily lives, I hoped to provide a fresh perspective on their personalities and careers. The French chef Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me what time you eat, and whether you take a nap."" This book is about the daily habits of creative people, not just their work. It's about how they organized their time and schedules.
My own struggles with balancing creative work and earning a living inspired this book. I wanted to explore how people with busy lives managed to find time for their passions. Can you devote yourself fully to a project or set aside a small portion of each day? When there's not enough time, do you have to give up something or learn to work more efficiently? I don't claim to have the answers, but I've collected examples of how successful and talented people have dealt with these challenges.
The book's title is Daily Rituals, but I focused on people's routines. Routines are often seen as ordinary and unimportant, but they can be a powerful tool for making the most of our limited time, energy, and motivation. A good routine can help you stay focused and avoid distractions.
This book was inspired by my own procrastination. One Sunday afternoon, I was supposed to write a story, but instead, I spent the day tidying my office and making coffee. I realized that many writers have unusual working habits, and I started researching their schedules. This led me to create a blog and eventually, this book. I've collected a wide range of examples from biographies, articles, and interviews, and tried to let my subjects speak for themselves. I hope this book will inspire readers to find their own daily routines that work for them.

Howard became interested in palaeontology when he was six years old. His family couldn't afford a holiday in Spain, so they went to the English coast instead. On the beach, Howard found an ammonite, a fossilized shell. This sparked his interest in the field. As he grew older, Howard became more focused on the early days of life on Earth. He was particularly fascinated by the tiny creatures that lived on the surface of rocks. After completing his university studies, Howard faced the challenge of finding a job. He applied for a position at Tavistock College in London, but wasn't sure if he would get it. The day of the interview, the professor who was supposed to chair the panel had an argument with his wife and ended up in the hospital. The interview went ahead without him, and Howard was surprised to find out that he got the job. Later, a colleague explained to him that the professor who replaced him had a personal agenda and had chosen Howard for the position. Howard was relieved that he got the job, even if it wasn't exactly how he had hoped.
Years later, Howard's briefcase containing his lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. He reported the theft and postponed his lecture. While waiting for a new briefcase, he met a colleague who was hosting a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that had been acquired, but not yet cataloged or identified. This discovery presented Howard with his greatest challenge and ensured his professional future. If the thief hadn't stolen his briefcase, Howard might not have discovered this opportunity.

Charles Spence, a professor of Experimental Psychology at Oxford University, is known for his unusual eating habits. He has tried foods like bee larvae ice cream, which has a nutty, floral flavor. Spence and his team study how our senses work together to create the taste and smell of food. They have found that many things can affect what we eat and drink, such as the company we're with, the way food is presented, and even the background noise.
Spence has written a book about his research, called The Perfect Meal. He has discovered some surprising things, like the fact that the person who orders first in a restaurant usually enjoys their food the most. He has also found that we eat more food when we're with others - up to 75% more when we're with three people.
Spence's lab is not high-tech, but he is able to work with cooks and chefs to create new and interesting foods. He is funded by a large food company and works with them to create healthier foods. For example, he has helped some companies reduce the amount of salt and sugar in their products. He believes that this is a good way to make people healthier.
Spence has also worked with famous chefs, like Heston Blumenthal, to create new and unusual dishes. He has discovered that the sounds we hear while eating can affect the taste of food. For example, higher-pitched music can make food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched music can make it taste bitter.
Spence's research is being used in many different ways, from restaurants to airlines. He has even created a smartphone app that plays music to match the taste of food. At home, Spence and his family like to have fun with food, too. They have had dinner parties with unusual foods and sounds, like rabbit with fur wrapped around the cutlery and light bulbs that change color.

Our brains are busier than ever. We're constantly bombarded with information, both true and false, and we need to sift through it all to find what's important. At the same time, we're doing more tasks on our own. Thirty years ago, travel agents and salespeople helped us with our daily tasks. Now, we do most things ourselves. We're juggling multiple tasks while trying to keep up with our personal and professional lives, and our smartphones are always by our side.
However, our brains are not designed to multitask efficiently. When we think we're doing multiple tasks at once, we're actually switching between them quickly, which can be costly in terms of mental effort. This means we're not as productive as we think we are. Multitasking can also lead to increased stress and decreased focus.
In fact, research shows that multitasking can reduce our intelligence quotient (IQ) by almost 10 points. It can also make it harder to learn new information and make good decisions. When we're constantly switching between tasks, our brains are working harder than usual, which can lead to mental fatigue.
The constant stream of emails can be overwhelming. We feel pressured to respond to each one, but it's hard to find the time to do so without getting bogged down. As a result, we may end up doing multiple tasks at once, which can be detrimental to our productivity and overall well-being.

In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino had a strange habit. Every night, he would break up concrete into small pieces and throw them at visitors during the day. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other bats that are having trouble giving birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought animals just behaved in certain ways and that was it. But now, scientists are studying animal emotions and moral values. This has led to a debate about whether animals can think and feel like humans do.
Recently, scientists have discovered that animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens have emotions. This has sparked a debate about whether animals have a moral sense, like humans do. In one experiment, cows were given a task to open a gate to get food. Those that could open the gate themselves seemed to enjoy it more than those that had it opened for them. Does this mean that cows like problem-solving? If so, what does it mean for the way we treat them?
Some experts think that this research means we should stop eating meat. Others believe we should rethink how we view animal intelligence. One expert says we should stop assuming animals think like us. The debate is not just about science or morality, but about philosophy. Can we ever really know what it's like to be an animal?
In one study, starlings were kept in different conditions. Some had nice cages, while others had small, bare cages. The birds that had nice cages were more likely to eat even when the food was not good. This suggests that being in a bad environment can make animals pessimistic. Some experts believe that animals can get depressed, just like humans do. Others disagree. The debate is complex and contentious, and it's hard to know what to think.

'Critical thinking is a way to understand and analyze what we read or listen to. Adrian West, a researcher, believes that argument is a way to find the truth. While technology can help us process information and learn, it can also make it harder to think deeply. We are exposed to more information and opinions, which can be overwhelming. This can lead to poor thinking and a lack of critical thinking. According to the National Endowment for the Arts, people are reading less, and this might be affecting their ability to think critically. Some experts think that the focus on visual media, like video games and TV, is making it harder for people to focus on one thing and think deeply. However, technology can also be used in a way that promotes critical thinking. For example, some video games can teach decision-making and analytical skills. It's important to understand how technology affects our thinking and analysis, especially as reading and math scores are declining.'

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic who used to work in an office. He wrote a book about the benefits of manual trades and another one about how to cope with modern life. He was inspired to write this second book when he noticed that advertisements started appearing on credit card machines while he was waiting. He realized that our attention is being constantly demanded and it's becoming harder to focus on what's important.
We're being bombarded with information and representations of the world, such as video games and apps, which often try to manipulate us. This is making it harder to have real conversations with people and to focus on what we want to do. Crawford thinks that we're losing something fundamental in our society by only interacting with representations of people and not with real people themselves.
He believes that we need to find ways to engage with the world in a more satisfying way. He suggests that we need to regulate noise and distractions in public spaces and develop skills that allow us to interact with the world in a more meaningful way. For example, a cook, an ice-hockey player, or a motorbike racer all have to deal with real-world challenges and make judgments about what's important. This helps them develop skills that can't be replicated by manufactured experiences.
Crawford thinks that constantly resisting distractions can be exhausting and makes it harder to focus on what matters. Instead, practicing attention and focus can make it easier to pay attention to others and find what's important.

'What do you do for a living?' is a common question, and we usually answer it with a few words. However, when you're a philosopher, it's a bit harder. Saying you're a philosopher can sound pretentious, as if you're claiming to have some special knowledge that others don't. But philosophers are just ordinary people who think deeply about life.
One reason people think philosophers are special is that they often talk about big ideas and judge what others do. Ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle and Socrates believed that thinking deeply about life was the most important thing. This idea has stuck, and many people still think that philosophers are wise and above the rest.
But philosophy isn't just about being wise; it's about thinking carefully about the world and our place in it. Socrates said that a life without thinking is not worth living, because it means we're just following what others do without questioning it. This means we need to think about our own lives and what we believe in.
Philosophers don't need to be experts in complicated theories or read lots of books. They just need to think about the everyday things that matter to us. This is important because it helps us make our own decisions and live the way we want to.
However, many philosophers today are disconnected from everyday life. They write for other experts and don't share their ideas with others. This makes it hard for people without a background in philosophy to understand what they're talking about. We need to change this and make philosophy more accessible to everyone.
I often call myself an ethicist because I work on ethics, which is the part of philosophy that deals with what's right and wrong. But I think this title is too narrow, as it implies that ethics is just about following rules. In reality, ethics is about thinking deeply about how we live and what we value. It's not just about whether something is right or wrong, but also about why we think it's right or wrong.
Philosophy can help us understand ourselves and the world better. It can help us see that our beliefs might not be as clear-cut as we think, and that's okay. By thinking deeply about our lives, we can make better choices and live more thoughtfully.'

Food lovers and chefs might think that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, philosophers have not usually focused on food in their discussions. When they have talked about eating, it's often been as a metaphor for something else, like learning. Some philosophical conversations seem to be about food, but they're actually exploring other ideas. Interestingly, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus believed in pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain, but he applied this to many areas of life, not just eating. Today, his name is often associated with enjoying food and drink, and is used in the names of restaurants and recipe websites. This suggests that people want to be seen as approving of philosophers' ideas. Food is a social and cultural activity. The food we eat comes from historical contexts and is shared with our communities. These communities provide us with friends and family to share meals with, as well as the systems that grow and distribute food. We interact with food more often and in more ways than with any other commodity, making it a natural topic for philosophical discussion.
Once food is prepared, people start talking and writing about it. But why do food critics get to have such a big influence? One philosopher says that tasting food is not a special skill, but rather that good food critics are just better at describing what they taste. In fact, this is an area that has been neglected, as philosophers have not paid much attention to the way our senses work.
Food is also an aesthetic experience. We talk about beautiful paintings or music, but not the taste of food. Some philosophers argue that, with the rise of modern cooking, food has earned its place in discussions of beauty, alongside sculpture or poetry. However, food is destroyed when we eat it, which is not the case with visual or auditory art. Aesthetic objects should last over time, so it's not fair to consider food a true work of art.
There are many ethical questions surrounding food. For example, we might ask what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, vegetarian, or genetically modified? The answers will often reveal our values. Philosophers will also ask why these answers are what they are, and this debate is justified.
Cooking at home and in restaurants is another issue. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests, driven by their relationships of love and friendship. In the home kitchen, everyone is included, and we come together to share food and companionship. Restaurant cooks, on the other hand, have obligations to their employers and the food itself. This means their kitchens are not open to everyone, and their relationships are with colleagues, not friends.
A recent essay, 'Diplomacy of the Dish', explores how food and dining can bring people together across cultures. This happens in two ways. First, we can learn to appreciate other cultures by enjoying their food. Second, we can form personal bonds with people from other cultures by sharing meals together, a practice with a long history in international diplomacy. The essay is filled with interesting examples and anecdotes, making it accessible to a general audience and bringing to life the idea that food can be a key part of philosophy."

Rob Daviau, an American game designer, wanted to create more exciting board games. He thought that traditional games were no longer challenging or interesting. He wondered if games could have a storyline and if decisions made in one game could affect the next one. He created a new version of the classic game Risk, called Risk Legacy. In this game, players' decisions had a permanent impact. They might have to tear up cards or damage the board. The game is played over several sessions, and players can see how their actions affect the game.
Daviau was asked to work on a legacy version of the popular cooperative game Pandemic. His next project was a game called SeaFall. In this game, players are sailors exploring the world in the 16th to 19th centuries. The game designers have to think about all the possible choices players can make to ensure the story doesn't fall apart. They test the game with players to see how it unfolds.
Daviau didn't expect the legacy format to become popular. He thought it would be a niche idea. But many players loved the concept. They liked the idea of an unfolding adventure and the commitment to playing the game over several sessions. The legacy format has also been compared to video games and TV series. The game designers see it as a way to tell a story and create a sense of ownership.

One night, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the National Aquarium in New Zealand. He crawled across the floor and squeezed into a drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This is a story that sounds like something from a children's movie and was widely shared online. People enjoy stories about animals, especially octopuses, because they are so intelligent and different from humans. Octopuses can open jars, recognize faces, and even play. Some people think it's fun to imagine that animals are like humans, but a scientist named Dr. Frans de Waal argues that it's actually the opposite - we often underestimate the intelligence of animals.
Dr. de Waal has studied primates like gorillas and chimpanzees for many years. He says that animals can do many things that were once thought to be unique to humans, such as thinking about the past and future, feeling empathy, and understanding what others are thinking. Animals are much smarter than we often give them credit for.
In the past, people thought that animals were intelligent and could even be put on trial for crimes. Even Charles Darwin, who developed the theory of evolution, believed that the difference between human and animal intelligence is one of degree, not kind.
However, in the 20th century, the idea of behaviorism became popular, which focused on teaching animals through rewards and punishments. This led people to view animals as either machines that respond to stimuli or as animals with useful instincts. Anyone who thought that animals had internal thoughts and feelings was seen as romantic or unscientific.
But Dr. de Waal believes that we are now starting to recognize that animals are intelligent and have their own way of thinking. He thinks that the best way to test animal intelligence is to design tests that take into account the animal's unique abilities and characteristics. For example, squirrels are great at remembering where they hide their food, while humans need apps to find their phones.
In his book, naturalist Sy Montgomery writes that if an octopus were to test human intelligence, it might ask us to change the color patterns on our skin. Since we can't do that, the octopus might conclude that we are not very intelligent.
Dr. de Waal is skeptical about Inky's escape, but he knows that stories like this can help people appreciate the intelligence of animals. He even ran an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys can feel envy. The monkeys were given either cucumbers or grapes as rewards, and those who got the cucumbers became angry and jealous when they saw their peers getting the better treat. The study was published in a scientific journal, but it was the one-minute video clip that really convinced people of the findings.

'Robotics is a rapidly growing field that is expected to have a profound impact on the way we live and work. While robots have been used in manufacturing and the automotive industry for some time, experts predict that they will soon be used in many other areas, including healthcare, education, and even our homes. This could lead to significant changes in the way we work and live. Many people believe that robots will take over most jobs currently done by humans within the next 50 years, but surprisingly, most people also think that their current jobs will remain unchanged. However, this is unlikely to be the case. Every industry will be affected by robotics in the next few years. For example, a robot in Australia can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, a task that would take two human bricklayers a day or more to complete. Another example is a robot that roams supermarket aisles to ensure that goods are properly stocked and priced.
Experts argue that while robots can't yet service or program themselves, this will create new job opportunities for technicians and programmers. However, others warn that we should not underestimate the importance of human skills in the workplace. World expert Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, research director for IDC, believes that society is not prepared for the impact of robots on our daily lives. According to his report, within two years, almost one-third of robots will be able to work alongside humans safely and efficiently. Within five years, many companies will have a chief robotics officer, and governments will have developed laws to regulate robots. Despite this, there will be a shortage of skilled workers in the robotics industry, leading to a rise in salaries. Dr. Zhang emphasizes the need for people to retrain and adapt to the changing job market. He also predicts that robots will become more common in our daily lives, interacting with us in new and sophisticated ways.
This shift towards robotics poses significant challenges, including the need for new laws and regulations to ensure our safety and privacy. With millions of jobs at risk, it is crucial that we focus on education to prepare for the future of work. Developed countries need more graduates in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to remain competitive in the job market.'"

'Why do people climb mountains? George Mallory, a famous mountaineer, once said, 'Because it's there.' This answer might seem simple, but it's actually a reminder that sometimes we climb just for the adventure and fun. Climbing can be a thrilling experience, but it's not always easy. Climbers face many challenges, like bad weather and difficult terrain. Despite these challenges, many people love climbing because it gives them a sense of freedom and excitement.
Some climbers see climbing as a game, with its own set of rules and strategies. They choose how to climb, depending on the type of climb and the risks involved. Others believe that climbing helps them develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. Climbing can also teach us to be more self-reliant and committed to our goals.
Some climbers prefer to climb alone, without the help of others or technology. They believe that this makes their achievements more meaningful and challenging. Others see climbing as a way to connect with nature and find inner peace. They enjoy the physical and mental challenge of climbing, as well as the sense of accomplishment when they reach the top.
In the end, people climb for many different reasons. Some climb for adventure, others for personal growth, and others for the sense of freedom and excitement. Whatever the reason, climbing can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience.'

""One of the most significant changes in higher education in the UK and worldwide over the past few years has been the encouragement of students to get involved in research from an early stage in their studies. This recognises that research is not just for famous scholars at old universities or scientists who are pushing the boundaries of our knowledge. It's a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills will be useful not only in your studies but also in your future career, as they are a way of thinking and working.
As a student, you contribute to knowledge. You don't just accept what you're told; you create it. Making knowledge is based on asking questions like 'Why?', 'How?', 'What does this mean?', and 'How can I do it differently?' These are the questions that underlie research.
Research can take many forms, from groundbreaking, complex, and intellectual work to everyday enquiries that involve careful planning and thoughtful questioning. Most students have been doing some form of research since they started studying or working. You may have asked questions and investigated answers at school or in the workplace. You may have also developed research skills when planning a holiday, fixing things around the house, or shopping online.
At college and university, you're expected to have an enquiring mind, identify problems and questions, and evaluate the information and ideas you read or hear about. Some students may struggle with this, as they may be used to accepting established knowledge and authority. However, in UK, US, European, and Australian higher education, established knowledge is meant to be questioned.
Critical thinking is crucial in research. It's not enough to simply accept what others have written or said. You need to engage with it, think about it, test it out, and identify whether it's logical and evidence-based. Don't just take facts and information at face value.""

Cities have always been a hub of intellectual activity. From the 18th-century coffeehouses in London, where people gathered to discuss chemistry and politics, to the cafes on the Left Bank in Paris, where artist Pablo Picasso talked about modern art. However, city life is not easy. The same coffeehouses that stimulated discussion also helped spread diseases like cholera. Picasso eventually left the city and moved to the countryside. The modern city is a place of creativity, but it can also be overwhelming and unnatural.
Scientists are now studying how cities affect our brains, and the results are surprising. While it's well-known that city life is exhausting, research suggests that cities can actually dull our thinking. One of the main reasons is the lack of nature. Studies have shown that patients recover faster when they can see trees from their hospital windows. Even brief glimpses of nature can improve our brain performance, as they give us a break from the urban routine.
This research comes at a time when most people live in cities. Instead of living in open spaces, we are now crowded into concrete jungles, surrounded by millions of strangers. In recent years, it's become clear that these unnatural surroundings have important implications for our mental and physical health, and can greatly affect how we think. For example, when we walk down a busy street, we have to constantly pay attention to pedestrians, traffic, and the urban grid. This can be exhausting because it requires a lot of mental effort.
The reason we feel depleted is that our brains have to constantly redirect our attention. Cities are so full of stimuli that we need to constantly focus on what's important and ignore what's not. This takes a lot of energy and effort. In contrast, natural settings don't require the same amount of mental effort.
This idea is called attention restoration theory. Psychologist Stephen Kaplan developed it. He suggested that being in nature can have a restorative effect on our brains. Natural settings are full of things that capture our attention, but they don't trigger negative emotions. This allows our brains to relax and replenish themselves.
Before scientists became concerned about the effects of cities, philosophers and landscape architects were warning about the dangers of city life and looking for ways to integrate nature into urban planning. Parks like Central Park in New York allow people to escape the city and improve their mental health. Research has shown that spending time in nature can improve our cognitive performance.
So, why do cities continue to grow, despite the mental problems they can cause? Research at the Santa Fe Institute found that the same urban features that trigger lapses in attention and memory also correlate with measures of innovation. The concentration of social interactions in cities is what drives creativity. Just as the crowded nature of 18th-century London led to intellectual breakthroughs, the crowded nature of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, contributes to its success as a creative center. The key is to find ways to mitigate the negative effects of city life while maintaining its benefits."

Where should we look for the mind? It seems obvious that thinking happens inside our heads. We can even use special machines to study our brains. However, I think we should consider the possibility that the mind extends beyond our bodies. There is a lot of evidence from archaeology that shows how objects and tools have played a crucial role in human development and the way we think.
It's easy to see why people often associate the mind with the brain. Most of what we know about the brain comes from studying people in isolation, away from their surroundings. This makes sense if you're a neuroscientist, but it can make us forget that our minds are also influenced by the world around us.
I'm not saying that the brain isn't important, but I think we need to consider the idea that our intelligence is not just limited to our brains. Instead, I propose that our minds extend beyond our bodies, into the world around us. This is what my theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), is all about.
MET explores how objects and tools become part of our minds, like when we use a stick to help us navigate the world. It also looks at how this has changed over time and what it means for the way we think.
For example, think about a blind person using a cane. Where does their sense of self begin? The stick becomes an extension of their body, and they use it to create a new way of experiencing the world. This shows us that our minds are capable of adapting and changing as we interact with the world around us.
I believe that our minds are always evolving and that we use technology to help us make sense of the world. This is what I call metaplasticity - our minds are constantly changing and developing as we interact with the material world. I want to emphasize the importance of material culture in shaping our thoughts and minds.
In short, MET offers a new way of understanding how different objects and tools have helped shape our minds and the way we think. It's not just about the brain; it's about the world around us and how we interact with it."

Photography has had a significant impact on the way we perceive the world. In the United States, photography became an integral part of American culture, influencing various aspects of society, from science and industry to art and entertainment. Historians argue that photography is the country's greatest contribution to the visual arts. This claim is significant because photography has become central to American intellectual and artistic discourse.
Photography's appeal can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, its mechanical process aligned with the growing enthusiasm for technology in the United States. Secondly, the camera allowed people to capture and share images of themselves and their families, which was important in a country where individual and national identities were constantly evolving. Thirdly, photography became a means of recording family history and creating a sense of identity.
Photographs are also aesthetically pleasing, as they provide a realistic representation of everyday life. They can be seen as a way of drawing attention to something, saying, ""Look at this!"" The fact that photographs are created by machines makes them unique, as they are records of events, people, and things. However, they also carry a subjective element, as the photographer's perspective is always present.
To fully understand a photograph, it's essential to consider its purpose, function, and cultural context. We need to know why the photographer took the image, how it was initially received, and how its meaning might change over time and in different contexts. The camera's importance in art has become increasingly acknowledged, and many artists have incorporated photographs into their work.

William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the'science of mental life' in 1890. This definition remains relevant today. We all have a mental life, and we have some idea of what this means. However, studying psychology can be challenging because it is difficult to understand the workings of the mind. James believed that human psychology consists of basic elements: thoughts, feelings, and a physical world that exists in time and space. Each of us has personal knowledge based on our own experiences, thoughts, and feelings. This knowledge may or may not be influenced by scientific facts.
When we think about psychological issues, we often rely on our own experiences and opinions. We behave like amateur psychologists when we discuss complex psychological phenomena, such as whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways. However, problems arise when people have different opinions. Formal psychology aims to provide methods for determining which explanations are most likely to be correct.
Psychologists study the brain, but they do not fully understand how it works. They often study behavior and use observations to develop hypotheses about what is happening inside us. The study of psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle. It involves evaluating and interpreting clues, which are derived from careful observation and analysis.
Psychology has the same goals as other sciences: to describe, understand, predict, and modify the processes it studies. By achieving these goals, psychology can help us understand our experiences and apply its findings to people's lives. Psychological research has been useful in various fields, such as education, design, and mental health.
Psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, but they have only been studied scientifically for the past 150 years. Early psychologists used introspection, or self-reflection, to study the mind. However, this method has limitations. Contemporary psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of the phenomena they are interested in, rather than on self-reflection.

In a warehouse in Michigan, USA, there is a unique collection of failed products. It's called the Museum of Failed Products. The museum's owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has its own story of failure, which is often a result of mistakes made by designers, marketers, and salespeople. What's surprising is that this museum exists as a successful business. Many companies would have their own collection of failed products, but surprisingly, they don't. The museum's owner, Robert McMath, started collecting products in the 1960s with the intention of creating a reference library. However, he ended up with a collection of mostly unsuccessful products. This is because most products fail.
The culture of optimism might be responsible for the existence of these failed products. Each product must have been approved by several people before being released, and even if they knew it was doomed, there was a pressure to invest more money to make it work. Nobody wants to talk about their failures, so the products are left to gather dust. This is particularly true in the self-help industry, where people are encouraged to focus on positive thinking. However, research suggests that this approach might not be effective. Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that spending time thinking about how well things could go actually reduces people's motivation to achieve their goals. On the other hand, psychologist Carol Dweck believes that our experiences of failure are influenced by our beliefs about ability. People who believe that ability is fixed are more likely to be discouraged by failure, while those who believe that ability can be developed through hard work and challenge see failure as an opportunity to learn and grow.

Playing at home is often considered an advantage for sports teams. But why is this the case? Many people assume it's obvious, but professional sports are changing, and what we used to think was true may not be true anymore. Two main factors have challenged our understanding of home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to know what makes players perform well, and they have come up with many theories about home advantage. Meanwhile, those who make money from sports want to know why home advantage matters. If players are well-paid, shouldn't they feel comfortable anywhere?
This raises a question: would it matter if a team like Manchester United played some of its home games in a different country to attract more fans? It would matter to the fans who believe their team needs their passion and loyalty to win.
Many fans think that when their team scores a goal, it's because of their cheering. But this isn't always true. In fact, there are many times when the team doesn't score, even when the fans are cheering. However, there is one thing that fans do that seems to have a real effect: they shout at the referee. Researchers found that referees who heard the sound of cheering fans were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This is because the referees try to avoid making decisions that might make the crowd angry.
Studies have shown that home advantage has decreased over time in most sports. In the past, home teams used to win around 70% of the time, but now it's around 60%. This might be because travel is easier now, and players are treated better on the road. However, none of these explanations fully explain why home advantage varies from sport to sport. For example, basketball is the sport where playing at home is most advantageous, while baseball is the sport where home advantage counts the least.
One possible reason for this difference is that team sports, like basketball, rely on teamwork, which builds confidence and familiarity with teammates. In sports like baseball, individual players are more important, and there may be less teamwork. Another possibility is that playing at home boosts players' testosterone levels, making them more aggressive and motivated to defend their home turf.
In the end, the mystery of home advantage remains, and it's up to researchers to continue studying it."

'The more I practice, the better I get,' said the golfer Gary Player many years ago. This phrase is famous in the world of sports and is valued by top athletes and coaches. It's easy to understand why. The phrase is often disputed, with some people arguing that other golfers said it first. The meaning is also unclear - Player was being ironic and meant that the more he practiced, the better he became. However, the phrase has sparked a debate about whether talent is natural or acquired. This debate is not balanced, with most experts agreeing that practice is more important than innate talent. The idea that practice is key to success in any field, including sports, music, and business, comes from the work of psychologist Anders Ericsson. He suggests that with 10,000 hours of practice, anyone can become an expert. Many books have been written about this idea, but a new book argues that it's not that simple. The author, Epstein, believes that there are many factors that contribute to someone's success, including their genes, environment, support, and determination. He looks at many examples, including the world's toughest sled dog race in Alaska, where the dogs' drive and desire are crucial. This challenges the idea that commitment and determination are choices that can be made. Epstein also examines the importance of both nature (genetics) and nurture (environment) in elite athletes. He agrees that both are necessary, but also looks at cases where genetics play a significant role. The book also touches on the issues of race and gender in sports, asking why men and women are separated in competitions. Sometimes the simplest questions are the most important ones.'

A recent report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel unhappy and lonely. Jay Griffiths asks: why are today's children so unhappy? In her book, Kith, Griffiths argues that children have become too dependent on screens and have lost touch with nature. They spend too much time indoors, watching TV or using computers, and have forgotten how to connect with the natural world. This is the main problem, she believes.
A study found that many children want to spend more time outdoors. They don't want more gadgets, they just want to be free to play outside. Many adults remember their own childhoods fondly, when they spent hours playing in the woods, swimming in rivers, or building dens in old sheds. They say that was a healthier and happier time than today.
Griffiths argues that the fear of danger has led parents to keep their children indoors, and this plays into the hands of the toy and gadget industry. She also criticises the trend of prescribing medication for restless children or requiring them to wear goggles during playground games. She believes that children should be allowed to take risks and learn to manage them.
However, Griffiths' ideas are not without criticism. Some argue that she romanticises childhood and ignores the complexities of parenting. She believes that children should be given more freedom and autonomy, but doesn't provide a clear plan for achieving this. Additionally, not all children may want to follow the ""wild"" model she advocates for. What about the children who are naturally timid or cautious?
Overall, Griffiths' book raises important questions about the way we treat children and the kind of childhood we want to provide for them."

As a research psychologist, I've learned that the skills we need to solve problems in life can't be taught in school. They come from our experiences and the way we think. Children learn by playing, and this is true for all mammals, including humans. The more complex the problem, the more we need to learn, and the more we need to play.
Play is a natural way for humans and animals to learn. It's how we develop important skills like creativity, cooperation, and self-control. These skills are essential for a happy and productive life. Unfortunately, schools are not providing children with the opportunities to learn these skills. Instead, they are focusing on teaching children what to do, rather than letting them discover things for themselves.
Creativity is key to success in today's world. We need people who can think creatively and come up with new ideas. This is something that can't be taught, but it can be encouraged by allowing children to play and explore. Adults who are creative and innovative are those who have retained their childlike curiosity and sense of play.
Unfortunately, children are not being given the opportunity to play as much as they used to. Schools are becoming more structured, and parents are more involved in their children's lives. This is leading to a decline in the amount of time children have to play and explore. We need to give children the freedom to play and make their own decisions. This is the key to helping them develop into happy, confident, and successful adults.

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to look for a job. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to contact potential employers directly. However, this increased access also means there's a higher chance of making mistakes. A recent incident in the US shows how important it is to use social media correctly. A young jobseeker contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn, hoping to get help finding a job. The executive was upset and sent a harsh rejection message that went viral. The incident highlights the importance of being careful when using social media for professional purposes.
For many young people, social media is a part of their daily life, and they may not realize that using it for professional purposes is different. They may be used to sharing personal information and opinions online, but this is not suitable for a professional setting. When using social media for job hunting, it's essential to be clear about who you are and what you can offer. Avoid sending impersonal messages and be humble in your approach.
In the past, social media was used for personal purposes, like escaping the rules and expectations of parents and teachers. It was a place to create a fantasy identity and connect with others. However, this experience may not prepare young people for the professional world, where they need to be professional and respectful.
Employers often complain that young job seekers on professional networking sites come across as arrogant or over-familiar. This can damage their chances of getting a job, even if they have the skills and drive to be successful. To make a good impression, it's essential to be clear, respectful, and professional in your online communication.
The key to using social media for job hunting is to be careful and considerate. Explain who you are and what you can offer, and be prepared to help the person you're contacting in some way. By doing so, you'll increase your chances of getting a positive response."

Newspapers are facing a crisis. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national dailies has decreased by a third to half. In the US, the Pew Research Centre reports that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26% of citizens, down from 45% in 2001. Many experts predict that the last printed newspaper will be gone within 15 years. However, history shows that old media often survive. For example, theatre, despite predictions of its demise, has continued to thrive.
Newspapers were once a new medium, but it took centuries for them to become the dominant way to get news. This was due to advances in technology, such as the steam press, railway, and telegraph, which made it possible to produce and distribute news quickly and cheaply. Additionally, people began to understand that the world is constantly changing and that they need to stay informed about what's happening.
In the past, people did not need news on a regular basis. In fact, the concept of needing daily or weekly news is a relatively recent development. Before the 19th century, people's lives were more predictable, with the changing of the seasons being the main event. News was not a priority, and journalism as a profession did not exist.
Now, with the internet, people can access news whenever and wherever they want. Online news providers can update stories in real-time, correct mistakes, and provide more in-depth information. However, despite these advantages, many news providers are focused on being the first to break a story, rather than providing in-depth analysis and understanding. This is a departure from the traditional role of newspapers, which was to inform and educate readers.
In some ways, the way we consume news today is similar to how it was in the past. In medieval times, news was shared in marketplaces and taverns, where rumors and misinformation were common. Today, with the internet, we are bombarded with information, and it's easy to get confused. Newspapers, which were never great at explaining how the world works, may face extinction. Alternatively, they may find a new way to guide us towards understanding and wisdom in this chaotic world.

If we were meant to live under the light of the moon and stars, we would be comfortable in the dark. However, we are diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to living in sunlight. This is deeply ingrained in our biology, even though we don't often think about it. We've managed to engineer the night to suit ourselves by filling it with artificial light. This has consequences, known as light pollution, which scientists are only now studying.
Light pollution is mainly caused by poorly designed lighting that shines upwards into the sky, rather than downwards where it's needed. This washes out the natural darkness, affecting many forms of life, including humans. Where artificial light enters the natural world, it can disrupt natural rhythms and behaviors, such as migration, reproduction, and feeding.
In the past, the concept of light pollution wouldn't have made sense. Imagine walking through a moonlit London in the 1800s, when it was a much smaller city. The only light came from candles, torches, and lanterns. You would have been more likely to smell the city than see it from afar.
We've lit up the night as if it were an empty space, but it's not. Many species, including mammals, are nocturnal and rely on the night. Light can be a powerful attractant, and scientists have seen birds being drawn to artificial light sources, even to the point of colliding with buildings.
It's not just astronomers who are affected by light pollution; we all need darkness to maintain our biological rhythms. Denying ourselves darkness can lead to physical problems. Our bodies rely on the natural cycle of day and night to function properly.
In the end, we're just as trapped by light pollution as the frogs near a brightly lit highway. By living in a world of artificial light, we've cut ourselves off from our natural heritage and our place in the universe. Light pollution makes us forget the scale of our existence, which is best appreciated in the depths of a dark night with the Milky Way above.

A multinational company has announced that it will no longer track its employees' paid holiday time. The idea came from an internet company that has a similar policy. The founder of the multinational company says that employees can take as much leave as they want, as long as they are sure it won't harm the business. However, this approach may not be practical for a large company with many different departments and employees.
In a small company, it's easier for employees to know each other's workloads and schedules, so they can take leave without worrying about the impact on the business. But in a large company, it's harder to keep track of everything, and employees may feel guilty or stressed about taking leave.
Additionally, the policy may lead to a culture of not taking leave at all, or feeling pressured to work long hours to keep up with colleagues. This could result in decreased productivity and morale. The company's policy also blurs the line between work and leisure time, making it difficult for employees to disconnect from work.
The article questions whether unlimited leave is a good idea, especially for a large company. It suggests that employees need a minimum amount of statutory paid annual leave to rest and recharge, and that this is important for their mental and physical health. The article concludes that the policy may not achieve its intended goals and may even have negative consequences.

Journal-based peer review is the process of checking a scientific research paper by experts in the same field. It's meant to ensure that the paper is accurate and trustworthy. However, some people question whether it's worth the delay in publication. I'm not ready to give up journal-based peer review, but I think it's changing. The use of preprints, or early drafts of papers, is becoming more common. Preprints are posted online without being reviewed and are stored in digital archives. This allows academics to share their research quickly and get feedback from others. In the past, publication in journals was about sharing new findings, but now it's often about getting recognition and advancing one's career. This has changed the way authors and reviewers work. Authors may leave out important data to get published in top journals, and reviewers focus on whether a paper is good enough for the journal rather than its quality. These problems are well-known, but many scientists are reluctant to change the system. However, some experts think that preprints could be a solution because they don't require a major change. Preprints have been around for 20 years, but they haven't been widely used. This is partly due to the misconception that journals won't accept papers that have been posted online as preprints. Some people also worry that publishing papers without review will lead to 'junk science', but this hasn't happened so far. In reality, preprints are open to critique and discussion by the scientific community. One professor recalls that posting a preprint allowed her to get feedback from the original authors and readers could evaluate the quality of the arguments. Preprints could also be used to share negative results, which are often overlooked in the pursuit of new discoveries. By using preprints, we can refocus on the work itself, not where it's published.

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it's like a picture made with words. But I'm not satisfied with that answer. One day, I asked them to write two paragraphs about an object. The first paragraph should describe the object in a scientific way, like a scientist would. The second paragraph should be written from the object's point of view, and it should be called 'Poem'. One student chose an oxygen mask and wrote: 'I'm a device that helps people breathe. I'm only used in emergencies and for a short time. Most people will never need me.' This exercise helped us understand how poetry is unique and special.
When I was in school, I didn't understand poetry. I thought it was just a puzzle that got in the way of understanding and feeling. Now, I know that poetry can be many things: a way to express deep feelings, a source of stunning images, or a place for reflection and wit. But what do we hope to find in a poem? Do we look for tears, information, or a good story? Poetry is not like films, articles, or novels. It has its own special qualities. One of these is ambiguity, which is a part of our daily lives.
We often ask ourselves what a poem is. Some people compare poems to wild animals or machines, but these comparisons don't really work. The most important thing is to think about what a poem is and how it makes us see things in a new way. Poetry can be like a song, with words and music that get stuck in our heads. And even though a poem is just words on a page, it can have a powerful impact. It can surprise us and make us think."
