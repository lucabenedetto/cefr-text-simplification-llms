Here is the simplified text for a learner of level A1:

Some time ago, a website talked about the risks of sharing our whereabouts online. The website said that when we share where we are, we are also telling many people, not all of whom we know. This made people think about the bad things that can happen when we share too much online.

A long time ago, some people started using the internet to share their lives with others. They wrote about their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. They even shared photos and stories. But they soon realized that sharing too much online can be dangerous. They got in trouble, lost friends, and even got fired from their jobs.

One of these early internet users was a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall. He started sharing his life online in 1994. He wrote about his thoughts, feelings, and experiences. He even shared photos and art. People loved reading about him and his life. But one day, he fell in love and wrote about it online. His girlfriend didn't like it and told him to stop writing about their relationship or she would leave him. Justin chose to stop writing about his life online.

Another person who shared her life online was Heather Armstrong. She wrote about her job and her life. But one day, her boss found out and she lost her job. This is called the ""online distribution effect"". It means that we might say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But our online life is connected to our real life. We should think carefully before sharing too much online.

Heather Armstrong learned a lesson. She stopped writing about her life online for a while, but then started again. This time, she wrote about her new family and her life as a mom. She became very popular and even made money from her writing. She learned that we can share our lives online, but we should be careful and think about the consequences.

Here is a simplified version of the text for a learner of level A1:

Some scientists were worried about a new film called What the Bleep Do We Know?. The film is a mix of documentary and drama and shows that we don't know a lot about the universe. This is true, and even scientists don't know everything. But some scientists didn't like the film and said it was wrong. They said it was like a magic show, and they didn't like the way it showed some scientific discoveries. One discovery is that water can be affected by our thoughts. This is amazing, but some scientists think it's not true because there's no proof. The film showed some pictures of ice crystals, but that's not enough proof. Scientists want to see more evidence before they believe something. 

Later in the article, it talks about some real scientific discoveries that are amazing. For example, scientists have found out that the universe is made of a special kind of matter and energy that we don't understand. They have also found out that our brains can't always understand what's happening around us because it takes a little time. And some scientists think that the universe was designed in a special way so that life could exist. These discoveries show that we don't know everything, and we might never know everything. Scientists are still trying to figure out the secrets of the universe.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text at level A1:

I like writing short stories. It's easy and fun. Writing novels is harder. It's like planting a big forest, while writing short stories is like planting a small garden. I like doing both. They help me become a better writer.

I write novels and short stories at different times. When I finish a novel, I want to write some short stories. When I finish a group of short stories, I want to write a novel. I don't write short stories while I'm writing a novel, and I don't write a novel while I'm writing short stories.

I started writing short stories in 1984. It was hard at first, but it was fun. I felt like I could do anything. My readers liked my short stories too.

I like writing short stories because they don't take long to finish. It's like a short trip. I can write a short story in a week. Novels take a long time. It's like a long trip. Sometimes I feel like giving up.

Short stories are fun because I can write about anything. It's like playing jazz music. If my idea doesn't work, I don't worry. I just try again. I can learn from my mistakes and use them in my next story.

My short stories are like little footprints in the sand. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are like a map to my heart. I'm happy to share these feelings with my readers.

'Science is very important. It helps us understand the world and make new things. Sometimes it helps us cure diseases and make our lives better. But sometimes it can also cause problems. Scientists are always trying to learn more, but they don't always agree on what they think they know. They make mistakes, but they also make new discoveries that change our understanding of the world. In the past, people thought they knew a lot about the world, but then new discoveries changed everything. Now, scientists are trying to figure out the whole universe, from the smallest things to the biggest things. This is not just about learning, it's also about being careful with the world and making sure we don't make mistakes that can harm people or the planet. We all need to pay attention to science and what it can do for us.'

'Ebooks were very popular for a while. But now, some big publishers are saying that ebook sales are not growing. In fact, some are even going down. This is making people wonder if ebooks will replace print books. One person in the publishing industry said that ebooks might have been a bad idea because people are not using them as much as they thought. But many people still think that ebooks and print books can coexist.

The idea that ebooks will replace print books is not new. People have been worried about this since the 1800s. They thought that new technologies like the phonograph would make books unnecessary. But radio, television, and other new technologies did not replace books. Instead, people found new ways to use them.

When new technologies come out, people often worry about losing the things they are used to. This is because we get attached to the things we use every day. We might even give names to our cars or computers. When something new comes along, we might feel sad that we can't use the old thing anymore. This is why some people still like old things, like vinyl records or cassette tapes.

The idea that ebooks will replace print books is just a story that people tell to make sense of change. It's a way to talk about how technology is changing our lives. But in reality, ebooks and print books can both be useful and fun. We don't have to choose between them.'

Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in his family's plans when he was six years old. His father had to cancel a trip to Spain due to rising interest rates. Instead, they went to the beach in England and Howard found an ammonite. He knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist from a young age. He studied the beginning of life on Earth, not the dinosaurs. He finished his studies and was worried about getting a job. He applied for a job at Tavistock College in London, but wasn't sure if he would get it. The person who was supposed to interview him was late and another professor took his place. This professor didn't like Howard's boss, so he made sure Howard got the job. Howard was surprised, but happy to have the job.

Later, Howard found out that a colleague had told him about the job, not the professor who interviewed him. Howard was happy to have the job and could do the work he loved. He often thought about how his professional life was organized and planned, but his personal life was not. One day, someone stole his briefcase with important notes for a lecture. He reported the theft and postponed the lecture. He met a colleague who told him about a new collection of fossils at the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard was excited and decided to go to the museum to study the fossils. He cancelled his other plans and saved up money to go to Nairobi.

We used to ask travel agents to book our flights and salespeople to help us find what we need in shops. Now we do most things ourselves. We're doing many things at once, like checking our phones, watching TV, and talking to friends. But our brains are not good at doing many things at once. We think we're doing many things, but really we're just switching between them quickly. This can make us feel stressed and confused.

Our brains are not good at handling too much information. It's like trying to juggle many balls at once. We might think we're doing a good job, but really we're not getting much done. We're also making a lot of small decisions, like answering emails, and this can be tiring for our brains. It's hard to make good decisions when we're tired.

'A long time ago, people thought animals just did things without thinking. They didn't think animals had feelings or a sense of right and wrong. But now, scientists are studying animal behavior and they're finding out that animals can think and feel. For example, a chimpanzee at a zoo broke up concrete to throw at visitors. Was he being mean? And in the US, female bats help other bats have babies. Are they being kind?

Scientists are learning more about animal feelings and it's making us think about how we treat animals. We're eating animals, like cows, and we're wondering if it's right. Some scientists say we should stop eating meat because animals can think and feel. Others say we should just be kind to animals and not eat them.

It's a big debate. Some people think animals can think and feel like us, while others think they're different. We can't know for sure what it's like to be an animal, but we can try to be kind to them.'

'Critical thinking is when we use our brains to understand what we read or hear. We try to think deeply about it. Adrian West, a researcher, says that technology can help us learn and remember things, but it can also make it harder to think deeply. We are exposed to a lot of information, but it can be hard to make sense of it all.

Many people think that reading is important for critical thinking. When we read, we use our imagination and think deeply about what we are reading. But now, many people are reading less and watching more TV and playing video games. This can make it harder to think deeply.

Some people think that video games can actually help us think better. They can teach us important skills like decision-making and problem-solving. These games can also help us explore new ideas and concepts.

Matthew Crawford is a writer and a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office, but he didn't like it. He likes his job now because he can work with his hands. His first book was about why manual work is good. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life.

Matthew noticed that when he was shopping, advertisements started popping up on the credit card machine while he was entering his PIN number. He realized that these ads are everywhere and are hard to avoid. They take our attention away from what we really want to think about. We can't even remember conversations we've had because we're always being interrupted.

Everyone is trying to avoid being interrupted, so we close ourselves off and don't talk to strangers. We see the world through screens and apps, and they make us want more and more. Matthew is worried about this.

He thinks that we should focus on the things that are real, like talking to people and doing things with our hands. He gives examples of people who have to focus on the world around them, like cooks, hockey players, and motorbike racers. They can't just use a screen to get what they need.

Matthew thinks we should find ways to use our judgment and pay attention to what's real. This can help us focus on what's important and make it easier to talk to others.<|eot_id|>"

'What do you do for a living?' This is a common question we ask when we meet someone new. But when you're a philosopher, it's a bit tricky to answer. Some people think that saying you're a philosopher means you're smart and know a lot of big words. But that's not true. Philosophers are just people who think about important questions and try to find answers.

A long time ago, some famous philosophers like Aristotle and Socrates said that thinking about big questions is important. They thought that people should think about what's right and wrong, and how to live a good life. But it's not just about reading big books or being a expert. It's about thinking about the things that happen in our daily lives.

Some people think that philosophers are too smart and don't care about what regular people think. But that's not true. Philosophers want to help people think about their lives and make good choices. They want to help people understand what's important and what's not.

I'm a philosopher, and I like to think about big questions like 'Is it okay to download movies for free?' or 'How do we decide what's right and wrong?' I think that by thinking about these questions, we can learn more about ourselves and the world around us. And that's what being a philosopher is all about.

Here is a rewritten version of the text at a level suitable for A1 learners:

Food is a big part of our lives. We eat every day and enjoy it with our friends and family. Some people love food so much that they think about it a lot. They might wonder why we eat what we eat and how we should eat it. 

In the past, people who thought about big questions didn't talk much about food. They talked about other important things like how to learn and grow. When they did talk about food, it was usually just a way to explain something else. 

One old Greek philosopher named Epicurus liked to enjoy good food and drink. His name is now used to name restaurants and food shops. This is because people think that if something is good enough for a famous philosopher, it must be good! 

Food is special because it's something we share with others. We grow and cook food with the help of our communities. We also share food with our friends and family. This makes food an important topic to think about. 

Some people write about food and tell us what they think about it. But why do they get to decide what's good or bad? It's not because they're experts, but because they're good at describing what food tastes like. 

Food can also be beautiful, like a painting or a song. Some people think that food should be included in discussions about beauty. But food is eaten and gone, so it can't be beautiful in the same way that a painting or a song can. 

There are also important questions about what we should eat. Should we eat food that's good for the planet or food that's good for us? These are important questions that can help us understand what we believe. 

Finally, food can bring people together. When we cook for our friends and family, we show them we care. When we cook for strangers, we have to think about what's best for everyone. Food can even help us understand people from other cultures. When we eat with them, we learn about their customs and traditions. 

This text is interesting because it talks about food in a way that makes us think about why we eat what we eat and how we can make the most of our food.<|eot_id|>"

Rob Daviau from the US makes special board games. He thought old board games were not fun or challenging anymore. He wondered if board games could have a story. He took an old game called Risk and made a new version called Risk Legacy. In this game, the decisions players make affect the game in a big way. Players might have to tear up cards or damage the board. The game is played over many sessions, and players can remember what happened before. Daviau worked on another game called Pandemic. This game is about saving the world from diseases. He also made a game called SeaFall. In this game, players are sailors and explore the ocean.

Designers of legacy games have to think about all the choices players can make to make the story work. They test the games to see how they will play out. Jaime Barriga was a tester for SeaFall. He said it takes a lot of time to play the game and sometimes it gets broken. Legacy games were not expected to be popular, but many people love them. They like the idea of playing a new game every time.

Rob Daviau thought it would be a special game, but not many people would play it. But many people, like Russell Chapman, love legacy games. He says it's exciting to learn something new every time he plays. Ben Hogg likes the idea of an adventure that unfolds. He says it's like watching a TV series. The idea of legacy games comes from video games and TV shows. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, says designing a legacy game is like writing a book. You need to have an idea of where it starts and ends, but also be flexible. Rob Daviau is happy to see others make their own legacy games.<|eot_id|>"

'One night, a clever octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the New Zealand Aquarium. He climbed out of the tank, crossed the floor, and slid into a small pipe that led to the ocean. This is a fun story that many people loved reading online. We like to imagine that animals are like us, doing clever things. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very smart, but they have bodies that are very different from ours. They can open jars, recognize faces, and even play games. Some scientists think that we should not be surprised by how smart animals are. They say that we often forget that animals can do things that we thought were only human. 

In the past, people thought that animals were not very smart. But now we know that animals can think about the past and the future, feel sorry for each other, and even understand what others are thinking. 

Some people used to think that animals were very smart, even in the past. A long time ago, people thought that animals could be put on trial for doing bad things. And a famous scientist named Charles Darwin said that the difference between humans and animals is not as big as we thought.

But in the 20th century, people started to think that animals were not very smart. They thought that animals just reacted to things, like machines. This was a sad time for animals, because people were hurting the environment and treating animals badly.

Now, scientists are learning more about animal intelligence. They are designing special tests to see how smart animals are, and they are finding out that animals are much smarter than we thought. For example, squirrels can remember where they hid their food, and octopuses can change the color of their skin.

Some people think that if an octopus could test human intelligence, it would be very easy for humans to fail. We are not as good at changing colors as octopuses are!'

Many experts think that robots will soon be used in many industries, not just in factories. This will change many jobs. Some people think that robots will take over most jobs, but many people also think that their jobs will stay the same.

There are already robots that can do things that humans can't. For example, a robot in Australia can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour, which would take two humans a long time to do. Another robot in the US helps keep supermarkets clean and makes sure products are in stock.

Some people think that robots will create new jobs for technicians and programmers. Others worry that robots will take away the human touch and make it hard for people to work together.

A expert on robots, Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, says that we need to be prepared for the changes that robots will bring. He thinks that people should learn new skills to adapt to the changes.

In the future, we will see new kinds of robots that can help us in our daily lives. These robots will be very smart and will be able to work with us. This will create new opportunities for companies, but it will also bring new challenges, like making sure we are safe and private.

'Why do people climb mountains? One famous climber, George Mallory, said ""Because it's there."" This answer is simple, but it's true. Climbing mountains is a big adventure. Some people love the feeling of freedom when they climb. They like to challenge themselves and try new things. But climbing can also be very hard and scary. Sometimes, climbers get stuck in bad weather or have to wait in a tent for a long time.

Some people think climbing is a way to learn important skills like being brave, humble, and respectful of nature. Climbing can help us become better people. Others believe that climbing is in our nature - we are born to take risks and try new things. 

Climbing can also be a way to relax and feel calm. The physical work of climbing can be meditative, like a kind of exercise for the mind. Some people even think that climbing is like a way to train the mind to be peaceful, like in Zen philosophy.

The tools are available. You won't get a job if you don't make something.""

John Field agrees, ""It's not easy. There are many people who want to work in games, but few are good enough. You need to be creative, technical, and have a good idea. You can do it on your own, but it's hard. A good course can help. Most game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They like all kinds of entertainment and art. They are interested in the future of games and know that it's changing. Connections are important too. You need to know people to get ahead in this industry.'

I'm glad I didn't stop playing like my friend did. When I score a goal, people say it's luck, but I work hard to practice my shots. The best players in the world practice a lot too. I want to teach kids to enjoy learning new skills. I played many sports at school, but football was my favorite. I want my son to have a good education, but I also want him to enjoy playing football. When I was a professional football player, my manager helped us younger players to play with the first team. We knew we had to work hard. We lost our first game, but we didn't give up. I help my family and friends, but I don't want them to rely on me. I want to use my money to make things easier for them.

We lived at Reef Point because of Sam Carter. He was my father's friend in Los Angeles. My father and Sam were friends, and Sam helped us find a cheap place to live. My father was having trouble writing because he didn't like Los Angeles. Sam was worried that he would lose his friends and money.

Reef Point was a quiet beach because it was hard to get to. But in the summer, more people came to visit. My father was working hard to write a script. I would go to the beach every day with my dog Rusty. Rusty was a friendly dog who liked to dig and swim. He would bring me things he found on the beach.

One day, my father went to Los Angeles to give his script to the people who wanted it. Rusty and I stayed at the beach all day. We watched the surfers. They were having fun riding the waves. One surfer was very good. She asked me why I didn't join them. I told her I didn't have a surfboard. She said I could buy one, but I didn't have money. She asked if I was British and if my father was American. I said no, my father was here to write a book. She knew the book and asked me what my father's name was. I told her Rufus Marsh.

Violet was waiting in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She was going on a cruise, but things weren't going well. There was a problem with the computer system, so the line wasn't moving. Violet was getting worried. She had paid a lot of money for this trip and she wanted to make the most of it. She was also worried because she had lost her phone. She couldn't call the taxi company to ask if she had left it in the taxi. She was starting to feel like she had made a big mistake.

An approachable-looking couple stood behind her in the line. Violet asked if she could borrow their phone to make a quick call. She called her son Harry and asked him to ask their neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was at their flat. Violet was relieved that she had thought to do this.

Finally, the line started moving and Violet went to the desk to check in. She felt a bit disappointed when she saw the ship's foyer. It was not as luxurious as she had expected. The carpets and decorations were nice, but it felt like a big hotel.

Violet took the elevator to her room on the 12th floor. She was relieved to find that it had a balcony, just like she had asked for. She had been worried that it wouldn't, so she was happy. Violet had paid a lot of money for this trip and she wanted to enjoy it.

'Jonny Kinkead loves making guitars. He has been making guitars for 40 years. When he was a boy, he used to play with his dad's tools and a guitar. He still loves making guitars because it's amazing that you can make a beautiful sound by putting together two pieces of wood. Jonny learned to play the guitar when he was 11. Then he wanted to learn the bass guitar. He didn't buy one; he made one himself. He studied how different types of wood sound different and how to put them together. Jonny's dad taught him how to use tools and fix things. He even fixed instruments for his friends.

After school, Jonny went to university to study architecture. But he didn't like it. He liked making things, not just designing them. He realized that making guitars is like sculpture, but you make things that people can use. So, he started making guitars for a living. It wasn't easy at first. He had to work hard to get known and figure out how to price his guitars. But now, people know him as a good guitar-maker. He thinks it's easier for new guitar-makers today because people respect UK-made guitars now.

Jonny says that you can learn a lot in school, but you also need to try things and make mistakes. He learned by trying different things and seeing what worked and what didn't. He thinks that's the best way to learn.'

'Talking about the weather is a big part of English conversations. Many people think that English people love talking about the weather because it's interesting. But that's not true. The weather is just a way to start a conversation. When two English people meet, they often talk about the weather. This is because it's a way to be friendly and polite. It's like saying ""hello"" or ""how are you?"" in other countries. 

Some people think the weather is boring, but that's not the point. The point is that talking about the weather helps people feel comfortable and relaxed around each other. It's like a secret code that only English people understand. 

There are three times when English people usually talk about the weather: when they first meet, when they're trying to find something to talk about, and when they need to fill a silence. So, it might seem like English people love talking about the weather, but really, it's just a way to be friendly and polite.'

Alice couldn't find a book that told her what she wanted to know, so she decided to write one herself. She had been teaching for 31 years, but then she retired and started writing books.

Alice used to teach English and History. She loved teaching and making her students interested in learning. She loves children and wants to keep in touch with them through her writing. She wrote her first book because she wanted to fill a gap in the market. She was inspired by a course she did at a writing school. She wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby.

The silence is broken by the loud noise when a point is over. I hear it, but it seems far away. I don't think about the thousands of people watching me or the millions watching on TV. I am very focused. I have always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My coach, my uncle, told me it was the biggest tournament. I wanted to play there and win. Before 2008, I played and lost twice against Roger Federer. I was very sad after the second loss. I knew I could have done better. My coach told me to stop crying and that there would be other Wimbledons. I was worried that this might be my last chance. But my coach was right. Another chance came. I was more confident this time.

But what about dreams? I haven't heard much about dreams lately. When we wake up early, we often cut off the last hour or two of sleep, and that's when we have our most vivid dreams. Our brains use this time to process what we've learned and to make new connections. 

Some people think that dreams are important for artists, like writers and filmmakers. They use their dreams to get new ideas and to solve problems. But I think that everyone can use their dreams to be more creative. We all need to think creatively in our daily lives, whether we're teachers, software designers, or politicians.

""When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, you can be sure it's not classical music they're listening to. Most people know many pop groups, but ask friends if they know who Brahms is, and they might not know. I'm studying music, but my friends don't know much about classical music. If you don't know who wrote the music, you won't buy their records. Few people like classical music. Only 3% of concert tickets were for classical music last year. The average classical record sells only 300 copies. I don't understand why. The older people blame our love of TV and video games, but I don't think that's the reason. The truth is that classical music is not popular with most people, especially teenagers. I know some teenagers who like classical music, but they are rare. I like different types of music, but I don't listen to much classical music myself. So, why don't teenagers like classical music? One reason is that classical music is slow and has many changes in mood. We like to talk, play, and think fast. We also have trouble paying attention for more than three minutes, which is too short for most classical music. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music needs time and attention. Pop music also talks about things that interest teenagers. Classical music is powerful, but it's not about the things that teenagers care about. The way we listen to music has changed too. We used to listen to music at home with our families, and playing an instrument was important. Now, we can find any music we want on the computer, and classical music is not popular. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? My teacher says that more people are going to classical concerts, but I think most of them are not teenagers. I play in an orchestra, and I see mostly older people at our concerts. I don't know why people like classical music more when they're older, but I know that if your parents like something, you might not like it too. Some people say that schools are to blame for not teaching classical music well, but there are kids who love playing classical music in school. They practice before school and after school. Classical music is fun for them when they play it, but they don't like it otherwise. The two things have become separate. When we want to relax, we always listen to pop music.""

'I started playing the guitar when I was six and writing songs when I was seven,' Cody says. 'But I loved swimming and surfing more. I was 13 and going to school. I posted some videos online and people liked them. They wanted more videos. So I recorded more and people loved them. I was a good swimmer and was training hard. But then some music companies wanted me to work with them. I had to make a choice: stay in Australia and swim or move to the US. I chose to move to the US. It was hard for me to decide. I had to tell my swimming coach and friends that I was leaving. They were surprised. I'm a quiet person and I like to keep things simple. My family is important to me. They're not famous, but they're always there for me. Sometimes I worry about how my decision affected my little brother and sister. But my family says they're always there to support me. Success comes from saying ""yes"" to big opportunities, even if it's scary. Cody says it all happened quickly and unexpectedly. Now he's playing in front of many people and traveling to new places.

My mom was there and said, ""Good morning, Rex. You're up early today."" I said, ""Thanks, Mom."" Then I saw my grandfather in the hallway. He was grumpy as usual.

There was a river in it, but it didn't look like a real river. The riverbank was very small and hard to see. There were no animals, no birds, no people. Jess liked the picture. It felt peaceful. Mum said, ""It has a name."" Jess read the words: ""River Boy."" She didn't know why it was called that. Mum said, ""It's strange that Grandpa gave it a name. He usually doesn't."" Jess looked at Mum. ""There is no boy in the picture."" Mum said, ""Yes, it is strange. Maybe Grandpa will add a boy later."" Jess knew what Grandpa would say about the picture. He would say that each painting has its own life and language, and we either understand it or we don't. Mum asked Jess if she knew anything about the painting, because she seemed to inspire Grandpa.

My bedroom is a small room under the roof, and it's shaped like a wedge of cheese. There are no corners in my room, so I was trying to find a way to fit the cabinet in.

It was hard because people who love the book had strong ideas about how it should be. I used pictures from the book to help me. The author wanted the show to be from the Borrowers' point of view, not the humans'. It was hard to make it look right because the Borrowers are very small. We had to film from far away and crawl on the ground. We had to make sure the shadows looked right. We found a special way to do this. A famous director, George Lucas, called me to ask how I did it. We built a special set for the Borrowers' home. The actors had to carry big things, like giant scissors. It was funny. We also had to make sure the costumes were right. The actors had to wear heavy clothes that looked like doll clothes. It was hard for them to move. We filmed most of the show in front of a blue screen. The actors had to imagine things that weren't there. I drew pictures of each scene to help them. It took a long time, but it was worth it. The show was successful and people liked it.'

Teenagers can't just go to school and not do anything. They must try their best. Many people think that teenagers are lazy, rude, and only care about themselves. But this is not always true. Teenagers have a lot of work and responsibilities. They have homework, tests, and jobs, and they must also take care of their social life.

They often don't get enough sleep and have to get up early to do it all again the next day. Some teenagers volunteer to help others and make a positive impact in their community.

'The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in a small town called Bishop. They like to launch balloons into the sky to study the stars. They have done this many times before. One weekend, they launch a special balloon to see shooting stars. These are bright streaks of light that appear when small rocks or metal pieces enter the Earth's atmosphere.

The students put a special box on the balloon with a camera, a tool to measure how high they are, and a thermometer to see how hot or cold it gets. They also put two special trackers on the box so they can find it later.

The balloon gets bigger and bigger until it is as big as a small car. The students count down and then the balloon goes up into the air. They watch it with flashlights until it disappears into the night.

After the launch, some students go home, but a few stay to look for shooting stars. They lie on blankets and look at the very clear sky. It's hard to believe that just a few hours away is a big city with many people.

The students are very happy to be in the mountains, far away from the city. They like the adventure of finding their balloon and the equipment inside. They have only lost two boxes in 53 launches. They like to explore the wilderness and get to know the area better.

This time, the box landed 84 km away from Bishop. It took the students 11 hours to find it. They were very happy when they finally found it. They didn't find any shooting stars, but they were happy to have had an adventure and to have learned more about the stars and the air.'<|eot_id|>"

Chloe likes to explain science to people. She thinks it's important to help people understand science and not have wrong ideas. She likes to talk to children about dinosaurs because it helps them learn about the world.

Chloe worked on a TV show about dinosaurs. She checked that the dinosaurs were correct and that they lived at the same time. She was happy to help.

But when you finally get there, it's not ""there"" anymore, it's ""here"". So, you should ask ""Are we here yet?"" instead. Moms and dads get tired of answering ""Are we there yet?"" many times. They want to relax and have some peace. Kids, wouldn't you rather sit in the back seat and watch a movie, listen to music, or do a puzzle? Your mom or dad will help you and make sure everything is okay. But sometimes, your brother or sister does something naughty, like putting their foot on your side of the seat. Then, you might get mad and fight. The driver and co-pilot will tell your brother or sister to stay in their own seat. Then, everything is calm again. After a while, you might feel a cold breeze on your arm. It's because your brother or sister is blowing on you. You might get angry again. 

Dad has some tricks to make us kids behave on the car trip. For example, he says ""We're here. Get out of the car."" But you're still on the highway! So, he says ""Oh, maybe we're not there yet."" That makes us quiet for a while. You know you're finally ""there"" when you see the grown-ups get out of the car and go away from us kids.

I was a bit skeptical at first, but after seeing him do some stunts, I was amazed. He's very brave, creative, and willing to take risks. Before he does a stunt, he tells me what he's going to do, and sometimes I don't think he'll make it. But he always does! When I told him how cool he was, he didn't seem to care. He doesn't like being famous, but he likes doing what he loves.

Tony thinks that the camera technology helps him make a living. He's happy that people can watch his videos and enjoy them. But he also thinks that too many people are looking at screens all the time and not doing things in real life. He's not complaining, though. He's making a good living doing what he loves.

I've interviewed many athletes before, and I think there are two important things that make someone great: energy and being able to handle disappointment. Tony fell a few times when he was trying new things, but he just got up and kept going. Some people think he's reckless, but he says they don't understand the sport and the risks he takes are minimized with expert advice.

Tony knows that people are different, and some are more scared than others. He's not addicted to risk and spends a lot of time planning and preparing. He knows he can't let his nerves get the best of him before he tries something new. If he focuses and commits, he's fine.

'Ana Ronson is a singer-songwriter from Ireland. She grew up in a house where music was always playing. Her grandfather taught her and her brother how to play the guitar. Ana was very nervous when she sang in front of her school class for the first time. Her teacher thought joining the school theatre club would help her feel more confident. Ana liked singing with her friends in the club and even wrote a song for her brother's band. She liked writing songs so much that she took a special course to learn more. Ana's teacher didn't listen to her ideas, so she wrote a song about how she felt. Many people liked the song and left nice comments. A man from a music company called Isotope Music wanted Ana to join them. At first, Ana was unsure, but he promised she could write her own songs. Ana performed at a concert in Dublin and it was a big success. She likes to write songs about things that are important to her, like when her brother stopped singing for a while. Ana hopes people will like her songs, but she wants to write about her own experiences.'

'I went on a trip to the west coast of Canada last year. My brother Harry, who is a journalist, wanted to write about it. He loves boats, but I don't. I had always wanted to visit this place because my great-grandparents used to live there. I asked Harry if I could come, and he finally said yes. Before we left, there were bad storms, but the weather was supposed to be good when we got there. Harry took care of everything, so I didn't worry. We joined a group and took small boats. We saw dolphins and birds, but not many people. We stopped on beaches and looked at the fish in the rock pools. We made our own food over campfires. It was nice to not have to worry about time. When we slept on the boats, it felt like we were living without stress. When it was time to leave, I was sad. I didn't want to go back to my normal life. But I knew I would miss my family and friends. I was excited to tell them about our adventures.'

I made the following changes:

* Simplified vocabulary: I used simpler words and phrases, such as ""went on a trip"" instead of ""travelling by boat"", ""loves boats"" instead of ""a great fan of boats"", and ""made our own food"" instead of ""made dinner"".
* Reduced sentence complexity: I combined some sentences to make them shorter and easier to understand.
* Removed unnecessary details: I removed some details that were not essential to the main story, such as the exact dates and the fact that the guide mentioned that few people lived along the coast.
* Changed sentence structure: I used simpler sentence structures, such as simple sentences instead of complex ones with multiple clauses.

I practiced every day for four years and did well. I even played with grown-ups before I moved to the USA when I was 15. The coach there was very good and I learned a lot. I missed my parents at first, but I got used to living away from home. My English got better too! I became a professional basketball player at 18.

'In the UK and other countries, there is a big change in education. Now, students are encouraged to do research early on in their studies. This is because research is not just for famous professors or scientists. It's a way for everyone to learn and grow. Research helps you think critically and solve problems. It's not just about memorizing facts, but about asking questions and finding answers.

You might already be doing research without realizing it. For example, when you're planning a trip or fixing something around the house, you're using research skills. At school, you're expected to think critically and come up with your own ideas.

Some people might find it hard to question what they're told and think for themselves. But in the UK, US, and other countries, it's important to question what you read and hear.

""Cities are important places for learning and thinking. A long time ago, people in London would meet in coffee shops to talk about new ideas. Today, people in Paris meet in cafes to talk about art. But city life can be hard. The same coffee shops that helped people think also spread diseases. Some famous artists, like Pablo Picasso, left the city to live in the countryside.

Scientists are now studying how cities affect our brains. They found that cities can make us think less well. One reason is that we don't have enough nature around us. Studies show that people who can see trees from their hospital windows get better faster. Even just looking at nature for a little while can help our brains work better.

Most people now live in cities. This is a big change. We used to live in the countryside, but now we live in big cities with many people. This can affect our health and how we think. When we walk in a city, we have to pay attention to many things, like other people and cars. This can be tiring.

Scientists have found that our brains need to work hard to pay attention in cities. This is because there is so much to see and hear. Nature is different. It's easier to relax and think in nature.

Some people think that cities are good for our brains because they help us meet new people and have new ideas. This is true, but we need to make sure we also have some time in nature to relax and think. The key is to find a balance between the city and nature.""

Where do we find our thoughts? This might seem like a strange question. We know that our brains are inside our heads, and we have special machines that can see what's going on in there. But I think we should look beyond our skin and skull to understand our minds. Many things, not just our brains, help us think. For example, tools, clothes, and even writing can help us learn and remember.

Archaeologists have found many old things that show us how people used objects to help them think and solve problems. This makes me think that what's outside our heads might be part of our minds too.

Most of what we know about our brains comes from studying people who are alone in a special room. This helps scientists learn about our brains, but it makes us forget that we often think with things outside our heads. I'm not saying that our brains aren't important, but I think we should look at how our minds work with the world around us.

I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). It says that our minds work with things to help us think. We use things like sticks, stones, and clay to help us solve problems and learn. This idea helps us understand how our minds work and how they have changed over time.

Think about a person who is blind and uses a stick to feel their way around. Where does their self begin? The stick is part of them, and it helps them understand the world. This shows us that our minds are always changing and adapting to new things.

I think our minds are always growing and changing, and that's because we use things to help us think. This is what I call metaplasticity. We have special minds that can change and grow as we use things.

I want to show that our minds are connected to the things we use. This idea is not new, but it's important to remember that we've been using things to help us think since we first existed.

Historians say that photography is America's greatest contribution to the visual arts. This is because photography is a big part of American life and has been for a long time.

Photography was appealing because it was a new and exciting technology. People liked that it could capture images quickly and easily. They also liked that it could show them things they had never seen before, like faraway places and famous people. Photography was also a way for people to show off their families and themselves.

Photographs are special because they are real and honest. They show us what really happened. But they can also be changed by how we look at them. For example, a picture of a person might mean one thing to one person and something else to another.

'William James, a famous American thinker, defined psychology as the study of our thoughts and feelings. This idea is still important today. We all have thoughts and feelings, and we know what they mean to us. But psychology is hard to understand because it's hard to study our own minds. James thought that our thoughts and feelings come from our own experiences and what we learn from others. We use our own thoughts and feelings to make decisions and understand others. Sometimes we think we know why people behave in certain ways, but this is not always true. Psychologists try to figure out why people behave in certain ways. They study how people behave and use this information to make guesses about what's going on in their minds. It's like solving a puzzle. Psychologists want to understand how our minds work, just like we want to understand how machines work. They want to know what makes us happy, sad, or angry. They want to help people feel better and understand each other better. Psychology has helped us in many ways, like teaching children to read or making machines safer. People have been thinking about psychology for a long time, but only recently have they been studying it scientifically. In the past, people tried to understand their own thoughts and feelings to figure out why they behaved in certain ways. But this method had its limits.

He wanted to collect new products, but he didn't know that most products fail. So, he ended up with many failed products.

People might think that companies would want to learn from their mistakes, but they often don't. They might keep spending money on a product that doesn't sell well. This is because they don't want to admit they made a mistake. There's a big idea in marketing that if you think positively, good things will happen. But, a scientist named Tali Sharot found out that people often think things will go well, even if they're not true. A psychologist named Gabriele Oettingen did some research and found that thinking about how well things could go actually makes people less motivated to work hard. It's like if someone tells you to think about how great you'll be at a job, but then you don't actually do any work to get good at it.

A psychologist named Carol Dweck says that how we think about failure is important. Some people think that ability is fixed, like a talent you're born with. Others think that ability grows with hard work and practice. People who think ability is fixed are very upset when they fail. But, people who think ability grows with hard work see failure as a chance to learn and get better.'

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a learner of level A1:

""Playing at home is an advantage for sports teams. But why is that? Some people think it's obvious, but experts are studying this. Two groups are looking at this: scientists and people who work with money. Scientists want to know how players perform well. People with money want to know why playing at home matters. They think that if players are paid well, they should feel comfortable anywhere.

But what about fans? Would it matter if Manchester United played some games in a different country? Fans would miss their team's games at home. Fans like to think that their team needs their support to win. This might be because we remember things in the wrong order. We remember when we cheer and the team scores a goal. We forget when we cheer and the team doesn't score.

One thing is true: fans shout at the referee. Researchers did an experiment. They showed referees a match with sound and a match with no sound. Referees who heard the sound were less likely to call fouls against the home team. This is because referees don't want to make the crowd angry.

Some people study how teams do over time. They found that home advantage is smaller now than it used to be. This might be because players travel more easily now. But why does home advantage change depending on the sport? Basketball is a sport where playing at home is most helpful. Football is next. Baseball is a sport where home advantage is less important. Maybe this is because baseball is more about individual players. In team sports, players work together and feel more confident at home.

Some researchers think that players' feelings of territoriality, or defending their home, might be connected to a strong desire to win. Players' testosterone levels are higher before home matches. This might be because they feel like they need to protect their home turf.""

'Gary Player, a famous golfer, said, ""The more I practice, the luckier I get."" But what did he really mean? He was being funny and saying that the more he practiced, the better he got. This idea is popular among athletes and coaches. But some people think it's not that simple. They ask, ""Is it natural talent or practice that makes someone good at something?""

There are many books about this topic. One famous book says that if you practice for 10,000 hours, you can become an expert. But another book says this is not always true. The author of this book, Epstein, thinks that it's not just about practice. He says that some people are naturally good at things, and that's because of their genes.

Epstein looked at many examples to understand this better. He even went to Alaska to learn about sled dogs! He found that the dogs' drive and desire to work are important, and that might be because of their genes. This makes us think about whether our drive and determination are just because of our choices or if they're also because of our genes.

Epstein says that both nature (our genes) and nurture (our environment and training) are important. He thinks that if he had grown up in a different place, a famous runner named Usain Bolt might have become a good basketball player instead. But Epstein also looked at cases where genes are very important. He even talked about how men and women are treated differently in sports. He asks, ""If practice is the only thing that matters, then why do we separate men and women in competitions?""'

Here is the simplified version of the text, adapted for a learner of English at level A1:

Many children in rich countries are unhappy and lonely. Jay Griffiths asks: why are they so unhappy? In her book, Kith, Griffiths says that children are unhappy because they spend too much time indoors, looking at screens, and don't go outside to play. They don't know the natural world, like woods, mountains, and rivers. This is the main problem.

A study found that children said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many grown-ups also remember their own childhoods as happy times when they played outside. They think their children's lives are too safe and controlled.

Griffiths argues that parents are afraid of danger and keep their children indoors, which helps the toy and gadget industry. She also talks about how some schools prescribe medicine for children who are restless or make them wear goggles for playground games. Griffiths thinks this is silly and wants children to have more freedom.

However, Griffiths sometimes goes too far and doesn't listen to the other side of the argument. She thinks children are naturally good and should be allowed to take risks. She says that children need to have some small accidents to learn how to avoid bigger ones. But she doesn't say how we can make this happen.

Some people might not agree with Griffiths' ideas. They might think that not all children want to take risks or explore the outdoors. Maybe the problem is that we force all children to be the same, either by keeping them indoors or pushing them to be adventurous.

Here is the simplified text, suitable for a level A1 learner:

'I am a psychologist. I have a PhD and have done lots of school. But, I think that school is not the best way to learn. Most problems in life are not solved by formulas or memorized answers. They need creativity and wisdom, which come from experiences. Children learn these things through play. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Children play a lot because they have a lot to learn. Play is a natural way for people to learn.

The most important skills children need to learn are not taught in school. These skills, like thinking creatively, getting along with others, and controlling their emotions, are learned through play. Creativity is important for success. We need people who can think for themselves and solve new problems.

Adults who are good at thinking creatively are often called geniuses. They still have the ability to think like children. Albert Einstein was a genius who loved to play and think creatively.

Children are born to play with others and this helps them learn social skills and be fair and kind. Play is voluntary, so children can stop playing if they want to. This makes play a democratic activity.

Unfortunately, school has become too serious. Children have less time to play and are often supervised by adults. We need to give children more freedom to play and explore so they can grow up to be strong and healthy adults.'

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to find a job. They think it's a good way to get noticed by employers. But it's not always easy. A young jobseeker in the US sent a message to a famous marketing executive on LinkedIn. The executive had many important people in her contacts. But she didn't want to share them with a stranger. She sent a mean message that went viral. Many people were upset. The jobseeker might have learned an important lesson. Social media can be a good tool for finding a job, but you need to use it carefully.

When we were teenagers, social media was our way to escape from our parents and teachers. We used it to impress our friends and pretend to be someone we're not. But when we use social media for work, it's different. We need to be professional and respectful. Many young people are making mistakes on social media. They think that just because many people liked their posts on Facebook, they will get a job. But it's not the same. We need to learn how to use social media correctly.

Employers often complain that young job seekers are too familiar and seem arrogant. This makes them think we're not serious about finding a job. But many of us are very serious. We're just not using social media correctly. To get a good response on a professional networking site, we should explain who we are and what we can do for the other person. We should also be humble and not send impersonal messages.

Remember, social media can be a good way to make contacts, but we need to use it carefully.<|eot_id|>"

Newspapers are in trouble. Many people don't read them as much as they used to. Since 2000, the number of people who read newspapers has gone down. Some people think that soon, there won't be any printed newspapers left. But, old media like newspapers have a habit of surviving. They have survived many changes before, like the invention of radio, TV, and the internet.

In the past, newspapers were new and exciting. It took a long time for them to become popular. This was because it was hard to print and send news to many people. But, people started to want to know what was happening in the world. They wanted to know about news and events.

Now, we have the internet. We can get news quickly and easily. We can even get news on our phones. But, some people think that newspapers are not doing a good job of telling us what's going on. They think that newspapers are more interested in getting attention than in helping us understand the world.

In the past, people got news by talking to each other in the market or in a pub. It was hard to know what was true and what was not. Now, we have the internet, and we can get news quickly and easily. But, maybe newspapers can still be helpful. They can help us make sense of the world and understand what's going on.

'The world is very different at night. If we were meant to be awake at night, we would be happy in the dark. But we are not. Our eyes are used to the light of the sun. This is a basic fact that is in our genes. We don't think about it much, but it's the reason we don't like the dark. We've tried to make the night brighter by using lights. This is like building a dam to control a river. It's good, but it also has problems. We call this problem ""light pollution"". It's because we don't use lights properly. We shine them up into the sky, not down where they're needed. This makes it hard for some animals to find their way and live. In the past, people didn't have many lights, so the night was much darker. Imagine walking in London at night a long time ago. You would have seen very little light. Now, we have many lights and they make the night brighter. But this is not good for some animals. They get confused and can't find their way. Some birds even fly into buildings because of the bright lights. We need darkness to be healthy. It's like our body needs a special rhythm to work properly. If we don't have this rhythm, we can get sick. We are like animals that live near a bright highway and can't escape the light.

The boss says employees can take as much holiday as they want as long as they are sure it won't harm the company or their job. But is it possible to be really sure? There will always be work to do when you come back from holiday. This can make people feel guilty and stressed. It's better to have a set amount of holiday time so people can relax and come back to work feeling fresh. Some companies have a culture of working late, so people might feel they need to work all the time. This could make people not take holiday at all or feel too guilty to take it.

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level A1:

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it's like a painting with words. But I don't think that's enough. One day, I asked my students to choose an object and write two paragraphs about it. One paragraph should describe the object like a scientist, and the other paragraph should be from the object's point of view. One student chose an oxygen mask. It's not a usual choice, but it helped us understand what poetry can do.

I didn't like poetry when I was at school. It seemed like a puzzle that didn't make sense. But now I think poetry is special. It's not like other writing. When we read a poem, we might not understand it at first, but it can still be interesting. We might feel something or think about something new. Sometimes we look for poems to make us feel happy or sad, or to teach us something. But poetry can also be confusing. It's like a puzzle, but a puzzle that can make us think.

What do we want from poems? We want them to be beautiful, interesting, and maybe even funny. But we can find those things in other things, like movies or music. Poetry is special because it can be unclear. This is like our everyday lives, where things are not always clear. When we look up the word ""poem"" in a dictionary, it says it's a form of writing that uses language in a special way. But the word ""poem"" comes from an old Greek word that means ""thing made."" So, what kind of thing is a poem? Poets compare poems to animals or machines, but these comparisons don't work well. The important thing is to think about what a poem is and what it can do.<|eot_id|>"

'Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel. But I don't talk about it much because I feel a little shy. When my friends tell me about their trips and all the things they do, I just smile and don't say much. They might think I'm lazy if they knew that I like to take long naps in the afternoon and sleep in late in the morning.

When I went to Mexico, I slept a lot. I slept for more than 12 hours a day! It was nice because I was far from home and didn't have to worry about anything. I could sleep deeply and have nice dreams.

I think sleep is important when we travel. It helps us feel relaxed and refreshed. And when we sleep in a new place, we can dream about all the new things we saw and experienced. I like to sleep in different places because it makes me feel like I'm really there.

Sometimes it's hard to sleep in a new place because it's different from what we're used to. But it's worth it because we can learn about the new place and its culture. For example, when I was in Trinidad, people woke up early and then took a nap in the morning. It was hard for me to adjust at first, but eventually I got used to it.

I thought about it and decided to join Ben. We had to pay a lot of money for the boat and equipment. We also had to think about how much money I would lose by not working. As a retired athlete, I make money by speaking at business events. But I don't like talking about my old achievements without having a new goal. Rowing across the Atlantic would be something new and exciting. We prepared for the race, and I learned a lot. But I also learned to appreciate my easy life as an athlete. I was worried about what people would think of me racing with a TV presenter, but I was surprised by how much we worked together and how much we learned from each other.'<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a learner of level A1:

'I left my job and moved to the Arctic Circle in Finland to work with huskies. I was 26 years old and wanted a change from the noise and crowds of London. I found a small company that takes tourists on dog sled rides in the snow. They had six dogs at first, but soon had over 100. I joined the team for three months and started packing right away.

I was a bit worried on my flight, but the bus ride to the farm was nice. We drove through a dark forest with snow-covered trees. When I arrived, I was given a pair of boots and went outside into the cold. The dogs were excited and barking loudly. I met some of the other team members and we went on a sled ride in the dark.

It didn't take long to learn how to drive the sled, but I had to learn some new skills like chopping wood and using an axe. It was hard work, but I was happy to be doing something new.

After a week, I was tired but proud of what I had learned. I could do some new things, like chopping wood and using a saw, in the snow.'

'Paula Radcliffe was a very good runner. She ran a marathon very fast. The press came to ask her about it. They wanted to know about a special oil she used to help her heal from an accident. She got hurt when she ran into a bike while training. Radcliffe said she didn't think about how fast she was running. She just did it. Her coach and her husband were with her during the race. They were worried she might get too tired. But she kept going. She was very strong.

After the race, people asked her how she was so good. Her coach said she was very dedicated. She would train every day, even when she was tired. Paula said she didn't know why no one else could run as fast as her. She thought it was because she worked hard and never gave up.

Paula's marathon was very special. It was her best time ever. She didn't run as fast again, but many women started running because of her.'

""I made a cooking show called 'In Search of Perfection'. I was worried about how people would like it. Would they like learning about food history, nostalgia, and science? The show was a success, and it led to other projects, like a book about my restaurant. In each project, I go on a journey to learn new things. I wrote several books called 'Perfection', each one about a different TV show. In these books, I travel to different places to meet people who make food. In my latest book, 'In Search of Total Perfection', I visit people who make special food, like a man who makes golden pasta. These people have spent a long time trying to make their food perfect. Perfection is different for everyone. Choosing which dishes to include in the book was hard, but we found a list that everyone liked. I think that each of us has our own idea of what is perfect, based on our own feelings and memories. I didn't claim that my recipes are the best, but I tried to learn about what makes good food. I went to many places to find the best ingredients and met many people who make food. I even tried some unusual things, like milking a cow and making ice cream!""

I minimized changes to the factual content of the passage, while simplifying the language and sentence structure to make it accessible to learners at level A1. I removed some complex vocabulary, such as ""nous"" and ""itineraries"", and rephrased sentences to make them easier to understand.

My mum and sister started laughing. We couldn't stay there forever. The field was big and green with flowers. We saw poppies and daisies. 'We can't stay here,' I said. My sister was worried. John went to find someone who could help. We sat on the side of the road and waited. My mum lay down on the grass. 'Tell us a story,' she said. I told them about two birds I heard talking. They talked about breadcrumbs and the weather. They even had an argument about a worm. My sister didn't believe me. 'That's silly,' she said. 'No one understands bird language.' I felt sad. My mum fell asleep in the sun. John came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to a hotel. My sister didn't want to get out of the van. The boys smiled and waved at her. We went into the hotel café. It was near where our van was. We had tea made from mint leaves. It was very sweet. We stayed there all day while John fixed the van. 'It's a miracle it got us this far,' he said. We went to sleep in the hotel garden. The next day, we got a truck to tow our van to Marrakech. My sister didn't want to move, so John picked her up and put her in the truck. Now she's sitting in the front with the driver. I'm worried about how we'll get home now that our van is broken.'

'My dad says I spend too much time on the internet. I asked experts what they think about social media. They say most teenagers who use social media have many friends, feel good about who they are, and learn important skills. Simon Miles says social media is a part of modern life. Teenagers don't just use it to check emails or buy things, they live it. It's not good or bad, it depends on what you do with it.

Jim Matthews says social media is like a virtual youth club where we can share jokes and gossip with friends. It helps us learn to be ourselves and deal with problems. Professor Keith Davidson says social media can help us find our identity and make friends with people who like the same things as us. He says it's good for people who are shy because they can talk to others online without feeling nervous.

Professor Andrew Phillips says social media is good for people who like special things, like music or sports. We can find others who like the same things and talk to them. Pauline White says social media is a way to be creative. We can make videos, podcasts, and write blogs about things we like. We can also share photos and learn from others. This will help us when we grow up and get a job.

Experts agree that social media is important for the future. We need to know how to use it to help businesses and make friends. We can also work with others to make things and share them with others. This is an important skill for the 21st century.'

My mom and dad kept saying it. My brother and I looked at each other and thought, 'Why not?' We packed our bags and got in the car. We drove for a long time, through many states and one province in Canada. We saw many new things and had some exciting adventures. We saw big mountains, beautiful sand dunes, and even a big park with bears. We stayed in a small hotel with no internet or phone. It was old and creaky, but we loved the view. We saw a big storm from our hotel window and felt happy to be together. When we got back home, we looked at all our photos and remembered the fun we had.

Miranda Ellington is a choreographer. She is 25 years old. She makes dance shows for many theaters and dance groups. Sometimes she also dances herself. I don't understand why she does both. She says that dancing again reminds her of what it was like when she was a dancer and had to follow the choreographer's orders. She didn't like that.

As a choreographer, Miranda likes working with young dancers. They are open to new ideas and don't know what they are good at yet. This makes it easier to teach them. When Miranda starts working with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. She has to make the best dance routine for the music, even if she doesn't like the music.

Miranda doesn't like working with the same people all the time. She likes to work with different people and adapt to their way of working. This means she can't get too used to one way of working.

I asked Miranda about a documentary about ballet dancers. She said it showed what life is really like in a dance company. She said it's hard work and people don't understand how much effort it takes.

I asked Miranda what makes a great dance show. She said it's when everything comes together - the music, the costumes, the lighting, and the dancers. It's hard to get everything perfect, but it's worth trying.

Miranda has done many different types of dance. I asked her if she is a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist. She said people want to put her in a box, but she doesn't want to be limited to one type of dance. She wants to try new things.

We had talked to each other by email before we left, but we didn't have much time to chat before our first swim. Our guides told us that a boat would follow us and help us if we needed it. We did a short swim to split into groups, then did a longer swim. I was a bit nervous because I'd never swum that far in the sea before. The waves got bigger and I was swimming with the slow group. I wanted to finish the swim, and I was happy when I did it. The next days were the same: we swam, stopped to look at the view, and then swam again. As we swam farther, I got faster and felt happy.

The show was very popular in the USA, where it was voted the best musical four times. But it was hard to find actors in the UK who could do the show. The UK has rules about how many shows actors can do each week. In the USA, they can do more shows. So, twice as many actors were needed in London. The director found many talented UK actors, and they won their first award.

The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA. But it's always full every night. People love the songs from the show. I met a boy named Jamie who is one of the actors. He's 11 years old. He said it's great that he gets paid to play his guitar. He plays a special guitar called a Gibson. Jamie told me that the young actors are very busy. They have school lessons every day at the theatre. They miss their old friends, but they like the show.

The theatre gives special deals on tickets for schools. Jamie's whole class came to see the show, and they loved it. Jamie was happy because his parents can't always come to the show because it's expensive. I also play guitar, so Jamie lent me his guitar and we played a song together. I was happy when I got it right! Jamie is very good at playing the guitar. I wish I could play like him.

The young actors had to learn to play together. They were worried that they would make mistakes. But they found it easy to play together. The hard part was smiling when they first performed.
