Some years ago, a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins on social media. The site argued that by sharing your whereabouts, you're not just telling friends where you are, but also advertising your presence to everyone, including people you may not want to meet. This confirmed the growing awareness that there are downsides to sharing our lives online. While the internet offers many opportunities to share our thoughts and experiences with a global audience, it also poses risks. We may share too much, too soon, and regret it later. This is a lesson that pioneers of the internet, known as bloggers, learned many years ago.
In the early days of the web, these pioneers shared their personal stories, photos, and experiences online. They faced challenges, such as losing friends and jobs, and dealing with the consequences of their online actions. They paved the way for the rest of us, showing us what can happen when we share too much online.
Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, was one of the first bloggers. He started posting his personal thoughts and experiences online in 1994. He shared his life with the world, including photos and art. His blog became popular, and people came to see what he was up to. However, he faced challenges, including losing his home page and dealing with the consequences of his online actions.
Heather Armstrong, a young web worker, also shared her life online. She wrote about her job and personal life on her blog, but her employer found out and fired her. This is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they wouldn't say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and we must be careful what we share.
Armstrong learned a valuable lesson and eventually started a new blog focused on her family life. She is now a successful ""mommy blogger"" who uses her writing to support her family. Her story teaches us that while the internet allows us to share our thoughts and experiences, we must be mindful of the consequences of our actions.

'A while back, some scientists started a campaign to warn people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? The film combines documentary and drama to show that there's a lot we don't understand about our universe. While it's true that scientists can be a bit arrogant, no one claims to have all the answers. Some scientists felt compelled to issue public warnings, describing the film as 'atrocious' or 'dangerous'. This sparked curiosity, and I had to see the film for myself. Initially, I didn't understand the fuss, as scientists were simply stating that new discoveries were revealing the universe to be stranger than expected. However, when the film explained these discoveries, I began to see why it was so controversial. For example, it discussed the ability of water molecules to be affected by thought. I had heard of this before, but the film's evidence was limited to pictures of ice crystals changing shape depending on the mood of those around them. While some people find this convincing, scientists require more substantial proof. The film's claims are indeed astonishing, but without concrete evidence, they remain speculative. The real issue is that the film's claims aren't bizarre enough. In reality, discoveries are being made that prove the universe is far stranger than we thought. For instance, astronomers have found evidence of an unknown form of matter and a mysterious force driving the universe's expansion. Similarly, neuroscientists have discovered that our perception of events is delayed by half a second, and anthropologists have identified the birthplace of modern humans. Theories are emerging that link the existence of life on Earth to the fundamental design of the universe. Despite what some might believe, science is far from complete. In fact, we're further away from omniscience than ever. The concepts of chaos and quantum uncertainty have put limits on what we can know. Theories aside, many of us believe the universe is best summed up in one word: incredible.'

Writing novels is a challenging task for me, while writing short stories is a joy. The process of writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is like tending a garden. Both processes complement each other, creating a complete landscape that I treasure. The trees in the forest provide shade, and the wind rustles the leaves, sometimes turning them a brilliant gold. In the garden, flowers bloom, and their colorful petals attract bees and butterflies, reminding us of the changing seasons. Throughout my writing career, I have alternated between writing novels and short stories. After finishing a novel, I often feel the need to write some short stories, and vice versa. I never write short stories while working on a novel, and never write a novel while working on short stories. The two types of writing may engage different parts of my brain, and it takes time to switch between them. I started writing short stories in the mid-1980s, after publishing two short novels in 1975. At first, it was a challenging experience, but it expanded my creative possibilities and allowed readers to see a new side of me as a writer. One of my early short stories, 'Breaking Waves', was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad. Writing short stories is appealing because they don't take as long to complete. It usually takes me about a week to draft a short story, although revisions can be ongoing. This is in contrast to writing a novel, which can take a year or two. Writing short stories provides a welcome change of pace and allows me to explore ideas that might not be suitable for a novel. I can create a story from a single idea, word, or image, often allowing the story to unfold spontaneously. I also appreciate that I don't have to worry about failing with short stories. Even experienced writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver have not always written masterpieces. I find this reassuring, as it allows me to learn from my mistakes and use them to improve my next story. In fact, I often use my short stories as a way to experiment and learn from my experiences, which helps me when writing novels. Without short stories, I would find writing novels even more challenging. My short stories are like personal mementos, reminders of the emotions and experiences that inspired them. They are like guideposts to my heart, and I am happy to share them with my readers."

Science is a complex and multifaceted field that has both improved our lives and posed threats to our existence. It has made significant progress in understanding the natural world, from the smallest particles to the vastness of the universe. However, this progress has not been without controversy, as established theories have been constantly challenged and modified. Scientists have often been driven by a desire to prove their theories, which has led to conflicts and rivalries. Despite this, science has led to numerous breakthroughs and innovations that have transformed our understanding of the world and our ability to manipulate it.
Science has also had a significant impact on society, influencing fields such as medicine, technology, and politics. It has the power to shape our future and determine the kind of world our children will inherit. As such, it is essential that non-scientists understand the implications of scientific advancements and be aware of the potential consequences of scientific discoveries.

From around 2015, major publishers started to notice that ebook sales had stopped growing and in some cases had even decreased. This raised doubts about the long-term potential of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some publishing executives admitted that the hype around ebooks might have led to unwise investments. Despite this, the question of whether ebooks will replace print books still sparks debate. The idea that a new technology will 'kill' an existing one is not new. We have seen this pattern throughout history, from the invention of radio to the rise of digital technologies. Each time, critics have predicted the demise of an old medium, but it often ends up adapting to the new technology.
The idea of the 'death of the book' is not new either. As early as 1894, people speculated that the phonograph would replace books with audiobooks. This pattern of predicting the end of an old medium has happened repeatedly. Movies, radio, television, and smartphones have all been accused of replacing print books, but they have coexisted. The debate about the death of the book is not just about the technology itself, but also about our emotional attachment to it. We form strong bonds with objects like books, TVs, and computers, and the emergence of a new technology makes us adjust to the loss of something familiar.
As technology advances, we often long for what we used to know and have. This is why industries develop around retro products and older technologies. The spread of the printing press, for example, led people to seek out original manuscripts. The shift from silent to sound movies and from analog to digital photography also stimulated nostalgia for the older forms. Similarly, the rise of e-readers led to a new appreciation for the material quality of 'old' books and even their distinctive smell.
This should reassure those who worry about the disappearance of print books. However, the idea of the disappearing medium will continue to be a compelling narrative about the power of technology and our fear of change. One way we make sense of change is by using familiar narrative patterns, such as the story of tragedy and ending. The story of the death of the book is a reminder of our enthusiasm for what lies ahead and our fear of losing parts of our intimate world – and ultimately, of ourselves.

Every day, for a year and a half, I got up at 5:30 am and started my day by writing about how famous people, including artists, writers, and scientists, managed to be creative and productive. I wanted to show how their daily routines, including when they slept, ate, and worked, helped them achieve their goals. By sharing these details, I hoped to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers.
The idea for this book came to me on a Sunday afternoon when I was supposed to be writing an article, but instead, I was procrastinating by tidying my workspace and making coffee. I started browsing the internet for information on how other writers organized their daily routines and found it fascinating. I realized that there was a need for a book that collected these anecdotes in one place.
I started a blog where I shared these stories, and later, I expanded the collection and researched more thoroughly for this book. I tried to keep the same tone and variety of voices that made the blog popular. I used quotes from the original sources, such as letters, diaries, and interviews, to let my subjects speak for themselves. In some cases, I summarized their routines from secondary sources.
I want to acknowledge the work of the many biographers, journalists, and scholars whose research I built upon. I have listed all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide for further reading.

One of the most significant developments in higher education in the UK and internationally is the emphasis on involving students in research from the early stages of their studies. This recognises that research is not only for renowned scholars or scientists pushing the boundaries of knowledge, but also a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are valuable not only in academia but also in the workplace, as they involve critical thinking and problem-solving.
As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions, exploring, and finding answers. You don't just accept information; you make it. Research is about questioning, investigating, and finding new insights. It's a continuous process that involves asking 'why', 'how', and 'what if'.
Research can be complex and groundbreaking, but it can also be everyday and practical. You may have already been conducting research in your daily life, such as exploring a new place, trying a new recipe, or solving a problem. In higher education, you are expected to develop your research skills, think critically, and evaluate information.
Some students may struggle with this approach, as they may be used to accepting established knowledge and authority. However, in UK, US, European, and Australian higher education, it's expected to question and challenge established knowledge. Critical thinking is essential in research, as it helps you to engage with information, think critically, and identify potential biases.
It's important not to take information at face value and to question what you read and hear. You should evaluate evidence, identify potential flaws, and consider alternative perspectives. By doing so, you'll develop your research skills and become a more informed and critical thinker.

Cities have long been the hub of intellectual life, from 18th-century coffee houses in London to modern-day cafes in Paris, where artists like Pablo Picasso would discuss modern art. However, city life is not without its challenges. The same cafes that stimulated discussion also spread diseases like cholera, and even Picasso eventually left the city to live in the countryside. Despite being a hotbed of creativity, cities can be overwhelming and unnatural places.
Researchers have been studying how cities affect our brains, and the results are surprising. While it's well-known that city life can be exhausting, new research suggests that cities can actually dull our thinking. One reason for this is the lack of nature in urban areas. Studies have shown that patients recover faster when they can see trees from their hospital windows. Even brief glimpses of nature can improve brain function by providing a mental break from the urban grind.
As humans have become increasingly urbanized, with the majority now living in cities, it's essential to understand the impact of urban surroundings on our mental and physical health. Cities can powerfully alter how we think, and it's crucial to find ways to mitigate the negative effects while maintaining the benefits.
For instance, natural settings don't require the same amount of cognitive effort as urban areas. The mind is like a powerful computer, but paying attention consumes a lot of processing power. Natural environments are full of objects that capture our attention without triggering negative emotions, allowing our attentional machinery to relax and replenish itself.
Philosophers and landscape architects have long warned about the effects of the city and sought ways to integrate nature into urban life. Urban parks, such as New York's Central Park, provide an escape from city life and can improve brain function within minutes.
Recent research has shown that the same urban features that trigger lapses in attention and memory – crowded streets and close proximity to others – also correlate with measures of innovation. The concentration of social interactions is responsible for urban creativity, just as the crowded nature of 18th-century London led to intellectual breakthroughs.
The key is to find a balance between mitigating the psychological damage of the city and maintaining its unique benefits."

Where is the mind located? This might seem like a strange question, as we often assume that thinking takes place inside our heads. However, I don't see any compelling reason why the study of the mind should stop at the skin or skull. There is plenty of evidence from prehistory to the present day that shows that objects, not just neurons, play a role in human cognitive life. From an archaeological perspective, it is clear that stone tools, body ornaments, and writing systems all contributed to human evolution and the development of the human mind. Therefore, I suggest that what is outside our heads may not necessarily be outside our minds.
It is easy to see why people often equate the mind with the brain. Most of what we know about the human mind has been discovered by studying people in isolation from their material surroundings. This makes sense for neuroscientists, who use brain-scanning machines. However, it often goes unnoticed that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads. I'm not questioning the neural basis of cognition, but rather pointing out that the mind is more than just the brain.
Instead, I propose exploring the idea that human intelligence extends beyond the skin into culture and the material world. This is where my Material Engagement Theory (MET) comes in. MET investigates how things become cognitive extensions of the human body, such as when we create numbers and symbols from clay or use a stone to create a tool. It also examines how these ways of thinking have changed over time and what those changes mean for our understanding of the mind.
This approach provides a new perspective on what minds are and what they are made of, by changing our understanding of what things do for the mind. For example, a blind person using a stick to navigate their environment is a good illustration of this concept. The stick becomes an extension of the person's body, and the brain treats it as such. This reminds us that human intelligence is capable of drastic reorganisation through the incorporation of new technological innovations. My approach sees the human mind as an ongoing project, constantly evolving.
It is important to remember that the ""stick"" can take many forms – from ancient stone tools to modern technology. Its primary function is as a pathway, not a boundary. Through the ""stick"", humans discover, make sense of, and shape their environment, and in doing so, shape their minds. This unique human predisposition for engagement with material culture explains why we humans make things, and how those things, in turn, shape our minds. I call this metaplasticity – we have plastic minds that develop and change as they interact with the material world. I want to bring materiality back into the cognitive equation. MET offers a new way of understanding how different forms of material culture have provided a powerful mechanism for defining and transforming what we are and how we think."
