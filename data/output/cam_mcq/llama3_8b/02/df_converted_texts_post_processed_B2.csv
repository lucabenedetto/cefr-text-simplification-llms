Some time ago, a website warned about the risks of sharing your location online. The site said that when you post about where you are, you're not just telling your friends, but also strangers, including some you might not want to meet. This confirmed what many people were already realizing: that sharing our lives online can have negative consequences.
The internet offers many opportunities to share our thoughts, photos, and stories with a global audience. We can become famous or wealthy, but we also risk saying something that we might regret. Some people have already experienced this. In the early days of the internet, a group of pioneers, known as bloggers, explored these risks and consequences.
One of these pioneers was Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student who started posting his life online in 1994. He shared his thoughts, photos, and art, and people were fascinated. However, he soon faced problems. His online friends and even his romantic partner were upset by his openness. He realized that sharing his life online could affect his relationships and reputation.
Another example is Heather Armstrong, a young woman who started a blog called Dooce in 2002. She wrote about her job and personal life, but an anonymous colleague discovered her blog and sent it to her bosses, who were not happy. Armstrong lost her job as a result.
Experts have a term for this phenomenon: the ""online distribution effect."" It's the feeling that we can say things online that we wouldn't dare say in person. However, our online and offline lives are connected, and what we post online can have real consequences.
Heather Armstrong learned a valuable lesson. She stopped blogging for a while, got married, and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a successful ""mommy blogger"" who uses her writing to support her family. Armstrong's story shows that we should think carefully before sharing our lives online.
The main idea is that the internet offers many opportunities to share our lives, but we should be careful not to say something that we might regret. We should remember that our online and offline lives are connected, and what we post online can have real consequences."

Some scientists were concerned about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know?, which combined documentary and drama to show that there are many things about the universe that we don't understand. This is a fair point, as even the most confident scientists wouldn't claim to know everything. However, some scientists were so upset about the film that they publicly criticized it, calling it ""atrocious"" and ""dangerous"". This made me curious, so I decided to watch it.
For the first 20 minutes, I didn't see what all the fuss was about. Scientists were talking about how new discoveries were showing that the universe is stranger than we thought. It wasn't until the film started explaining these discoveries that I began to understand what all the fuss was about. For example, did you know that water molecules can be affected by our thoughts? I had heard of this before, but the film showed some amazing evidence, including pictures of ice crystals changing shape depending on the mood of the person talking to them.
Many people find this idea compelling, but scientists are skeptical. They want more proof before they accept it. I agree with them. While the idea is amazing, we need more evidence to be sure it's true. The film didn't provide enough proof, just some nice pictures.
But the truth is that the universe is still full of mysteries. Scientists have made some incredible discoveries recently. For example, they've found that the universe is made of a type of matter we don't understand, and that it's being propelled by a mysterious force called ""dark energy"". They've also discovered that our brains can't process reality in real-time, and that our ancestors left Africa to populate the world. These discoveries show that there's still much we don't know.
Despite what some people think, science is not complete. In fact, we're further away from knowing everything than ever. The concepts of chaos and quantum uncertainty have shown us that there are limits to what we can know. Some scientists are trying to create a single equation that explains everything, but many of us think the universe is just incredible."

Here is the simplified text, written at a level B2:
Writing novels is a big challenge for me, while writing short stories is a joy. Writing a novel is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both processes are important and help me as a writer. The forest and the garden complement each other, creating a beautiful landscape that I love.
When I finish writing a novel, I often want to write some short stories. When I finish a group of short stories, I feel like focusing on a novel again. I never write short stories while I'm working on a novel, and I never write a novel while I'm working on short stories. This helps me switch between the two types of writing.
I started writing short stories in 1984, and it was a new experience for me. I learned a lot and felt my writing possibilities expand. Readers appreciated this new side of me as a writer. One of my early short stories, ""Breaking Waves"", was included in my first short-story collection, Tales from Abroad.
I like writing short stories because they don't take as long to finish. It usually takes me about a week to write a decent short story, although revisions can take longer. Writing a novel can take months or even years, which can be overwhelming. Writing short stories is a nice change of pace for me.
Another advantage of short stories is that I can create a story from a small idea or image. It's like improvising jazz, and the story takes me where it wants to go. I don't have to worry about failing with short stories. If an idea doesn't work out, I can just move on to the next one. Even experienced writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver don't always write masterpieces. I find this comforting.
Short stories are like an experimental laboratory for me as a novelist. They help me learn from my successes and failures, which makes me a better writer. Without short stories, I would find writing novels even more difficult. My short stories are like footprints I've left behind, and I remember exactly where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are like guideposts to my heart, and it makes me happy to share these feelings with my readers."

Here is a simplified version of the text, making it suitable for a learner of level B2:
Science is a complex and multifaceted field that has both improved our lives and threatened our existence. It has helped us understand the universe, from the smallest particles to the vastness of space. Science has also influenced many areas, including art, politics, and philosophy. However, its beauty and importance are not always apparent to everyone, and its limitations and fallibility are often overlooked.
Throughout history, science has been characterized by conflict and controversy. Established theories have been challenged and replaced by new ones, often after being initially ridiculed. Scientists have strong personalities and can be passionate about their work, leading to disagreements and conflicts.
This book explores the development of scientific ideas that have changed the course of science and human thought. While science has many practical applications, this book focuses on the ideas themselves, examining their beauty, limitations, and potential impact on society.
Science is constantly evolving, with new discoveries often leading to new theories and challenges to existing ones. This process can be slow and gradual, but it has led to significant advances in our understanding of the world. For example, our understanding of the universe has changed dramatically since the 17th century, with new discoveries and theories emerging in the 20th century.
However, science is not without its challenges and limitations. It has the potential to harm as well as benefit society, and its development must be carefully considered. As we continue to advance our knowledge and understanding of the world, we must also be aware of the potential consequences of our actions.
In the end, science is not just an intellectual pursuit, but a powerful tool that can shape the future of humanity. As such, it is essential that we understand its potential and its limitations, and work to ensure that its development is responsible and beneficial for all."

Here is a simplified version of the passage for a B2 learner:
For several years, the sales of e-books grew steadily. However, around 2015, major publishers started to notice a decline in e-book sales, or even a complete stop in some cases. This led to doubts about the long-term future of e-books in the publishing industry. Some people even think that the hype around e-books might have led to unwise investments. Despite the fact that e-books and print books can coexist peacefully, the idea of e-books replacing print books still sparks a lot of debate.
Why do we worry about the disappearance of print books? It's not just about the technology itself, but about the emotional bonds we form with different media. We develop strong connections with objects like books, TVs, and computers, and when a new technology emerges, it can be unsettling. We might start to miss the old way of doing things and even develop a nostalgia for it. This is why we often see a resurgence of interest in older technologies, like vinyl records or film cameras.
The idea of the death of the book is not new. People have been predicting the demise of books since the invention of the phonograph in 1894. The same pattern has repeated itself with the advent of radio, television, and the internet. We tend to frame the introduction of new technologies as a struggle between old and new, even when the evidence suggests that they can coexist.
The idea of the death of the book is a narrative that taps into our hopes and fears about technology and change. It's a way for us to make sense of the unknown and to process our emotions about it. By understanding this narrative, we can see that it's not just about e-books and print books, but about our relationship with technology and our desire to hold on to what we know and love."

For almost two years, I started my day at 5:30 am. I brushed my teeth, made a cup of coffee, and sat down to write about how famous people from the past 400 years managed their daily routines. By looking at the small details of their daily lives, such as when they slept, ate, and worked, I wanted to give a new perspective on their personalities and careers. The idea is that knowing what someone eats or when they take a nap can reveal a lot about who they are.
This book is about the daily habits of creative people, not just their work. It's about how they organized their time to be productive and creative. I also wrote about my own struggles with balancing creative work and earning a living. How can you do meaningful work and still make a living? Should you focus on one big project or work on many small ones? And what do you do when you don't have enough time for everything?
I don't claim to have the answers, but I share examples of how successful people have dealt with these challenges. I wanted to show how big ideas can be broken down into small daily tasks. How your daily habits can affect your work and vice versa.
The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but I focused on people's routines. A routine can be ordinary and unthinking, but it can also be a powerful tool for making the most of your time, energy, and optimism. A good routine can help you stay focused and avoid being controlled by your mood.
The idea for this book came from a lazy Sunday afternoon when I was supposed to be working on a story, but instead, I was tidying my office and making coffee. I realized that many writers have unusual working habits, and I started searching the internet for information about them. I launched a blog and eventually turned it into this book.
I've included quotes and summaries of famous people's routines from their letters, diaries, and interviews. I also drew on the research of many biographers, journalists, and scholars. You can find all my sources in the Notes section, which I hope will also serve as a guide for further reading."

Howard became interested in paleontology when he was six years old. His family had planned a trip to Spain, but due to a rise in interest rates, they had to cancel it. Instead, they went to the English coast and Howard found an ammonite on the beach. This sparked his interest in paleontology. As he grew older, Howard became more focused on the early stages of the Earth's history, rather than the more spectacular dinosaurs. He studied delicate creatures that lived on the surface of rocks. After completing his PhD, Howard was unsure if he would get a job at a prestigious institution. He applied for a position at Tavistock College in London, but wasn't sure if he would get it. At the interview, the professor who was supposed to chair the panel had an argument with his wife and didn't show up. Instead, a colleague who didn't like Howard's supervisor took over the interview and surprisingly, Howard got the job. Months later, a colleague explained that the professor who replaced him was trying to help him out. Howard was relieved to have the job and could finally do the work he loved.
Later, Howard found himself contrasting his professional life, where he could plan and achieve his goals, with his personal life, where things didn't always go as planned. One day, his briefcase containing his lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station. He reported the theft and postponed his lecture. While waiting for a new briefcase, he met a colleague who was with a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard learned about a new collection of fossils that had not been cataloged or identified, and he knew that studying them would be his biggest challenge and secure his professional future. Without the theft, he might not have discovered this opportunity. Within an hour, Howard changed his plans and decided to go to Nairobi to study the fossils."

Professor Charles Spence is a food scientist who loves trying new and unusual foods. He and his team at Oxford University are studying how our senses work together to create the taste of food. They have discovered that many things can affect what we taste, such as who we eat with, the color and texture of the plate, and even the background noise. Spence's research is helping the food industry create new and interesting foods. He has worked with famous chefs and food companies to develop new products. For example, he helped a well-known food company reduce the amount of salt and sugar in their products without changing the taste.
Spence's research is also being used in restaurants and even in airplanes. He has found that the type of music we listen to can affect how we taste food. For example, higher-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, while lower-pitched music makes it taste bitter. Spence's team is also studying how different shapes and colors can affect our perception of food.
At home, Spence and his family like to have fun with food too. They have had dinner parties where they have eaten unusual foods, such as rabbit with the fur still on. They have also used special equipment to test how different sounds and colors can affect the taste of food. For Spence, food is not just about eating, but about exploring how our senses work together to create our experiences.

Our brains are constantly bombarded with information, and we have to sort through it all to find what we need. At the same time, we're doing more things on our own, like booking flights and making purchases online. We're trying to juggle many tasks at once, but our brains aren't designed for multitasking. When we think we're doing multiple things at once, we're actually switching between tasks quickly, which can be tiring and stressful.
Multitasking can make us less efficient and even affect our mental health. It can increase the production of stress hormones, making it harder to focus and think clearly. Our brains are also easily distracted, and the constant need for external stimulation can lead to a craving for more.
Research has shown that multitasking can reduce our ability to focus and make us less intelligent. Even having the opportunity to multitask can be detrimental to our cognitive performance. In fact, trying to focus on a task while checking email can reduce our IQ by almost 10 points.
Multitasking can also affect how we learn new information. When we're doing multiple things at once, new information goes into the wrong part of our brain, making it harder to retrieve later. Decision-making is also hard on our brains, and making many small decisions can lead to making bad decisions about important things.
Email is a major source of stress for many people, and it's not just the act of checking email that's the problem, but the sheer volume of messages we receive. We feel pressure to respond to emails, but it's hard to do so and get anything else done.

In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino broke concrete into pieces to throw at visitors. Was he being mean? In the US, female bats help other female bats have their babies. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought animals just did things without feelings or morals. But now, scientists are studying animal emotions, like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens. This has started a big debate: do animals have feelings and moral rules like humans do?
Recently, scientists did an experiment with cows. They had to open a gate to get food, and those that opened it themselves seemed happier than those that didn't. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does that mean for eating beef? Some people think it means we should stop eating meat, while others think we should just think about animal intelligence more.
There are different opinions on this topic. Some scientists think we should stop eating meat because animals have feelings and moral rules. Others think we should just think about animal intelligence and not overthink it. The main problem is that defining what it means to be conscious is very hard. Can we ever really know what it's like to be another animal? A scientist did an experiment with starlings and found that they can get depressed if they live in small, unpleasant places. This shows that animals can have negative emotions like humans do.
Some people think that our view of animals will change in the future, just like our view of racism has changed. They think we should not eat animals and support animal rights. Others think we should just be more aware of animal intelligence and not overthink it. The debate is ongoing, and it's hard to say who is right."

Critical thinking is a way to understand and analyze what we read or listen to. Adrian West, a researcher, believes that argument is a way to find the truth. However, he also thinks that technology is changing the way we think. We are exposed to more information, but this can be overwhelming and make it harder to think critically.
West notes that we are exposed to a lot of poor or misleading information, which can be hard to distinguish from good information. This can lead to poor decision-making. Moreover, having a lot of information does not necessarily mean we are more knowledgeable or make better decisions.
The amount of data and information available has not improved the quality of our thinking. In fact, the National Endowment for the Arts reports that the amount of literary reading has decreased by 10 percentage points. Some experts believe that the decline in reading has contributed to a decline in critical thinking.
However, the impact of technology on critical thinking is not clear-cut. Technology can be both good and bad, and different types of technology can have different effects. For example, a computer game can promote critical thinking or hinder it.
Patricia Greenfield, a psychologist, has studied the effects of technology on learning and found that visual media can improve some types of information processing, but they do not allow for reflection, analysis, or imagination. Reading, on the other hand, can develop imagination, critical thinking, and vocabulary.
James Paul Gee, an educational psychologist, believes that video games can be a good tool for learning and can even improve critical thinking skills. Games like Sim City and Civilization teach decision-making and analytical skills in a virtual environment that resembles the real world.
In conclusion, technology has changed the way we think, and it's essential to understand the subtleties of how it affects our thinking and analysis."

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic and writer. He used to work in an office, but became disillusioned with the job. His books explore the benefits of manual work and how to deal with modern life. In his latest book, he talks about the challenges of living in a world where we're constantly interrupted by advertisements and notifications.
Crawford noticed that even when we're not actively using our phones, we're still affected by the constant stream of information. This makes it difficult to focus and think deeply. We're also becoming less likely to have conversations with strangers and more likely to prefer online interactions.
Crawford argues that we're losing the ability to engage with the world in a meaningful way. Instead, we're surrounded by representations of people and things, rather than experiencing them directly. For example, at the gym, people used to listen to music together, but now everyone listens to their own music on headphones.
Crawford suggests that we need to find ways to engage with the world in a more satisfying way. He believes that this can be achieved through ""skilled practices"" - activities that require us to focus on the present moment and interact with others. Examples of skilled practices include cooking, playing ice hockey, and riding a motorcycle. These activities help us develop our judgment and ability to manage our relationships with others.
Crawford argues that by engaging with the world in this way, we can resist the constant distractions and develop a greater appreciation for the things that truly matter. This can bring many benefits, including increased focus and a greater sense of connection with others."

When we meet someone new, we often ask, ""What do you do for a living?"" It's a simple question that usually gets a quick answer. But for a philosopher like me, it's harder to answer. Saying I'm a philosopher can sound pretentious, like I'm claiming to be special or have some kind of secret knowledge. But that's not true. Philosophers are just people who think deeply about life and the world.
One reason people might think philosophers are special is because we're often seen as critics who judge others and celebrate intellectual life. The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of contemplation was the most virtuous one. While many modern philosophers wouldn't agree, there's still a sense that philosophy is connected to intellectual pursuits.
Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that an unexamined life is not worth living. This means that we should think about our daily experiences and decisions to make sure they are meaningful. It's not just about reading books or being a genius; it's about taking the time to reflect on our lives.
Unfortunately, philosophy has become disconnected from everyday life. Many philosophers focus on technical debates and write for other experts, making it hard for others to understand. This has led to a misconception that philosophers are removed from reality. To change this, philosophers need to share their ideas with a wider audience.
I often describe myself as an ethicist, but I'm starting to think that's not enough. Ethics is often associated with formal rules and laws. However, philosophy is about exploring bigger questions, like how we think about responsibility, art, and consumerism. By examining these ideas, we can gain a deeper understanding of our lives and the world around us. This can help us make better decisions and live more thoughtfully.

Here is the simplified text, tailored for a B2 level learner:
Foodies and chefs might expect that thinking deeply about what and how we eat can make eating more enjoyable. However, philosophers have rarely focused on food itself. Instead, they have used food as a metaphor to discuss other topics, such as the pursuit of knowledge. Some philosophers have talked about the importance of pleasure and avoiding pain, but they haven't specifically focused on food.
The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus advocated for the pursuit of pleasure and avoiding pain, but his ideas are often associated with enjoying food and drink. This is surprising, as Epicurus didn't just talk about eating. Food is a social and cultural aspect of our lives. The food we eat comes from our community and is often shared with others.
Philosophers have neglected to explore the way we perceive food, which is surprising given how often we eat. Food critics are not experts in taste, but rather good at describing what they taste. This is an area that needs more attention.
Food can also be beautiful, like art or music. However, it is temporary and ephemeral, unlike other aesthetic objects. This raises questions about whether food can be considered beautiful at all.
There are also ethical issues surrounding food, such as what we should eat and why. Philosophers will ask questions about these issues and explore the answers. Cooking at home is different from cooking in a restaurant, as home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests. Cooking in a restaurant, on the other hand, involves obligations to the employer and the food itself.
Food can also play a role in bridging cultural gaps. We can learn to appreciate other cultures by trying their food and sharing meals together. This has a long history in international diplomacy. The essay ""Diplomacy of the Dish"" explores this idea and provides many interesting examples and anecdotes to illustrate it.

Rob Daviau, an American game designer, created a new type of board game called ""legacy"" games. He wanted to make games more exciting and challenging. In a legacy game, players make decisions that have a lasting impact on the game. For example, they might tear up cards or change the board. The game is played over several sessions, and players can see how their decisions affect the game.
Daviau's first legacy game was Risk Legacy, a version of the classic game Risk. Then, he worked on a legacy version of the popular game Pandemic. In Pandemic Legacy, players work together to stop diseases from spreading. Daviau's next project was a game called SeaFall, where players become sailors exploring the high seas.
Designing a legacy game is a complex process. The designer must think about all the possible choices players can make and how they will affect the game. To do this, they test the game with players to see how it unfolds. One player, Jaime Barriga, said it takes a lot of time and effort to test a legacy game.
At first, Daviau thought legacy games would only appeal to a small group of people. But many players loved the idea. Russell Chapman, a fan, said it's a new level of excitement and commitment in board games. Ben Hogg, another fan, said the appeal of an unfolding adventure is what makes legacy games so popular.
The legacy format is influenced by video games and TV shows. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, compares the process of designing a legacy game to writing a novel. Daviau is happy to see where others take the idea, but he thinks gamers will soon be looking for something new. Colby Dauch, a game publisher, believes the legacy format has changed the way people think about board games.

Not long ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at a New Zealand aquarium. He climbed out of his tank, crawled across the floor, and squeezed into a narrow drain that led to the Pacific Ocean. This amazing story was widely shared online. People love stories about animals escaping, especially when they're as clever as Inky. Octopuses are known for their intelligence, which is hard to understand because their bodies are so different from ours. How can an octopus open a jar, recognize faces, or even play with toys? Dr. Frans de Waal, a scientist who studies primates, thinks that it's not anthropomorphism (giving human-like qualities to animals) that's the problem, but rather our reluctance to recognize the human-like traits of animals, which he calls anthropodenial.
Dr. de Waal analyzed decades of research on animal intelligence and found that many animals can do things we thought were unique to humans, such as thinking about the past and future, showing empathy, and understanding others' intentions. In other words, animals are smarter than we give them credit for.
In the past, people didn't think animals were as intelligent as they are now. In medieval times, animals were even put on trial for crimes! And in the 19th century, scientists like Charles Darwin believed that the difference between human and animal intelligence was just a matter of degree, not kind.
The 20th century saw a shift in how people viewed animal intelligence. Behaviorism, which focused on conditioning animals through rewards and punishments, became popular. As a result, many people thought of animals as either machines that responded to stimuli or robots with useful instincts. Anyone who thought animals had internal lives was seen as romantic or unscientific.
However, Dr. de Waal believes that we are now moving away from this view and recognizing that animal cognition is on the same spectrum as human intelligence, just at a different point. He thinks that the best way to test animal intelligence is to design tests that take into account the animal's unique abilities and skills.
The story of Inky the octopus has sparked a lot of interest in animal intelligence, and Dr. de Waal believes that viral stories like this can help us appreciate just how smart animals are. He even ran an experiment to see if capuchin monkeys can experience envy, and the results were surprising. The study was published in a scientific journal, but it was a video clip of the experiment that really convinced people of the findings."

The field of robotics is about to change the way we work and live. Robots have been used in factories for a long time, but now they are going to be used in many other areas too. Experts think that many jobs will be replaced by robots, and some people are worried about this. Many people think that robots will take over most of the jobs currently done by humans in the next 50 years, but they also think that their own jobs will not change much. However, this is not true. Robots will affect all industries in the next few years.
For example, a company in Australia has created a robot that can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, which would take two human bricklayers a whole day to do. Another robot, called Tally, is used in supermarkets to make sure the shelves are stocked and priced correctly.
Some people think that robots will create new jobs for technicians and programmers, but others are worried about the loss of human touch in work. Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert on robotics, says that robots will change the way we work and that people need to be prepared.
In the next few years, more robots will be able to work with each other and with humans. Many companies will have a person in charge of robotics, and governments will create laws to regulate robots. The salaries in the robotics industry will increase, but there will also be a shortage of skilled workers.
Dr. Zhang says that people need to adapt to the changing job market by retraining themselves. He also thinks that robots will be used in our homes and will interact with us in new ways. This will create new opportunities for companies, but also new challenges, such as making sure we are safe and private.
To prepare for the future, we need more people to study science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM). This will help us stay competitive in the job market and adapt to the changes brought by robots."

Many people wonder why climbers risk their lives to climb mountains. One famous climber, George Mallory, said ""Because it's there."" This answer is simple, but it reminds us that sometimes we climb just for the adventure and fun. Climbing can be a challenging and thrilling experience.
A Bolivian writer, Tejada-Flores, identified different types of climbing activities, each with its own rules. He believed that the way we climb depends on the type of game we're playing. For many climbers, climbing is about feeling free and unrestricted. However, it can also be confining and restrictive, especially when stuck in a tent during a storm.
There is a paradox in climbing: it can be both freeing and confining. Some argue that the limited options available make the climber's life simple and free in its own way. A US rock climber, Joe Fitschen, suggests that we should ask ""Why do people climb?"" rather than ""Why climb?"" He believes that climbing is in our nature, and we climb because it's an instinct to take on challenges and test our limits.
Climbing can also help us develop important virtues like courage, humility, and respect for the environment. An academic, Brian Treanor, argues that climbing can cultivate these virtues, which are essential in today's risk-averse world. Climbing can also be a way to develop a sense of commitment and perseverance, as those who climb independently have to rely only on themselves to succeed.
Some experts believe that independent climbers deserve more recognition because their achievements are harder and riskier. However, this idea has sparked controversy, as some argue that it may encourage climbers to take unnecessary risks. Climbing can also be a way to connect with nature and experience a sense of flow, which is a common experience reported by many climbers. In fact, climbing has been compared to Zen philosophy, as it requires focus, discipline, and a state of mindfulness."

Here is a simplified version of the text, targeted at a B2 level learner:
In recent years, there has been a shift in education towards encouraging students to get involved in research from the beginning of their studies. This recognizes that research is not just for famous scholars or experts in specific fields, but a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills are useful not only in studies but also in the workplace, as they help you think critically and solve problems.
As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions and finding answers. You don't just memorize information; you create it. Making knowledge involves asking questions like ""Why?"", ""How?"", ""What does this mean?"", and ""What if...?"" Research is a way of thinking about the world and approaching your own work.
Research can range from complex, groundbreaking projects to everyday investigations that involve careful work and thoughtful questions. Most students have already been conducting research in some form, whether it's for a school project or personal interests. You've probably asked questions and looked for answers since you started studying.
In higher education, you're expected to develop your research skills by exploring ideas, evaluating information, and constructing your own responses. This might seem daunting, but it's an important part of learning. Critical thinking is key in research, and it's essential to engage with the work of others, think critically about what you read, and test ideas.
As a student, you should not just accept information at face value but question it, think about it, and identify potential biases. You should also be aware of how information is presented and whether it's logical and evidence-based. By developing your research skills, you'll become a more independent and critical thinker, prepared for your future studies and career."

Cities have always been important places for learning and creativity. Think of the coffee shops in 18th-century London, where people would gather to discuss new ideas, or the cafes in modern-day Paris, where artists like Pablo Picasso would talk about modern art. However, city life is not always easy. The same coffee shops that sparked interesting conversations also helped spread diseases like cholera. Even famous artists like Picasso eventually left the city to find peace and quiet.
Now, scientists are studying how cities affect our brains. They have found that city life can actually make us less intelligent. One reason for this is that cities lack nature. Studies have shown that patients in hospitals recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even small glimpses of nature can improve our brain function, as they give us a break from the stresses of city life.
For the first time in history, most people live in cities. Instead of living in open spaces, we are surrounded by concrete and millions of strangers. This can affect our mental and physical health, and even change the way we think. Imagine walking down a busy street, trying to avoid pedestrians, cars, and crossing the road. This requires a lot of mental effort, and can leave us feeling drained.
Cities are so full of stimuli that our brains need to constantly redirect our attention. This takes a lot of energy and effort. In contrast, natural settings don't require as much mental effort. This idea is called attention restoration theory. Psychologist Stephen Kaplan first proposed it, saying that being in nature can be restorative for our minds.
Long before scientists studied this, philosophers and architects were warning about the effects of city life and looking for ways to bring nature into cities. Urban parks like Central Park in New York can provide a break from city life and even improve our brain function. In fact, taking a walk in a natural place can be more effective than many other methods for improving cognitive performance.
So, why do cities continue to grow, despite the challenges they present? Research at the Santa Fe Institute found that the same features that can make cities stressful – crowded streets and close proximity to others – are also what make them creative hubs. The concentration of social interactions is what drives innovation, just as the crowded streets of 18th-century London led to intellectual breakthroughs.
The key is to find ways to mitigate the negative effects of city life while maintaining its benefits. As the saying goes, ""I'm sick of the trees, take me to the city!"""

Where should we look for the mind? It's a question that might seem strange, but it's not as simple as just looking inside our heads. We use special machines to study our brains, but that doesn't mean the mind only exists in our heads. There's a lot of evidence that shows how things, not just our brains, are involved in our thinking and learning.
From a historical perspective, it's clear that objects, like stones, ornaments, and writing systems, played a big role in human evolution and the development of the human mind. So, it's possible that what's outside our heads is still part of our mind.
Most of what we know about the human mind comes from studying people in isolation, which is useful for scientists who need to use special machines. However, this can make us forget that a lot of our thinking happens outside our heads. I'm not saying that our brains aren't important, but I do think that our minds are more than just our brains.
I've developed a new theory called Material Engagement Theory (MET), which looks at how things become a part of our thinking and learning. For example, when we make numbers and symbols with clay or use a stone to make a tool, those things become extensions of our bodies. MET also explores how these ways of thinking have changed over time and what that means for how we think.
This new approach gives us a better understanding of what minds are and what they're made of. It also shows us that our minds are constantly changing and evolving as we use new technologies.
Think of a blind person using a stick. Where does their self begin? The stick is an extension of their body, and it helps them to ""see"" the world. This example shows us that our minds are very adaptable and can change in response to new technologies. I believe that our minds are always evolving and that we're constantly incorporating new things into our thinking.
I call this ability ""metaplasticity"" – our minds are plastic and change as we interact with the world around us. I want to emphasize the importance of material culture in our thinking and learning. MET offers a new way of understanding how different objects, from stones to smartphones, have helped shape what we are and how we think.
It might seem like a futuristic idea, but humans have been using technology to change their minds since the beginning of time."

Photography has had a huge impact on the way we live and understand the world. In the United States, photography became an important part of the country's culture, influencing many areas, from science and industry to art and entertainment. Many historians consider photography to be the US's greatest contribution to the visual arts.
So, why was photography so popular? Firstly, it was a new technology that matched the growing interest in science and innovation in the US. Just as trains, electricity, and steam power made communication and travel easier, photography brought the world into people's homes in a way that was both exciting and convenient. Secondly, photography was a way to capture and share images of oneself, which was important in a country where people believed that their identities were constantly changing and evolving. Thirdly, the camera allowed people to create and share records of their families, even if these records were sometimes idealized.
Photographs are unique because they are both objective and subjective. They show us what was in front of the camera, but they also reflect the photographer's perspective. This makes photography a complex medium that can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is seen.
Photography has also become an important tool for artists, who have used it in their work in various ways. In fact, photography has become an essential part of art, allowing artists to represent the world in new and innovative ways.

William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the'science of mental life' in 1890. This definition still helps us understand psychology today. We all have a mental life, and we have our own ideas about what that means. However, psychology is not just about human thoughts and feelings; it's also about how we understand the world around us and how we know things. Our knowledge is mainly based on our own experiences and thoughts, which may or may not be influenced by scientific facts.
When we make judgments about psychological matters, we often rely on our own personal experiences and opinions. For example, we might think we know why someone behaves in a certain way or why we feel a certain emotion. However, this can lead to misunderstandings when we discuss psychological issues with others. Psychology tries to provide a more objective way of understanding these issues by using scientific methods to decide which explanations are most likely to be correct.
Psychologists study the brain and behavior to understand how our minds work. However, they don't fully understand how the brain works, and it's difficult to study directly. Instead, they observe people's behavior and use that information to make educated guesses about what's going on in their minds.
The challenge in studying psychology is that the workings of the mind are not directly observable like an engine. We can only infer what's going on inside our minds by observing our behavior. It's like trying to solve a crossword puzzle, where we need to evaluate and interpret the clues carefully.
Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes it studies. By achieving these goals, it can help us understand our experiences and make conclusions that can be applied to real life. Psychological findings have been useful in areas such as education, machine design, and helping people who are emotionally distressed.
Psychology has a long history, dating back centuries. Early psychologists relied on introspection, or reflecting on their own thoughts and feelings, to understand the mind. However, this method has limitations. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than personal experiences.

In a storage facility in Michigan, USA, there is a unique collection of failed products, known as the Museum of Failed Products. The museum's owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has its own story about what went wrong. The most surprising thing about the museum is that it is a successful business. Many companies do not keep track of their failed products, but the museum's owner, Robert McMath, started collecting products in the 1960s, not realizing that most products fail. 
The culture of optimism in business and marketing can lead to products being developed without considering their potential failure. Marketers may invest more money in a failing product to make it seem like it is still viable. This can lead to a lack of discussion about what went wrong with the product. 
The concept of ""positive visualization"" is popular in the self-help industry, where people are encouraged to imagine a positive outcome to increase the chances of it happening. However, research suggests that this approach can actually decrease motivation to achieve goals. 
Psychologist Gabriele Oettingen found that thinking about how well things could go can actually decrease motivation. On the other hand, psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that people's experiences of failure are influenced by their beliefs about ability. Those who believe that ability is innate may find failure more devastating, while those who believe that ability can be developed through hard work and challenge may view failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. 
Dweck suggests that having an incremental mindset is a happier and more effective way to approach challenges, even if it does not always lead to success."

Playing at home gives sports teams an advantage, but why is that? Many of us think it's obvious, but professional sports are changing fast, and what we used to take for granted is no longer true. Two things have changed our understanding of home advantage: science and money.
Scientists want to know what makes players perform well, and they have come up with many theories about home advantage. Meanwhile, people who make money from sports want to know why home advantage still matters. If players are well paid, shouldn't they feel comfortable anywhere?
Fans might think that their team needs their passion and loyalty, which could be why they confuse cause and effect. When a team scores a goal, the crowd cheers, and fans remember that the cheering started when the goal was scored. But they forget all the times the team didn't score.
One thing that seems to be confirmed by science is that home fans shout at the referee. In an experiment, referees who heard a recording of a match with crowd noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team than those who heard a silent recording. This matches what actually happens in real matches.
Recent studies have looked at how home advantage has changed over time. They found that home advantage has decreased in most sports, but not as much as you might expect. One reason might be that travel used to be difficult, but now teams travel in comfort. Stadiums are also becoming more similar, which might make it harder to explain home advantage.
Despite these changes, home advantage still varies from sport to sport. Basketball and football have the biggest home advantage, while baseball has the smallest. One reason might be that baseball is more about individual players, while team sports like basketball rely on teamwork. This teamwork builds confidence, which is boosted by playing at home.
There's another possibility: players' testosterone levels increase before home matches, which could be linked to a primal urge to defend their territory. This sense of territoriality might be what drives teams to play better at home.
As one referee put it, ""It's the law of the jungle out there."""

Gary Player, a famous golfer, once said, ""The more I practice, the luckier I get."" But what did he really mean? He was being ironic, and his real message was that the more he practices, the better he gets. This idea is at the heart of a debate about whether talent is something you're born with or something you can develop through practice.
The debate has been going on for a long time, and many people think that practice is more important than natural talent. This idea was popularized by a psychologist named Anders Ericsson, who said that it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert in any field. Many books have been written about this idea, and they all seem to agree that practice is what matters most.
But some people, like author Epstein, disagree. He thinks that the debate is too one-sided and that we need to look at both nature and nurture. He believes that some people are just naturally better at certain things, and that practice can only take you so far. Epstein looks at many examples, from athletes to sled dogs, to show that there is more to success than just practice.
He also looks at the issue of race and gender, asking why we separate men and women in athletic competitions if practice is the only thing that matters. Epstein's book is a fascinating exploration of this complex topic, and he raises many important questions that challenge our assumptions about what it takes to be successful.

A recent report shows that many children in wealthy countries feel unhappy and lonely. Jay Griffiths, an author, has written a book called Kith, which explains why children are unhappy. She thinks that children are spending too much time indoors, looking at screens, and not enough time playing outside in nature. This is the main problem.
A study that followed up on the report found that many children said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults also remember their own childhoods fondly, when they spent long days playing outside and exploring. They think that this is better for children than the protected lives they have now.
Griffiths argues that the fear of danger that makes parents want to keep their children indoors is linked to the toy and gadget industry, which wants to sell them things to keep them entertained. She also criticizes the trend of prescribing medication for restless children and the rules that make children wear goggles for playground games.
Griffiths is a passionate writer, but sometimes she goes too far. She doesn't consider the other side of the argument and sometimes makes unfair comparisons. She thinks that children should be allowed to take risks and explore the outdoors, but she doesn't explain how to do this safely. Some children might not want to take risks, and that's okay too.
The main idea of the book is that children should be allowed to be independent and make their own choices. Griffiths believes that children need to experience some danger to learn how to manage it. However, she doesn't explain how to achieve this safely, and it's not clear that all children would want to follow this approach."

As a research psychologist, I've learned that most problems in life can't be solved with formulas or memorized answers. Instead, they require judgment, wisdom, and creativity, which come from life experiences. Children learn these skills through play. All mammals, including humans, play when they're young, and those that have the most to learn play the most. Children need to play to develop important skills like creativity, social skills, and self-control.
Creativity is essential for success in many areas of life. We no longer need people who can only follow instructions or perform routine tasks. Instead, we need people who can think creatively and solve new problems. To develop these skills, children need to be allowed to play freely.
Many adults, including geniuses like Albert Einstein, have credited their creative work to their ability to play and think creatively. However, our education system often stifles creativity by focusing on a set curriculum and imposing strict rules.
Children are naturally social and need to play with others to develop social skills and learn to cooperate. Play is voluntary, which means that children are free to stop playing if they want to. This freedom is what makes play so democratic.
Unfortunately, our society has changed over the past few decades. Children are now expected to spend more time in school and less time playing freely. This is due to a combination of factors, including parents' fears, expert warnings, and the decline of neighborhood communities.
To ensure our children grow into strong and capable adults, we need to reverse this trend. We must give children the freedom to play and explore, allowing them to develop their natural abilities and creativity."

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to look for work. Sites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to contact potential employers directly. However, this also means there's a higher chance of making mistakes. A recent incident in the US is a good example. A young job seeker contacted a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn, hoping to get help finding a job. The executive was not impressed and sent a harsh rejection message that went viral. While the message was harsh, it highlights an important point: social media can be a dangerous tool for job hunters who don't know how to use it.
For many young people, social media is a part of their daily life. They use it to connect with friends and family, and to share their thoughts and feelings. However, using social media for professional purposes is different. It requires a more professional approach, and a different set of skills.
Some young people are struggling to make the transition from using social media for personal purposes to using it for professional purposes. They may not understand that what works on Facebook or Twitter doesn't work on LinkedIn. They may think that because their friends liked their posts, they will automatically get a job. This is not the case.
Employers are often disappointed by young job seekers who are too familiar or arrogant in their approach. This can harm their chances of getting a job. Instead, young people should focus on building relationships and offering value to potential employers. They should explain who they are, what they can offer, and how they can help.
In summary, social media can be a powerful tool for job hunting, but it requires careful handling. Young people need to understand the difference between personal and professional use of social media, and adapt their approach accordingly."

Newspapers are facing a crisis. Their circulation has been decreasing since 2000, and some experts predict that they will disappear within 15 years. However, it's worth noting that old media have a history of surviving. For example, theatre, radio, and vinyl records have all made comebacks despite the rise of new technologies.
Newspapers were once a new and innovative way to get news, but it took centuries for them to become the dominant medium. This was because producing news for a large audience over a wide area was only possible with the development of the steam press, the railway, and the telegraph.
In the past, people didn't expect to be constantly updated on current events. Life was cyclical, and people were used to dealing with unexpected events like famines, floods, and diseases. Journalism as a profession didn't exist until the 19th century, and there was no need for regular news updates.
Now, with the internet, people can access news whenever and wherever they want. They can personalize their news feed and get updates in real-time. This has changed the way we consume news, and newspapers need to adapt to this new reality.
However, instead of focusing on spreading understanding and enlightenment, many news providers are more concerned with being the first to break a story, getting lots of comments, and creating a sense of excitement. This is similar to the way news was spread in the past, where truth was mixed with rumors and misunderstandings.
Newspapers have never been very good at explaining how the world works, and perhaps they are facing extinction. Or maybe, as we live in a chaotic world, they will discover that they can still guide us to wisdom and understanding.

If humans were meant to live in the dark, we would feel comfortable in the night, just like many nocturnal animals do. But we're diurnal creatures, with eyes adapted to sunlight. This is deeply ingrained in our biology, even though we don't often think about it. Instead, we've created artificial light to fill the night, just like we would control a river. However, this has consequences, known as light pollution, which scientists are only now studying.
Light pollution is mainly caused by poorly designed lighting that shines upwards and outwards, rather than downwards where it's needed. This washes out the natural darkness, disrupting the natural rhythms of many living things, including ourselves. Wherever artificial light enters the natural world, it affects aspects of life, such as migration, reproduction, and feeding.
In the past, the idea of light pollution wouldn't have made sense. Imagine walking through a moonlit London around 1800, when it was the most populous city. The only light came from candles, torches, and lanterns. You would have smelled the city more than seen it. We've lit up the night as if it were an empty space, when in fact it's home to many nocturnal species.
Light is a powerful force that attracts many species. Scientists have observed birds being drawn to searchlights and gas flares, circling until they drop. Migrating birds often collide with brightly lit buildings, and some birds sing at unusual hours in the presence of artificial light.
It's not just astronomers who are affected by light pollution. We all need darkness to maintain our biological well-being. Denying darkness is futile, as it's essential for our health, just like light is. The regular cycle of day and night is crucial for our bodies, and disrupting it can cause physical problems.
In the end, humans are trapped by light pollution, just like the frogs near a brightly lit highway. We've cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage, losing sight of our place in the universe. Light pollution makes us forget the scale of our existence, which is best measured against the vastness of a dark night with the Milky Way above."

Here is a simplified version of the passage for a B2 learner:
The founder of a big company recently announced that they will no longer track how much holiday time their employees take. This decision was inspired by a similar policy at another company. The founder says that this idea came to him through an email from his daughter, who is a bit too perfect and well-written to be genuine. Putting aside the way the announcement was made, we need to ask if this policy is practical. The two companies are very different - one has 2,000 employees and does one thing, while the other has 50,000 employees and does many different things. The idea of 'take as much time off as you want as long as it doesn't harm the business' might work for a smaller company where everyone knows each other's workloads, but it won't work for a big company like this one.
The founder says that employees can take as much leave as they want as long as they are sure it won't hurt the business or their careers. But can anyone really be sure? Even if you prepare everything before you go, there will always be a lot of work to come back to. This is just the nature of taking time off. You put your work on hold, but it will always come back. If someone follows these guidelines, they might not take any holidays at all, or they might feel guilty about taking them. This could lead to stress and a decrease in productivity in the long run.
There are other problems with this policy too. Colleagues might pressure each other about who is taking time off and for how long. This already happens when people decide when to start and end their workday. In the corporate world, there is a culture of working late, and this could lead to a 'no holiday' culture. People might feel they can't take time off because they don't want to be seen as lazy. They might also feel safe taking time off because they have a legal right to it. If this policy is implemented, it might lead to people not taking their entitled leave or using their statutory rights as a guide, making the policy useless.
Modern technology has blurred the line between work and leisure time. The company that started this policy did it because their employees asked how to reconcile their new way of working with their old holiday policy. But this policy has a problem - all hours are now potentially working hours. Employees can't be sure if their employer is monitoring their hours, which can lead to self-discipline and stress. Employment law exists for a reason - to protect workers' well-being. Workers need rest and leisure time to be healthy. The increased morale, creativity, and productivity that are supposed to come from this policy can happen without considering worker well-being. I'm not convinced that this policy is the best way to achieve these results."

Peer review, the process of checking a scientific research paper by experts in the same field, is considered the gold standard for ensuring the quality of research. It's often presented as a crucial filter that prevents flawed or nonsensical papers from being published. However, the process can take up to a year, which raises the question: is it worth the wait? The answer is not a simple yes or no. The state of scientific publishing is changing, and I'm not ready to give up on peer review just yet. But I do think we need to adapt and find a better way.
One potential solution is preprints, which are draft papers posted online before they're peer-reviewed. This allows researchers to share their findings quickly and get feedback from others. Preprints can help shift the focus back to the research itself, rather than where it's published. Unfortunately, many scientists are hesitant to adopt this approach, partly because they worry that journals won't accept papers that have been posted online beforehand. Some people also fear that without peer review, the floodgates will open to ""junk science"". However, preprints are open to critique and discussion by the global scientific community, which can be more effective than anonymous peer review.
A psychology professor, Tanya Elks, shares her experience: ""We posted a preprint of our paper, which was a critique of another published paper. This way, the original authors could respond and we could take their comments into account. All the feedback is public, so readers can evaluate the arguments. If the journal rejects our paper, we still have the preprint and comments online, so our work isn't wasted.""
Preprints can also help with negative results, which are often overlooked in favor of new discoveries. By using the web's culture of openness and accessibility, preprints can refocus attention on the research itself, rather than where it's published."

Here is a simplified version of the text, making it suitable for a B2 learner:
When I ask my literature students what a poem is, I often get answers like 'a painting in words.' But these answers don't satisfy me or them. One day, I asked my students to choose an object and write a paragraph describing it in a scientific way, and another paragraph from the object's point of view. One student chose an oxygen mask. This exercise helped us understand how poetry works in a unique way.
When I was at school, poetry seemed confusing to me. I saw every poem as a puzzle that got in the way of understanding and feeling. After school, poetry becomes less interesting for most people. Sometimes, a poem stands out because it's different from regular writing. It's like a challenge, and you might feel disappointed or confused. But you still appreciate the effort.
What do we hope to find in poems? Don't we look for deep feelings, beautiful images, and thoughtful reflections? But if we need to cry, we watch a movie. If we want information or a critique, we read an article. Novels take us to new worlds, paintings are beautiful, and music is amazing. However, poetry has one special quality: it can be ambiguous. Our daily lives are full of ambiguity, but poetry can capture this.
The definition of a poem is often described as a form of literary art that uses language in a special way. But the word 'poem' comes from the Greek word 'poí?ma', which means 'thing made'. So, what kind of thing is a poem? Poets often compare poems to wild animals or machines, but these comparisons don't really work. The most important thing is to think about what a poem is and how it makes us see things differently.
Poems can be like song lyrics that get stuck in our heads. The combination of words and music is powerful. A poem on a page can have a big impact, even if it's just words on paper. A poem is a product of writing and rewriting, but it's not like other types of writing. It's not created to sell something; it's created for its own sake. Because of this, a poem can still surprise us, even if only for a moment."
