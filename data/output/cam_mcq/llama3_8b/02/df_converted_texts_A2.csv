Here is a simplified version of the text for an A2 level learner:

Some time ago, a website warned people about sharing their whereabouts online. The website said that when you share where you are, you are also telling everyone else, including people you might not want to meet. This made people realize that there might be some downsides to sharing so much online.

We love sharing our lives on the internet. We can share photos, stories, and thoughts with people all around the world. But sometimes we forget that what we share online can affect our real lives. We might say things online that we wouldn't say in person, and this can get us into trouble.

A long time ago, some brave people started sharing their lives online. They were called bloggers. They shared their thoughts, photos, and stories with the world. Some of them got famous, but some also got into trouble.

One blogger, Justin Hall, shared his life online from 1994. He shared his thoughts, photos, and art. People loved reading about his life, but he also got into trouble. He fell in love and shared it online, but his partner didn't like it. He had to take his blog down.

Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, shared her life online too. She wrote about her job and her life. But one day, her boss found out and she lost her job. This is called the ""online distribution effect."" It means that what we say online can affect our real lives.

Heather Armstrong learned a valuable lesson. She realized that she should be careful what she shares online. She stopped blogging for a while, but then started again and focused on her family. Now she is a famous blogger and writes about her life as a mom.

We can learn from Heather's experience. We should think carefully before sharing our lives online. We can say anything online, but that doesn't mean we should.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Some scientists were worried about a low-budget movie called What the Bleep Do We Know? The movie combines documentary and drama to show that we don't know a lot about the universe. This is true, and even scientists don't know everything. Some scientists thought the movie was too scary, but others thought it was interesting. 

At first, I didn't understand what all the fuss was about. Scientists were talking about new discoveries that show the universe is very strange. But then I saw some amazing things, like how water can change shape because of our thoughts. 

Some people think this is amazing, but scientists want more proof. They need to see more than just pretty pictures. 

Actually, there are many discoveries that show the universe is very strange. For example, scientists have found a type of matter that we don't know about, and a force that makes the universe grow. 

In other areas, scientists have found that our brains work differently than we think, and they have discovered where humans first lived and how they spread across the world. Some scientists even think that the existence of life on Earth is connected to the design of the universe. 

Despite what some people think, science is not finished. We still don't know many things, and some things are impossible to understand. This is why some scientists are trying to create a theory that explains everything. 

In summary, the universe is very amazing, and we still have a lot to learn.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a level A2 learner:

I like writing novels, but I love writing short stories. Writing a novel is like planting a big forest, while writing a short story is like planting a small garden. Both are important and help me become a better writer. When I finish a novel, I like to write some short stories. When I finish a few short stories, I feel like writing a novel again. I never write short stories while I'm writing a novel, and I never write a novel while I'm writing short stories. This helps me switch between the two and keeps my writing fresh.

I started writing short stories in 1984. It was a new experience for me, but I enjoyed it. I felt like I could explore new ideas and worlds. My readers liked this new side of me as a writer. One of my first short stories was included in a collection of stories. I liked that short stories are quick to write. It usually takes me a week to finish one. This is different from writing a novel, which can take months or years. Writing short stories is like taking a break from writing a novel. I can write about small things, like an idea or a picture in my mind. Sometimes it's like improvising music, and the story takes shape on its own. If a short story doesn't work out, I don't worry about it. I know that even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write perfect stories. I can learn from my mistakes and use them to improve my next story.

Writing short stories helps me when I write novels. It's like an experiment, and I can try new things without worrying about making mistakes. Without short stories, writing novels would be even harder for me. My short stories are like small footprints I leave behind. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt when I did. Short stories are like a way for me to share my feelings with my readers, and it makes me happy.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the passage, written at the A2 level:

Science is a way of understanding the world. It helps us cure diseases and makes our lives easier. But it also has its limits. Sometimes it's hard to understand very small things, like atoms, or very big things, like the universe. Scientists have different ideas and sometimes disagree with each other. They come from different backgrounds and have different personalities. Some scientists are very good at explaining things, while others are not. 

Over time, scientists have changed their ideas about the world. They used to think the universe was like a big clock, but now we know it's more complicated. Some people think science can't explain everything, but scientists keep trying. They make new discoveries and improve our understanding of the world. 

In the past, scientists thought they knew everything, but then they discovered new things like radioactivity and quantum mechanics. Today, scientists are still making new discoveries. 

Science is important because it helps us control nature and make decisions about our future. We need to understand science to make good choices for our children and the planet.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

For a long time, book sales were growing. But from around 2015, big publishers started to say that ebook sales were not growing as much as they used to. Some even said they were falling. This made people wonder if ebooks would eventually replace printed books. One person in the book industry said that ebooks might have caused some companies to make bad decisions and lose confidence in the importance of books.

Many people still think that ebooks will replace printed books, but the truth is that both can coexist. We still use both ebooks and printed books. This idea of ebooks replacing printed books is not new. In the past, people thought that new technologies would replace old ones. For example, when television came out, some people thought radio would disappear. But radio didn't disappear; people just started listening to it in different ways.

We also worry about the future of books because we become attached to the things we use every day. We get used to using books, computers, and other things, and we feel sad when they change. That's why we often look back to the past and miss the things we used to have. This happens with many things, like cars, music, and photography.

Some people are worried that ebooks will replace printed books, but this is not true. We can still use both ebooks and printed books. The idea of ebooks replacing printed books is just a way for us to understand and talk about change. We use this idea to think about how technology changes our lives and how we feel about it.

Note: I made some changes to the original text to make it easier to understand for an A2 learner, while keeping the main ideas and content intact. I used simpler vocabulary, shorter sentences, and removed some complex phrases and sentences.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A2 learner:

I used to wake up every weekday morning at 5:30, brush my teeth, make some coffee, and write about how famous people in the past made time for their work. I wanted to show that even great minds have daily routines and habits that help them be creative and productive. I looked at what they ate, when they slept, and how they worked. This book is about how they did their daily tasks, not just their final work. It's also about my own struggles with balancing work and personal life.

I asked myself questions like: How do you do good work and still earn a living? Should you focus on one thing or do many small things each day? And when you have too much to do, what should you give up? I don't have all the answers, but I found examples of how other successful people handled these challenges.

The book's title is ""Daily Rituals,"" but I really wanted to write about people's daily routines. A routine can be good or bad, but a good one can help you make the most of your time, willpower, and optimism. Even a famous psychologist who wrote about habits struggled with procrastination himself!

I was supposed to write a story one Sunday, but instead, I spent the day tidying up and making coffee. Then I started looking at how other writers worked and had the idea for this book. I collected stories about their routines and wrote this book. I tried to keep it short and interesting, and I used quotes from their letters, diaries, and interviews. I also used information from other people's research. I hope you enjoy the book!<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Howard became a palaeontologist because of a change in his family's plans when he was six years old. His father had to cancel their holiday to Spain because of high interest rates. Instead, they went to the English coast and Howard found an ammonite on the beach. He knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist and studied it in university. He became interested in the early days of life on Earth, not the dinosaurs. He finished his studies and was unsure if he would get a job. He applied for a job at Tavistock College in London, but wasn't sure if he would get it. The professor who was supposed to interview him had an argument with his wife and didn't show up. Another professor replaced him, and Howard got the job. He was surprised but happy to have it.

Months later, a colleague told him that the other professor had helped him get the job because he didn't like his enemy. Howard was a bit disappointed but happy to have the job. He liked his work and could support himself. He often thought about how his personal life was different from his work. In his work, he could plan and do things, but in his personal life, things could happen unexpectedly. One day, his briefcase was stolen, and he had to cancel a lecture. He went to the police and reported the theft. Later, he met a colleague who told him about a new collection of fossils at the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard was very interested and decided to go there to study the fossils. He cancelled his other plans and saved up money to go to Nairobi.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Charles Spence is a professor who studies how our senses work together to help us enjoy food. He and his team at Oxford University have found out many interesting things about how we eat. For example, did you know that the person who orders first in a restaurant usually likes their food the most? They also found out that we eat more when we're with other people.

Professor Spence's research helps food companies make better food and drinks. He works with big companies and restaurants to make sure their food tastes good. He also helps them make changes to make their food healthier.

Professor Spence has worked with famous chefs, like Heston Blumenthal, to create new and interesting dishes. He has also found out that the sounds we hear can affect how food tastes. For example, high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter, and low-pitched music makes it taste bitter.

At home, Professor Spence likes to have fun with his family. They have dinner parties and try new foods and drinks. They even play with special lights and sounds to see how it affects their taste. Professor Spence's work is all about making food and eating more enjoyable and fun.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, written for a learner of English at the A2 level:

Our brains are very busy. We have a lot of information coming at us, and we have to sort out what's important and what's not. At the same time, we're doing more things on our own. We used to rely on travel agents and salespeople to help us, but now we do everything ourselves. We're like superheroes, doing many tasks at once, but our brains aren't really good at this. We think we're doing many things at the same time, but actually, we're just switching between tasks quickly.

Dr. Earl Miller, a scientist, says that our brains aren't good at multitasking. When we think we're doing many things, we're actually switching between tasks quickly. This can be stressful and make us less efficient. Multitasking can also make us feel like we're getting a lot done, but we're actually getting less done.

Our brains have a hard time focusing because we're always looking for new and exciting things. This can make it hard to stay focused on one task. Even worse, multitasking can make us feel like we're getting a lot done, but we're actually making mistakes and getting less done.

Some scientists think that this is because our brains are not good at multitasking. They call it ""info-mania."" When we're trying to focus on one task, but we have emails and messages distracting us, it can reduce our intelligence. It's like our brains are getting tired.

In the end, we need to be careful about how we use our brains. We need to focus on one task at a time and not get distracted by too many things.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text:

In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino liked to break up concrete and throw it at visitors during the day. Was he being naughty? In caves in the US, female bats help other bats who can't have their babies. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought animals just did things without thinking. But now, scientists are studying animals and finding out that they might have feelings and morals. This has started a big debate: can animals think and feel like humans do? 

Some scientists think animals can feel pleasure and pain, like humans do. For example, cows that opened a locked gate to get food seemed happy and jumped around. If cows enjoy solving problems, what does it mean for how we treat them? Some people think we should stop eating meat. Others think we should learn more about animal thinking and behavior. 

There are different opinions about this topic. Some scientists think animals might have a simpler way of thinking than humans. Others think we should stop giving human-like thoughts to animals. The problem is that it's hard to know what it's like to be an animal, like a bat or a cow. 

One scientist did an experiment with starlings, a type of bird. He found that starlings in nice cages were more willing to eat food even when it was not good. He thinks this means that being in a bad environment can make animals feel sad and pessimistic. Another scientist agrees with him, but some people might not like this idea because it makes them think about how we treat animals.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A2 level learner:

Some people think that technology is changing the way we think. They say that we are not using our brains as much as we used to because we are relying too much on technology. Adrian West, a researcher, says that we are exposed to a lot of bad information and opinions online, which can make it hard to think clearly. He also says that having too much information can be overwhelming and make it difficult to make good decisions.

Some people think that reading is important for thinking critically. Patricia Greenfield, a professor, says that reading helps us develop our imagination, reflection, and critical thinking skills. She also says that visual media, like video games and TV, can be fun, but they don't help us think as much as reading does.

However, some people think that technology can also be good for our brains. James Paul Gee, a professor, says that video games can be a good way to learn and develop our thinking skills. He says that some games, like Sim City and Civilization, can teach us how to make good decisions and think critically.

Overall, it's important to remember that technology is not all good or all bad. It's up to us to use it in a way that helps us think clearly and make good decisions.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Matthew Crawford is a writer and a motorcycle mechanic. He used to work in an office, but he didn't like it. He wrote a book about the benefits of doing manual work. His latest book is about how to deal with modern life.

Crawford noticed that advertisements appear on our phones and computers even when we're just doing simple tasks. This makes it hard for us to think and remember things. We're also getting used to avoiding conversations with strangers because we're always interrupted. We're constantly surrounded by things that try to get our attention, like video games and apps.

Crawford is worried that we're losing the ability to focus and think deeply. We're getting more used to doing things quickly and easily, but this can make us feel tired and unable to concentrate. He thinks that we need to find ways to use our judgment and pay attention to the world around us.

Crawford gives the example of a cook, an ice-hockey player, and a motorbike rider. These people have to deal with real things, like food, ice, and roads. They use their judgment and work with others to achieve their goals. This is different from using a computer or phone, where we're just following instructions.

Crawford thinks that we should find ways to use our judgment and pay attention to the world. This can help us feel more satisfied and focused. We can do this by doing things that require our full attention, like cooking or playing sports. This can also help us be more present and aware of others.

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A2 level learner:

Do you ask people what they do for a living? It's a common question. But what if someone says they're a philosopher? It's not always easy to answer. People might think you're saying you're better than others or that you know some special secrets. But that's not true. Philosophers are just people who think deeply about life.

A long time ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle said that a life of thinking is the best life. But most people don't think like that today. Instead, they associate philosophy with thinking deeply about important issues. Socrates, another Greek philosopher, said that a life without thinking is not worth living. He meant that we should think about what we do and why we do it.

Philosophers used to be interested in big questions about life, but now many of them focus on very specific topics. This makes it hard for people without a lot of knowledge about philosophy to understand what they're talking about. This is a problem because philosophy should be about helping people think about their lives and make good decisions.

I'm a philosopher, and I sometimes describe myself as an ethicist. I think about what's right and wrong. But I think there's more to philosophy than just deciding what's right or wrong. Philosophy can help us think about our daily lives and make sense of the world. It's not just about big ideas, but about how we live our lives.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Food is important to many people. Some people think about what and how we eat because it can make eating more enjoyable. However, philosophers have not talked much about food until now. When they did talk about eating, it was usually to help them understand other things, not food itself. 

One ancient Greek philosopher named Epicurus liked to eat and drink. His name is now used to name restaurants and food shops. People use his name to show that their food is good.

Food is important because it is social and cultural. We get food from our community and share it with others. We interact with food more than with any other thing we buy. This is why food is a good topic for philosophers to think about.

Some people write about food and tell others what they think about it. They are not experts because they can describe what food tastes like. Philosophers have not studied how we perceive taste before.

Food can also be beautiful, like a painting or a symphony. Some people think that food is now important in art, but it is eaten and gone, unlike other beautiful things. 

There are also important questions about what we should eat. Should we eat food that is organic, free-range, or locally grown? These questions show what we believe about food.

Finally, food can bring people together. When we cook at home, we have a special responsibility to our guests because of our relationships with them. When we cook in a restaurant, we have different responsibilities to our employer and the food.

Some people think that food can help us understand different cultures. We can learn to appreciate other cultures by trying their food and eating together. This is a way to build relationships and understand each other better.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text:

Rob Daviau, a game designer from the US, created a new type of board game called ""legacy"" games. He wanted to make games more exciting and challenging. He took an old game called Risk and made it into a legacy game. This means that players' decisions in one game affect the next game. They might even have to tear up cards or damage the board.

Daviau worked on another game called Pandemic, where players work together to save the world from diseases. He also created a game called SeaFall, where players are sailors exploring the world.

To make sure the story of the game stays good, designers have to think about all the different choices players might make. They test the games with players to see how they work out. One player, Jaime, said it takes a lot of time to test the game and fix any problems that come up.

Daviau didn't think many people would like legacy games, but he was wrong. Many players love them because they are exciting and make them feel like they are part of a big story. One player, Russell, said it's like learning a new game every time you play. Another player, Ben, said it's like watching a TV series, where you want to keep watching to see what happens next.

Daviau thinks that legacy games are a new way to make board games more interesting. He wants to see what other designers come up with. The publisher of SeaFall, Colby, thinks it's a big change in how we think about board games.

One night, a clever octopus named Inky escaped from a tank at a big aquarium in New Zealand. He slid across the floor and went down a small drain to get to the ocean. This is a fun story that many people loved to read online.

We like to imagine that animals are like us. We think they can do things like us, like opening jars or playing with toys. Octopuses are very smart, but they have bodies that are very different from ours. They have eight arms and can do many clever things, like recognizing faces and using shells for protection.

Some people think it's not good to imagine animals are like us, but Dr. Frans de Waal, a scientist who studies animals, says this is not true. He says we often forget that animals are very smart and can do many things like us. They can even think about the past and the future, feel sorry for others, and understand what others are thinking.

A long time ago, people thought animals were very smart and could even be put on trial for crimes. But then, some scientists thought that animals were just machines that reacted to things. They thought animals couldn't think or feel like humans do. This changed how people treated animals, and many animals suffered.

But now, scientists like Dr. de Waal are showing that animals are much smarter than we thought. They can do many things on their own, like remembering where they put things or finding food. We can learn from animals and understand them better.

Dr. de Waal thinks it's good that people are starting to understand animals better. He says we can learn from them and treat them with more respect. We can also learn from our own mistakes and be kinder to animals.<|eot_id|>"

Robots are becoming more important in many areas of life. They can do tasks that humans used to do, like building and working in shops. Experts think that robots will soon be used in many more areas, and this will change the way we work and live. Many people think that robots will take over jobs, but they don't think it will happen to them. However, experts say that almost all jobs will be affected by robots in the next few years.

For example, a company in Australia has made a robot that can lay bricks much faster than humans. Another company in the US has made a robot that helps keep supermarket shelves stocked and tidy. Some people think that robots will create new jobs for technicians and programmers, but others worry that humans will lose their personal touch in work.

A expert on robotics, Dr. Zhang, says that robots will become smarter and more efficient. He thinks that many companies will need to hire people to work with robots, but some jobs may be lost. He also thinks that people will need to learn new skills to work with robots.

In the future, we will see robots that can live in our homes and interact with us in new ways. This will bring new opportunities and challenges, like making sure we are safe and private. To prepare for this, we need more people to study science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM).

Many people wonder why people climb mountains. A famous climber, George Mallory, said, ""Because it's there."" This means that sometimes people climb because it's a challenge and they enjoy it. Climbing can be a fun and exciting experience.

A writer, Tejada-Flores, wrote about different types of climbing. He said that there are different rules for each type of climb. For example, climbing a small rock or climbing a big mountain are two different things.

Some people love climbing because it makes them feel free. They like the feeling of being in nature and being active. But climbing can also be scary and difficult. Sometimes climbers have to wait for bad weather to pass or deal with other challenges.

A climber, Joe Fitschen, asked a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He said that it's because it's in our nature to take risks and try new things. Climbing can be fun because it's a challenge.

Another climber, Brian Treanor, said that climbing can help people develop good qualities like courage, humility, and respect for nature. Climbing can be a way to learn these things and become a better person.

Some climbers like to climb alone and without help. They have to be very focused and determined to succeed. This can make their achievements more special.

Climbing can also be a way to relax and feel calm. It's like a kind of meditation. Some people find that climbing helps them feel peaceful and happy.

He didn't teach many students, but he liked to help a few special ones. One day, a young boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel's concerts and asked for lessons. Brendel was surprised because Kit was very good at playing the piano. He played many songs from memory and did it very well. Brendel was impressed and decided to teach Kit.

Kit is a hard worker and always wants to learn more. He likes to learn new languages, play tennis, and write computer code. He also composes his own music. Brendel is very happy to see Kit's progress and says he has a great memory and can play many songs by ear. He is also very good at listening to Brendel's advice and can play what he teaches him.

He had funny phrases he would say, like ""It's immaterial to me."" He was not very ambitious, but he was good at fixing things around the house.

My parents moved house only once, but my mom liked to change the furniture. She would get new chairs and tables, and sometimes even a piano. I wanted to play the piano, but my mom said I wouldn't practice. My sister had lessons instead. I liked the river more than the woods or the moors. I would go there with my imagination and pretend I was in another world.

I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it didn't seem possible. But then my dad told me about a job in the Parks Department for an apprentice gardener. He thought I might be interested.

Lawrence's family runs the farm, hotel, and cottages on the island. His wife, Jenny, helps with the farm. His son, Colin, manages the cottages. His daughter, Mary, runs the hotel with her husband, Toby. They like that their boys can play outside and sail boats in the summer.

Another expert says it's not just about making games. You need to have many skills, like being creative, technical, and able to work with others. You also need to have a good idea and be willing to learn.

It's possible to start your own game design business, but it's hard. You need to be good at making games and know how to market them. A good postgraduate course can help you learn these skills.

It's also important to have connections in the industry. This means networking with other game designers and learning from them.

Gaming is no longer just for kids. Many adults play games and use them to have fun and learn new things. There are many new ways to play games, like on smartphones and social media. The industry is growing and there are many opportunities to get involved.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

I have always loved playing football since I was a child. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me to. I have a friend who used to play with us, but his dad was very bossy. This made him stop playing and he hasn't played since. I'm glad it wasn't like that for me.

When I score a goal from far away, people say it's just luck. But I've been practicing taking shots from far away since I was a kid. You need to practice to be good at football. Even the best players in the world didn't get good without practicing.

I used to play many sports at school. I loved playing football the most. My teachers did a good job, but I didn't realize it at the time. Now I want my son to have a good education and enjoy learning. We're already reading books to him, even though he's too young to sit still.

At the beginning of my football career, our manager made sacrifices so we could play for the first team. He didn't make a big deal about it, but we knew we had to work hard. We lost our first game, and a famous TV presenter said we couldn't win with young players. This made us realize how much we had to work. I have doubts sometimes, but I have faith in my team.

I rely on my close friends and family. Sometimes, having a lot of money can cause problems. Some people say I should help my parents financially, but I think they're strong individuals and don't need my help. I like to use my money to make things easier for the people around me.

After I stop playing football, I want to take a year off and do things I haven't had time for before. I want to go skiing, but I can't do that now because I might get hurt and not be able to play football again.<|eot_id|>"

The beach was empty in the summer because of fog, but now it's full of people. My father works hard to write a script and I like to sit on the beach with my dog Rusty. Rusty is a friendly dog who likes to dig and swim. One day, my father went to Los Angeles to deliver the script and Rusty and I stayed at the beach. We saw some surfers and one girl caught my eye. She was very good at surfing. She asked me to join them, but I said I don't have a surfboard. She said I could buy one, but I don't have money. She asked where I'm from and I said I live here. She asked if my father is American and I said no. He came here to write a book. She knew the book, ""Tall as the Morning"", and was interested in talking to me.

Violet Hetherington was waiting in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She was going on a cruise and was worried about being late. Her friend Annie had told her to get there late, but Violet arrived early. Now she was stuck in a long line and the computer system was broken. The other passengers were getting angry and frustrated.

Violet was feeling anxious and unhappy. She had paid a lot of money for the cruise and wanted it to be a nice holiday. But now she was worried that something was wrong. She realized that she had left her phone in the taxi and couldn't call her son to ask him to check if it was there.

A nice couple behind her in the line offered to let her use their phone to call her son. Violet was relieved and grateful. She asked her son to call their neighbor to see if the phone was at their house. Violet was worried about being without her phone in New York, but she didn't want to tell her son about it.

Finally, the line started moving and Violet got to the front. She gave her papers to the staff and went on board the ship. The ship was very fancy, but Violet was not impressed.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for an A2 level learner:

John Maloof bought a box of old photos at an auction. He didn't know what he was getting. He wanted to use the photos in a book about a neighborhood in Chicago. Instead, he found 30,000 photos taken by a street photographer named Vivian Maier. Maloof has been studying Maier's life and work. He has many of her cameras, films, and photos at his home. He is excited because he thinks he has something special.

Maier was a nanny in Chicago. She liked to take photos of people and the city. She was a bit shy, but she loved taking pictures. She wore big coats and hats and took her camera with her everywhere. People who knew her said she was a private person, but she was also very passionate about art and politics.

Maier's photos are very special because she took them just for fun. She didn't take them to sell or make money. Her photos show women, children, old people, and the city. They are very interesting and show a lot of character. Maloof thinks Maier's work is very important and wants to share it with the world. He wants to put her name in the history books.

Eleanor Catton is a young author who wrote a very long book called The Luminaries. People think it's a big success. I met her in the UK when she was very busy because of the book. She's from New Zealand, but was visiting Germany at the time. She told me a funny story about being stopped at the airport and asked to prove she's a writer. She showed the official her book and said it's about a mystery in the 1860s in New Zealand. The story is very complicated because it's about 12 men who try to solve a crime. Eleanor said she wanted to write a simple mystery, but the past made it harder for her characters. The book is very long, over 800 pages, because she wanted to give each character a big part.

When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she said it's nice because people in New Zealand feel proud of her too. She also said it's annoying when people think she's not trying to do something important with her book. Eleanor wanted to write a special kind of book with a special structure. She wanted it to be like a spiral, with each part getting shorter. She said she didn't plan it all out beforehand, but just wrote and saw what happened.

I asked her if it matters if readers notice the special structure, and she said it's okay if they don't, but if they do, they can find the patterns in the book. Despite being a complicated book, it's still an exciting mystery. Eleanor said she didn't plan it all out, but just wrote herself into a tricky situation and then tried to get out of it. She also wants her readers to have fun reading it.

We talked about TV shows, and I asked if she would like to write for TV. She said it could be cool. She loves talking about her writing and New Zealand. She said that being in a new place can change her imagination. For now, she will stay in New Zealand, which she loves.<|eot_id|>"

Jonny Kinkead has been making guitars for over 40 years. When he was a boy, he loved playing the guitar and building things with his dad's tools. He still loves guitars today. Jonny learned to play his brother's guitar when he was 11. He then wanted to learn the bass guitar. Instead of buying one, he decided to make his own. He studied guitars and figured out how different woods and shapes affect the sound.

Jonny's first guitar was a bass. He had been building things with his brothers and learned how to use tools from his dad. He even fixed instruments for his friends. After finishing school, Jonny went to university to study architecture. But he didn't like it and dropped out. He realized that building guitars was like sculpture, but it was something people could use. So, he started making guitars for a living.

At first, Jonny sold his guitars for the cost of the materials. But as he became famous for making good guitars, he could charge more. Even now, Jonny only makes about 10 guitars a year. He has to work hard to get his guitars known. He goes to music festivals and lets musicians try out his guitars. He also had to learn how to price his instruments.

Jonny thinks it's easier for new guitar-makers today. People now know that UK-made guitars are good quality. He says that taking a course can help, but you also need to try different things and learn from your mistakes.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A2 learner:

Talking about the weather is a common thing to do when speaking English. Many people think that English people love talking about the weather because it's interesting. But, in reality, talking about the weather is not really about the weather at all. It's a way for English people to start conversations and be friendly with each other.

A long time ago, a famous writer named Dr. Johnson said that when two English people meet, they usually talk about the weather first. This is still true today. Some people try to figure out why English people like talking about the weather so much. One American writer, Bill Bryson, thinks that the weather in England is not very exciting. Another writer, Jeremy Paxman, disagrees and says that the weather is interesting because it's always changing.

But, I think they're both missing the point. Talking about the weather is not about the weather itself, but about being friendly and polite. When we say ""Nice day, isn't it?"" or ""It's cold today, isn't it?"", we're not really talking about the weather. We're just being nice and trying to start a conversation.

English people use weather talk in certain situations. We use it as a greeting, to break the ice and start a conversation, or to fill a silence when we don't know what else to say. This is why people from other countries might think that English people talk about the weather all the time. But, really, it's just a way for us to be friendly and talk to each other.<|eot_id|>"

Alice Leader was a teacher who loved her job. She taught 12- and 13-year-old students about history and English. One day, she took them to see the old Roman wall in Britain. The students were very interested in the wall, but they wanted to know why it was built. Alice couldn't find a good book to help them understand, so she decided to write one herself. She had always loved teaching and wanted to keep in touch with children through her writing.

After teaching for 31 years, Alice started writing books for children. She wanted to write stories that were not too dark or too fantastical. She wanted to write about real people and their lives. Alice loved teaching because it was like acting, but writing was new and exciting for her. She enjoyed the process, even though it was sometimes scary.

Alice's husband, Zachary, was a good editor. He helped her make her writing better. He would read her chapters and suggest changes to make the story flow better. Alice was grateful for his help. She said that her husband and she worked well together because they were different. She was good at coming up with ideas, and he was good at making them work.

Alice wrote her first book because she wanted to fill a gap in children's fiction. She wanted to write stories that were interesting and easy to understand. She loved teaching and writing because it allowed her to connect with children and help them learn.<|eot_id|>"

Playing on Centre Court at Wimbledon is special. The grass is soft and quiet. When you hit the ball, you hear the echo of your own shot. The grass, the history, and the players all make you feel like you're in a special world. The quiet helps me focus on my game. 

I try to forget everything else and just think about the match. But when I win a point, I hear the applause and cheers. It's like they're far away. I don't think about all the people watching me from around the world. I'm so focused on the game.

I've always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My coach, my uncle Toni, told me it's the biggest tournament. When I was 14, I told my friends that I would play and win one day. I played and lost to Federer in 2006 and 2007. The loss in 2007 was very hard for me. I was sad and cried for a long time. I knew I could have done better, but my head wasn't strong.

My coach, Toni, told me not to cry and that there would be other chances. He was right. I got another chance in 2008. I was more confident this time. I knew I had learned from my mistakes. I was sure I would win. 

The night before the final, we didn't talk about the match at dinner. I was already thinking about the game in my head. From now on, I needed to focus and not think about anything else.<|eot_id|>"

Jane Goodall is a famous English woman who has spent most of her life in Africa. She is a scientist, journalist, and environmentalist. In 1957, she wrote to her family that she had found the Africa she had always dreamed of. She spent many years studying chimpanzees in Africa and became very famous for her work.

Jane Goodall is known for her research on chimpanzees. Before she started her work, people didn't know much about chimpanzees. They didn't know that they ate meat, used tools, or had emotions like humans. Jane's research showed that chimpanzees are similar to humans in many ways.

Jane Goodall's work is very important. She helped us understand that animals are not just different from humans, but also similar. She also helped us understand that animals have their own cultures and traditions. Her book, The Chimpanzees of Gombe, is a very important book about her research.

Jane Goodall was always interested in animals. When she was a little girl, she would often watch animals and try to learn about them. When she was five years old, she even crawled into a henhouse to find out how hens lay eggs! This shows that she was always curious about the natural world.

Note: I simplified the text by:

* Using shorter sentences and simpler vocabulary
* Removing complex scientific terms and concepts
* Focusing on the main ideas and achievements of Jane Goodall
* Adding more concrete and relatable examples to help the reader understand her work
* Removing unnecessary details and anecdotes

Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist. She can do many voices, like a child, a tired mother, and even a fast-talking alien. She has worked on many projects, including cartoons, educational videos, and commercials.

Shirley started acting when she was a student. She did some voiceovers for TV ads and cartoons. She found that she was good at it and enjoyed it. She learned to make her voices sound different and to bring the script to life.

Many actors think they can do funny voices, but Shirley says it's more than just making funny sounds. You have to make the audience believe you're the character. Shirley has worked with many famous actors who wanted to do voiceovers, but they didn't get the parts because they were used to acting with their bodies.

Shirley has had many different roles, including playing a rabbit in a cartoon. She realized she could do voices and that voiceover work might be the right career for her. She has learned to create different sounds from the back of her throat and to collect new voices by watching children's TV.

Shirley's job is not easy. There is a lot of competition, and she has to work hard to get the parts she wants. She recommends attending special workshops to learn more about voiceovers and to practice, practice, practice. Shirley loves her job and is passionate about voices. She even talks like the characters she is playing sometimes!

Many people ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a job that some people dream of as children, like being a race car driver. But most people give up on these dreams and choose more realistic jobs, like being a lawyer or working in a factory. It seems silly to think that you can make a living by drawing simple pictures, but some people do it. I've always loved drawing and was good at it. I studied graphic design in college and then showed my work to different companies. One day, a newspaper asked me to draw some cartoons about local issues. I was lucky and started selling my work. To become a cartoonist, you don't need a special degree or a lot of money. You just need to have a good idea and be able to draw. But it's not easy. You need to be very good at your job and also know how to sell your work. I've done many different types of cartoons, like political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also been a writer and a designer. It's important to be smart, read a lot, and be curious about the world around you.

Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and getting rid of some old things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. I don't usually get rid of old things, but I wanted to get rid of this guitar. I took it to the dump and was about to throw it away when a man came up to me and asked if I was sure I wanted to get rid of it. I said yes, but then I felt a little sad. The man wanted the guitar, so I gave it to him. I felt sad for a long time after that.

Later, I received an email from a man who restores guitars. He said he had my old guitar and wanted to sell it back to me. I was very happy to get it back. I had forgotten that my dad always put his name and address on things I owned, including my guitar.

I had tried to learn classical guitar when I was young, but it was hard for me. I switched to electric guitar and played simple music. When I got my old guitar back, I remembered my birthday and the day my parents gave it to me. It felt smooth and small, and my fingers knew what to do. I wanted to play it again. The electric guitar is not usually played alone, so I might start a band with my son, who plays the saxophone.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

There's been a lot of talk about sleep lately. When I wrote a book about people who can't sleep, I felt like I was warning people about the dangers of not sleeping enough. Sleep is very important for our minds, bodies, and moods. People who have trouble sleeping know how important it is.

But what about dreams? We're not talking about dreams as much. When we wake up early, we cut off the last hour or two of sleep. This is the stage where we have our most vivid and memorable dreams. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in this stage. When researchers take away this stage, people have more and more of it the next night.

Dreams are important. Some people think they help us understand our minds. Others think they help us be creative. A study found that people who work in creative jobs, like actors, writers, and directors, have a better memory of their dreams. This makes sense because film is like a dream.

But dreams are not just for artists. We all need to think creatively. Dreams help us make new connections between things we know and find new ideas. For example, if someone is woken up from a dream and asked what comes to mind when they hear a certain word, they might come up with something new and original. This is what creativity is.

I write better when I wake up from a dream. Even if the dream was scary or hard to remember, it helps me think clearly. We all need our brains to work well. We need to think creatively and flexibly to deal with our daily lives. That's why we need to dream.<|eot_id|>"

Susie is a famous artist who can copy paintings by famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that people think they are the real thing! 

Susie has been doing this for 30 years and is very good at it. She doesn't keep her copies for herself; she sells them to galleries and collectors. Some people buy her copies because they love art, and some because they want to show off. 

Susie knows that some people try to pass off her copies as the real thing, but she doesn't do that. She signs her name on the back of the canvas so everyone knows it's a copy. 

Susie used to work as an illustrator for a botanical garden, drawing plants and flowers. She was very good at it and learned to be very accurate. She now uses these skills to copy famous paintings. 

When young artists come to her for advice, she tells them to learn to draw well and to be accurate. She also says that copying famous paintings is very hard, but she has spent many years practicing. 

Susie loves copying paintings by French artists like Monet, Manet, and Degas. She thinks that people think it's easy to copy modern art, but it's actually very hard. She is very good at what she does and makes a good living from it.

Jordan's goal is not just to climb Everest, but also to climb the highest mountains on every continent. This is a big challenge, and few people have done it before.

Some experienced climbers think it's not a good idea to take a 13-year-old up the mountain. They worry that Jordan might not be strong enough or experienced enough. But Jordan's parents are experienced climbers too, and they think they can help him.

I asked Jordan why he wants to climb the mountain. He said he just wants to achieve his goal. His father, Paul, said they talk to Jordan regularly to make sure he still wants to do it. Paul also said that if Jordan loses interest, they will stop the project and do something else.

It's true that many people today want to achieve records and be famous. Jordan has to be careful not to lose sight of why he started climbing in the first place. But if he can climb Everest, it will be a big achievement, and he might inspire others to be more active too.<|eot_id|>"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, you can be sure it's not classical music they're listening to. Most people know many pop group names, but ask friends if they know who Brahms was, and they might look confused. I'm studying music, but my friends don't know much about classical music. If you don't know who wrote the music, you won't buy their records. The numbers are not good for classical music lovers. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical record sells only 300 copies. I think it's strange.

Why don't teenagers like classical music? First, classical music is slow and has many changes in mood, which can be hard to follow. We like to talk and think fast. Also, classical music needs attention and concentration, but we can't focus for more than three minutes. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to. Classical music is powerful, but it's not about the things that interest teenagers. We listen to music differently now. We can find any music on the internet, and classical music is not part of our daily lives.

I don't know why people like classical music more when they are older. But I know that if your parents like something, you might not want to like it too. Some people say that schools are the problem, but there are still kids who love playing classical music in their school orchestra. They practice before and after school. Classical music is special to them when they play it, but not when they're relaxing. We like different types of music for different things.

But how did he go from being a surfer to performing in front of thousands of fans? Cody started playing the guitar when he was six and writing songs when he was seven. He loved swimming and surfing more than music back then.

When he was 13, he posted some videos of himself singing online. People loved them, and he started making more videos. This changed everything. Record labels wanted to work with him, and he had to make a big decision: stay in Australia and swim, or move to the US to pursue music. He chose music.

It was hard for him to make this choice, especially at such a young age. He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was leaving. It was a big surprise to them. Cody is a quiet person and likes to keep a low profile.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

I got out of bed and looked out the window. The river was frozen, but there was a small crack in the ice. I could see the wall of sandbags along the riverbank, which we built to protect the town from flooding when the ice melts. I had worked hard all week with the other adults to build them. My grandfather didn't seem to care.

As I got ready for my kayaking trip, I saw a boy on the other side of the river. He was trying to stand on a thin piece of ice near the warm water from the factory. I put on my special kayaking suit and grabbed my jacket. I checked my pocket for a special chain my grandfather gave me. It's very important to me.

I went downstairs and said good morning to my mom. She was cooking breakfast. I grabbed a banana and said I was going kayaking. My grandfather came out of his room and was grumpy as usual. He asked me what I was doing and I told him I was going kayaking. He didn't seem to care.

My grandfather can be mean sometimes, but I try to ignore him. He used to be my hero when I was a kid, but now he's not as nice as he used to be. My mom tried to make me feel better and told me to have a good time kayaking. I ate my banana and went outside to the boathouse.

* Simplified vocabulary and sentence structures
* Removed complex sentences and phrases
* Reduced the amount of descriptive language
* Focused on the main ideas and events

Mum grabbed Jess's arm. 'Come with me,' she said. Jess followed her to the study. On the table, there was a painting that looked like something Grandpa had done, but it was different from his usual style. 'Do you know anything about this?' Mum asked. Jess shook her head. 'I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything.' Jess looked at the painting. There was a river in it, but it wasn't a real river. The picture was strange and beautiful in a weird way. The riverbank was very small and hard to see. The picture felt empty, like there was no room for living things. But Jess was interested. She thought about autumn coming after a long, hot summer. Mum said, 'It has a name.' There was something in her voice that made Jess wonder why she was saying it. Grandpa never gave his paintings names. Mum turned the painting over and showed Jess the words written on the back. Jess read them out loud: 'River Boy.' The words seemed important, but Jess didn't know why. Then she noticed something strange. There was no boy in the picture. 'Mum, that's weird,' she said. 'Why would he name it that?' Mum said, 'Maybe he'll add the boy later.' Jess looked at Mum. 'Why did you ask him about it?' Mum said, 'I couldn't help it. It's such an unusual picture.' Jess knew what Grandpa would say. He would say that artists don't explain their paintings because each one has its own special meaning, like a poem. And he would say that if artists had to explain their pictures to everyone, they would never finish their work. Mum said, 'I was hoping you might know something about this painting, since you're like a special helper for him.' 'Helper?' 'Someone who helps an artist.' Jess knew what that meant. Grandpa would say that sometimes his helper wasn't being kind to him, or that he had to be nice to the helper. But he never said that Jess was his helper. 'He doesn't need me to help him,' Jess said. 'He's been painting for a long time.'<|eot_id|>"

I woke up this morning and didn't mean to cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I'm not saying it was an accident, but it could have been. I was trying to fit a small cabinet into a corner of my room. My grandma gave me the cabinet, and it's really cute. It's small and white with flowers on it. I keep my collection of shells and stones in it.

My room is a bit small and shaped like a wedge of cheese. I have a small bed and a wardrobe, and that's about it. I was trying to find a way to fit the cabinet into a corner, but it was too tall. I thought about cutting a small hole in the carpet to make room for it. I thought my dad would be proud of me for thinking outside the box.

I'm not very good at finding solutions, and this is something that often happens to me. I just wanted to find a way to fit the cabinet into my room, and cutting a hole in the carpet seemed like the best idea at the time.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text:

The TV show 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live in the walls and floors of a house. They take things from the normal-sized people who live in the house to survive. When I directed the show, I knew it would be hard to make it good because people who love the book have strong ideas about how it should be. I used the original drawings from the book to help me. The author wanted the show to be from the Borrowers' point of view, not a human's. This made filming more complicated. The biggest problem was getting the size right. The Borrowers are 10 times smaller than humans, so we had to be 10 times farther away from them when filming. We also had to crawl on the ground to get the right shots. We built a special set for the Borrowers' home under the floorboards. The actors had to carry big objects to make them look small. Sometimes we had to stop filming because they made us laugh too much!

We had to be careful with the shadows when combining the Borrowers with the normal-sized surroundings. We developed a special technique for this. After the show was finished, a famous director, George Lucas, called me to ask how we did it. We built the Borrowers' home under the floorboards and filled it with big objects. The actors had to carry big things like scissors and coins. They were hard to lift, and sometimes we had to stop filming because they made us laugh. In one scene, the Borrowers get swept away by a drain. The actors said it was scary, but they didn't have to act much. I was careful with the costumes, making them look like doll clothes. The actors had trouble wearing them because they were heavy and hard to move in. The weather was hot during filming, and the actors didn't thank me for my attention to detail. We had to film most scenes in front of a blue screen, and the actors had to react to things that weren't really there. I drew pictures of each scene to help them understand what to do. It was a big job, but we did it, and I think the show was successful in bringing the magic of the books to life.<|eot_id|>"

My mom drives me to my new school, Palm Grove High. She looks around nervously and says, ""Let's see how long it takes before things get crazy."" She's worried about the reporters and paparazzi. I tell her everything will be okay and she gives me a kiss before leaving.

I'm excited to start at this new school because I want to make new friends who are not famous like my friends from my old school. I want to meet kids who have normal jobs, like a mom who works in an office or a dad who cuts grass.

When I get to the school office, I ask for my schedule. The secretary looks confused when she sees my last name, McGraw. She types it into the computer and hands me a sheet with my classes. I'm in English Literature first period, which is my favorite subject.

I study the school map the night before so I won't get lost. When I get to my English class, I slip in late and sit down next to a girl who smiles at me. She likes my shoes, but I think I should have worn something else.

The teacher, Ms. Smigla, introduces herself and gives us our course outlines. We get to talk to each other for a bit, and she asks me why I moved here. I tell her my dad had to relocate for work. She's nice and friendly, and I like her.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Being a teenager in America is very busy. Teenage girls are expected to be good students, have a part-time job, and volunteer. They also need to do well in all these things. Teenage boys and girls can't just go to school and blend in, because being average is not good enough. People often think that teenagers have too much freedom and don't work hard enough. But this is not true.

Many teenagers have a lot of work to do. They have homework, tests, and activities outside of school, and they also need to help at home. They may also want to have some time for their friends and family. Some people think that teenagers spend all their time watching TV or playing with their phones, but this is not true.

Teenagers use their phones to help them with their work and to stay in touch with their families. They can do their homework anywhere, at any time. This means they need to be available 24 hours a day. Many teenagers wake up early and go to bed late, with not enough sleep. Some teenagers don't get enough sleep and may fall asleep in school.

Some people think that teenagers are selfish and only care about themselves. But this is not true. Many teenagers want to help others and make a positive difference in their community. One teenager, Lindamarie, likes to volunteer and help others. She thinks that teenagers are often misunderstood and that they are capable of great things.

In the future, people will probably still have the wrong idea about teenagers, but teenagers will continue to prove them wrong and make a difference in the world.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A2 learner:

The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in a small town called Bishop, surrounded by mountains in the US. They have launched over 50 balloons into space over the past few years. They do this as a science project, but it's also an adventure. I joined them one weekend to see what they do.

They were about to launch a new balloon to see shooting stars. These are stars that burn up in the Earth's atmosphere and make a bright trail. The balloon has a special box attached to it with a camera, a tool to measure height, and a thermometer to measure the temperature. There are also two GPS trackers to help them find the balloon later.

The balloon gets bigger and bigger as it fills with air, and the students chant ""Five, four, three, two, one"" before it takes off. They run to follow it with flashlights and watch it disappear into the night.

After the launch, some students stay to watch for shooting stars. They lie on blankets and look at the very clear sky. It's hard to believe that they're just a few hours from a big city with millions of people.

The balloon goes up high and then pops, and a parachute helps the equipment come back down to Earth. The students will find it the next day using the GPS trackers. It's not always easy to get the equipment back, but that's part of the fun.

The group's leader said that they've lost only two boxes in 53 launches. They like to recover the equipment because it's a big part of the adventure. They have to drive or walk to find it, and it's not always easy. But for these students, it's just a normal part of life.

In the end, it took them 11 hours to find the box. It was in a canyon, high on a rock, near a waterfall. They didn't get any pictures of shooting stars, but they can talk about the science behind it. And they have another exciting story to tell.<|eot_id|>"

Chloe Morgan didn't like science when she was young. She didn't even like dinosaurs. But then she was 15 and helped her brother with a school project. She read an article about dinosaurs and it changed everything. She wanted to learn more.

Chloe met a famous paleontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was kind and patient. He encouraged her to ask questions. This made her feel more comfortable.

I ask her about movies and TV shows that feature paleontologists. She says that they often show paleontologists as weird or boring. She thinks this is not true. In real life, paleontologists do many different jobs, like digging up bones, studying fossils, and writing reports.

Chloe also talks about explaining science to the public. She thinks it's important to help people understand science and not have wrong ideas. She likes to talk to children about science and dinosaurs because it can make them excited about the natural world.

Chloe worked on a TV documentary about dinosaurs. She was happy to help because the people making the documentary were careful to get things right. She thinks dinosaurs are still interesting because they remind us that there is still much to discover. They take us on a journey back in time.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 level learner:

When you're on a car trip with your family, you know you're not there yet, even if you ask 'Are we there yet?' a lot. But when you finally get there, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here'. So, you should ask 'Are we here yet?' instead. Parents get tired of answering 'Are we there yet?' all the time. They wish they could relax and enjoy the trip. 

In the back seat, you can watch movies, listen to music, or do puzzles while looking out the window. Your parents will take care of everything, like giving you snacks and adjusting the music. But sometimes, your brother or sister might do something annoying, like putting their foot on your side of the seat. Then you might get upset and a fight might start. 

To calm things down, your parents will tell you to stay in your own seat and not touch each other. But sometimes, your brother or sister might find another way to bother you, like blowing on your arm. This can make you angry. 

To deal with this, your parents have come up with some tricks. For example, they might say 'We're there!' when you're still on the highway. This can make everyone quiet for a while. But when you finally arrive, you can tell because the grown-ups will get out of the car and go away from the kids. So, if your parents are still near, the answer to 'Are we there yet?' is 'no, we're not there yet.'<|eot_id|>"

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a special café in Oxford, UK. They serve coffee and cake, and people can also play board games there. The owners want people to have fun and come back again. Zuzi says they wanted to create a place where people can be together and talk, not just stare at their phones.

The games they play are called 'Eurogames'. They are games where people work together or compete in a friendly way. The first Eurogame was 'The Settlers of Catan'. Players build settlements and trade with each other. It's a fun game that makes everyone feel included.

Another popular Eurogame is 'Pandemic'. Players work together to solve problems and save the world. The game designer, Matt Leacock, was inspired by another game called 'Lord of the Rings'. He wanted to create a game that was fun and exciting, but not too competitive.

Many people enjoy playing games with friends and family. But with the rise of video games, some people started playing alone on their phones or computers. Now, people are looking for ways to play games with others in person. That's why John and Zuzi's café is so popular.

Playing games together is not just fun, it's also a way to connect with others and make new friends. In our busy lives, it's nice to have a place where we can be together and have fun.<|eot_id|>"

Jamie Scott is a successful music producer and songwriter. He knows that perseverance is important in the music industry. He started playing the guitar when his mother, who was a good singer, taught him. When he was a child, he only listened to music from a local radio station that played old songs. This influenced his taste in music. Jamie started playing the piano at school during lunch breaks and wrote songs. He was good at tennis, but he didn't want to play it professionally. At 17, he left school to pursue a music career. He was part of a duo with a friend, but they didn't share the same passion for performing. Jamie's parents gave him a deadline to make it in the music industry. If he didn't succeed, he would have to get a job. After some near-misses, he was signed to a music publisher at 19. However, record labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to leave his friend. Jamie realized that he was better behind the scenes rather than on stage. He wrote for other artists and found success. He believes that writing songs that are popular and sell well is not shameful. He wants to write songs that people love and that become number one hits. Jamie is honest about his goals and doesn't worry about what others think. His goal is to write the best music possible.

Tony Connor is a famous person on the internet, but not many people know who he is. He's a street trials cyclist, which means he rides a bike and does cool tricks on different objects like roofs, walls, and rocks. People record him doing these stunts and put them on the internet. I met Tony at a bike park on a Saturday morning. Many people knew who he was and came to say hello. I was surprised by his bravery, imagination, and willingness to take risks. Before he does a stunt, he explains what he's going to do, and I often think it's impossible. But he always does it! Afterward, I complimented him, but he seemed not to care. He's not happy with being famous, though he knows it's because of the internet and cameras. He likes to do things instead of talking about them. He makes a good living from his videos, which is unusual for someone who does what he does.

I've talked to many athletes, and I think there are two important things that make someone great: energy and the ability to deal with disappointment. These qualities help people keep trying even when they fail. Tony fell a few times when he was trying new things, but he got back up and kept going. Some people think he's reckless and takes too many risks, but he says they don't understand the sport and the risks are minimized with expert advice. Tony is aware of the dangers and knows how to manage his fear. He plans and prepares carefully before doing a new stunt, and he knows not to lose his nerve before trying something new.

To help her stay balanced, she carried a long stick that weighed 8 kilograms. Helen took lessons from a professional wire walker. She already knew some circus tricks, but she found that walking on a wire was very different. ""The training was tough,"" Helen said. ""I didn't know how strong I would need to be. Every day, I would run up a big hill, do some exercises, and then practice on the wire. I also learned how to fall safely onto the wire so that if I slipped, I could keep going. It hurt every time I fell, but I had to stay positive. If I was scared and started shaking, the wire would shake too!""

The day of the challenge was windy, but Helen took deep breaths and walked slowly along the wire. It took her 15 minutes to walk the 150 meters.

Many people like her course because it's fun and includes many different skills, like juggling, trapeze, and even throwing fire! On the one-year course, students learn to do more and more things, and sometimes their parents come to watch. Sophia says that to be a good circus performer, you need to keep practicing and trying new things. It's also important to be friends with other performers and learn from them. You need to be fit, just like athletes, and train every day to stay strong.

Sophia says that the best performers are those who want to improve and never stop learning. Some people think that being a circus performer is hard and you might get hurt, but Sophia says that's not the biggest problem. The biggest problem is that you can't be on the road forever, and you need to think about what you'll do when you're older.

The course also teaches students how to plan a business. Many students who finished the course started their own businesses around the world and are happy to share their experiences.

Some people think backing singers aren't good enough to be the main singer. But that's not true! Backing singers are actually very good and have to be better than the main singer. Mariam is one of these talented singers.

""What I like about my job is that I never know what I'll be asked to sing when I go to the recording studio,"" she says. ""It could be a classical song, or a funny tune for the radio or a TV commercial. Sometimes producers ask me to do something really unusual, like singing like a fish! But I don't argue, I just get on with the job.""

To be a good backing singer, you need to have good musical skills and be able to learn quickly. Sometimes there's no written music to follow, so you have to remember everything. I remember my first time recording music for a movie. It was very complicated because there were eight of us singing different tunes, and an orchestra too. I was a bit scared because if I made a mistake, we would have to record everything again. Recording sessions are long enough already!

One of my favorite jobs is helping songwriters. New writers sometimes don't know what kind of music sounds good with a female voice. By listening to me sing their song, they can figure out how to make it better.<|eot_id|>"

She put it online and it became very popular. People liked it and found new meanings in the words each time they listened. A man named Joss from a music company called Isotope Music came to ask her to join his company. Ana was hesitant at first, but Joss promised she would have freedom to write what she wanted. She performed at a concert in Dublin and it was a big success. Ana likes to write about her personal experiences, especially when things are difficult. One of her favorite songs is ""Decision"", about why her brother stopped singing and how sad it made him. Ana hopes her fans will like her songs, but she wants to write about things that matter to her.<|eot_id|>"

I went on a big trip last year. My brother Harry, who is a journalist like me, planned it. He wanted to write articles about the trip. He loves boats, but I don't. I've always wanted to visit this place because my great-grandparents used to live there. I asked Harry if I could come, and he finally said yes!

Before we left, there were big storms in the area, but the weather was supposed to be calm when we went. Harry said he took care of everything, so I didn't worry. We arrived in Canada and joined a group of people who were going on the trip. We packed our things into small boats and started our journey. The guide told us that not many people live in this area, and we only saw dolphins and birds on the first morning. We couldn't see the islands because of the fog, so we just looked at the patterns our boat made in the water.

We stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beach. They were full of colorful fish that I didn't know. It was great to not have to worry about time. We always had lunch and dinner together, making food over campfires. When we went to sleep on the boats, it felt like we were living without stress. When it was time to leave, I was sad. I didn't want to go back to my normal life. But I knew if I stayed, I would miss my family and friends. I was excited to tell them about our adventures when I got back home!<|eot_id|>"

My dad was a basketball player in Germany. His dad was a player too. I went to many of his games when I was a kid. You might think that seeing so many games would make me like basketball, but it didn't. I liked telling my friends how good my dad was, but I would rather read a book than watch the game. When I was 12, I was already 2 meters tall. My sports teacher asked if I wanted to play basketball with the school team. I was shy, but the teacher thought I was good enough. I played against another school and it was okay. For the next 4 years, I practiced every day and did well. I even played with an adult team. When I was 15, I moved to the USA to train with a special basketball team. The coach was very good and worked with Olympic players. It was hard to live far from my parents at first, but I got used to it. My English improved quickly. I became a professional basketball player at 18. I was taller than most players, but I was too light, so I had to work on that. My coach found a team for me, and I'm happy I joined them.

Seven years ago, I was studying tourism in college. I needed a part-time job because my course was expensive. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my hometown, Chicago. I took visitors around the city and enjoyed showing them the sights. After finishing my studies, I decided to make tour guiding my full-time job.

But I soon realized that being a full-time tour guide is not just about knowing some basic facts about the city. I had to learn a lot more to get a special license. I had to know about the city's history, architecture, and public transport rules. It was a challenge, but I worked hard and got my license.

As a tour guide, I need to be able to answer many questions and make sure everyone stays together. I also need to be funny and tell interesting stories. Sometimes, things don't go as planned, like if a place is closed or a route changes. I have to be able to handle these problems and make sure tourists have a good time. I want to make sure they're happy with my tour, or they might leave a bad review online. Good reviews help me get more customers, so I try to make my tours fun and stress-free. I'm proud of my good reviews and happy that people recommend my tours to others visiting Chicago.<|eot_id|>"

My name is Ella. I'm 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand with my sister Josie. We're not too far apart in age, even though she's five years younger than me. We went to help elephants at a special place where people take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I wasn't sure if we would get along with the other helpers because they were older than us. We were also a bit nervous because we had never done something like this before. But it was okay. Our main job was to collect food for the elephants. They eat a lot of grass and bananas, so it took a long time. Josie found it hard work, but it was worth it to see the elephants happy. We also washed the elephants in a river using big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even though I got wet! The best part of the day was the evening. We took the elephants to the forest at night, and all the helpers stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a room, so we didn't have much space. But it was okay because she didn't want to be alone. It was hot and humid at night, but we expected that. The food was yummy and didn't have meat, which we don't like. After dinner, we talked and played games with the other helpers and staff. Now that we're back in the UK, Josie doesn't talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks her if she liked it, she says she loved it. I'm not sure if she's telling the truth. I think she might be a bit sad that she didn't make the most of her time because she missed her friends. But she knows she was lucky to go. Maybe she'll go back one day - I definitely will!<|eot_id|>"

My name is Gina D'Costa and I run a flower shop in the UK. I sell flowers to many different people. Hotels and offices buy flowers to put in their reception areas. Sometimes I help with photo shoots for businesses. I even decorated a castle for a wedding once! It was a big job, but I was very proud of what we did.

My day starts early, at 4 a.m. I go to the flower market to buy fresh flowers. It's dark and cold, but I don't mind. The market is full of beautiful flowers from all around the world. It's hard to choose which ones to buy, but I have to think about what my customers will like.

I have to talk to the flower sellers about prices, which can be tricky. Flowers are not cheap, so I need to get the best deal possible. Back at the shop, we sort through customer orders and make vases with the flowers. Then we make bunches of flowers and figure out how much they cost. Sometimes customers are surprised by how much flowers cost, so I have to ask them to think again about what they want. I like making sure I can give customers the best flowers for their money. That's what I love about my job!<|eot_id|>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows new movies and children's films on weekends. It's close to where I live. Last year, I thought it would be fun to watch movies with friends and talk about them afterwards. So, I started a film club with two friends. We didn't want to rent a cinema, so we chose a different place in the city each month. Sometimes we even use free places, like an old factory. We show snacks and make a little money, but we don't try to make a profit. We're happy as long as we cover our costs. We've got our own equipment now, which makes things easier. We also know how many people are coming because we sell tickets online. When everyone says they had a great time, it's wonderful. We've made a website and are in touch with other film clubs. We've visited them and learned how they do things. We've also started a blog because most people look for film information online. We put up posters in cafes, but word of mouth is the best way to get people to come. We also do special activities with each film, like a movie quiz last month, which everyone enjoyed.<|eot_id|>"

I loved taking pictures when I was a child. When I was 15, I wanted to take my hobby to the next level. So, I decided to take one photo every day for a whole year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea. I put my photos on a website for young photographers. I was surprised that others liked my photos. I enjoyed taking pictures of many things, but then someone suggested that if my photos had a theme, it would be even better. So, I started taking pictures of nature, especially birds and the sky. Most of my photos were black and white, which was different from what other young photographers were doing. Sometimes I doubted my project, but I trusted my feelings and became more confident. My art teacher at school told me about a photography competition for people my age. I entered some of my photos just for fun. I was so happy when I won first prize! It was the first time I realized that my photography was good and that I could work as a professional photographer. Now, I have my own photography studio and I'm happy with my choice.

I changed the following:

* Simplified vocabulary: e.g. ""favourite activity"" instead of ""favourite hobby"", ""take my hobby to the next level"" instead of ""do something special"", ""put these photos onto a website"" instead of ""create a photo diary and show other people my photos""
* Shortened sentences: e.g. ""I decided to start a personal project: I would take one photograph every day for a whole year of my life"" became ""I decided to take one photo every day for a whole year""
* Removed complex phrases: e.g. ""I was amazed to discover that there were others who liked the way I saw and photographed things"" became ""I was surprised that others liked my photos""
* Changed sentence structure: e.g. ""I began to concentrate more on taking photos of nature scenes, especially of birds and the sky"" became ""I started taking pictures of nature, especially birds and the sky""

When I was 15, I wanted things my friends had, and I didn't think about the future. My best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I wanted one too. My parents said I could have it if I worked part-time and saved up. I learned a valuable lesson from this. I worked on Saturdays at a café, but I didn't enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own business instead. I liked making things with my mum, so I asked if I could try making necklaces. I was surprised it was easy! My friends thought it was boring, but I liked the idea. My mum showed me how to make things at home with simple tools and materials. I sold my first necklaces to my friends and family. They said they liked them, but I wasn't sure if they were good enough for others to buy. To find out, my mum and I got a market stall. Many tourists came to our town, and they bought my things to give to their friends and family. We started getting orders from all over the country. People thought we were a big company, but we were just two people on a stall! That's when I knew it could work, and I should make a website.

Hi, my name is Tom. I'm 15 years old. Three years ago, my family and I moved to a castle on a small island. My dad got a new job taking care of the castle. He's very happy because it's a great opportunity. But we were a bit worried about moving to a new place. We didn't know what it would be like. Our old home was cozy, but this castle is not as nice. There's no school on the island, so I have to go to school on the mainland every day. I take a boat to get there. Sometimes the sea is rough, and I like that.

After that, I joined a local birdwatching club for young people. My goal is to see 200 different types of birds. I've seen many birds on family holidays to other countries, too. When I go on holiday, I look for places where people go birdwatching so I can see new birds. I've been to Egypt and South America, where I tried to see my 200th bird. It didn't happen, but I learned that you have to be patient. I made a video about my challenge and many people liked it. My teachers asked me to talk about birdwatching at school. I was a bit nervous, but I did okay. I think it's lucky that I live in the countryside. Many people in cities might not think about watching birds, but there are lots of birds in green areas.

Research is an important part of learning. It's not just for famous professors or scientists. Research is a way to find out more about something and to build knowledge. It's a skill that you can use in your studies and in your job.

As a student, you can make a contribution to knowledge. You don't just learn what others have already discovered. You find out more and make new discoveries. Research is about asking questions and finding answers. You might ask ""Why?"", ""How?"", ""What does this mean?"", or ""What if...?"".

There are different types of research. Some is very complex and important, while some is more everyday and practical. You might have done research before, even if you didn't realize it. For example, you might have asked questions and found answers when you were doing a project at school or when you were fixing something at home.

In college and university, you will be expected to think critically and ask questions. You will need to explore and evaluate the information you read and hear, and make your own decisions. It's okay to question what others have said and to think about what they are saying. In fact, it's important to do this.

It's also important to be careful when using information from others. You should think about whether it's true and whether it makes sense. Don't just accept what others tell you without thinking about it.

Remember, research is a skill that you can use throughout your life. It's a way to find out more about the world and to make new discoveries.<|eot_id|>"

Cities are important places for learning and creativity. In the past, people would gather in coffee shops to talk about new ideas. Today, artists and writers still find inspiration in cities. However, city life can be stressful. The same places that inspire creativity can also spread diseases. Some people prefer to live in the countryside instead.

Scientists are studying how cities affect our brains. They found that cities can make us less smart. One reason is that cities have very little nature. Studies show that when people can see trees or nature from their windows, they recover faster from illnesses. Even just looking at nature for a short time can improve our thinking.

Most people now live in cities. Instead of living in the countryside, we are surrounded by many people and buildings. This can affect our mental and physical health. Cities can also change how we think. When we walk in a city, we have to pay attention to many things, like other people and cars. This can be tiring for our brains.

Scientists have found that our brains get tired when we have to pay attention to many things at once. This is because our brains are like supercomputers, but using them takes a lot of energy. Nature, on the other hand, is relaxing and doesn't require as much effort. This is called attention restoration theory.

Many people have known that nature is good for us for a long time. Philosophers and architects have designed parks and gardens to bring nature into cities. These parks can improve our brains in just a few minutes. Instead of trying to improve our brains with medicine or special drinks, we can just take a walk in nature.

Despite the challenges of city life, cities are still important for creativity and learning. Scientists have found that the crowded streets and many people in cities actually help create new ideas. The key is to find a balance between the benefits and challenges of city life.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A2 level learner:

Do we only think with our brains? This might seem strange: of course, our brains are where our thoughts happen. But why can't we think about the things around us too? There is a lot of evidence that shows us that objects, just like our brains, are part of our thinking. 

In the past, people used stones, jewelry, and other objects to help them think and learn. These objects helped them understand the world and solve problems. So, it's not just our brains that make us think, but also the things around us.

When we study the human mind, we usually take away the things people use every day. This makes sense if we're trying to understand how our brains work. But it means we often forget that most of our thinking happens outside of our heads. 

I'm not saying that our brains aren't important, but I think we should consider that our minds are more than just our brains. Instead, we should think about how our minds work with the things around us. This is what my theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET), is all about. 

MET looks at how we use objects to help us think and learn. For example, when we use a stick, it becomes part of our body. We use it to feel and understand the world around us. This shows us that our minds are not fixed and can change as we use new things. 

I think this is important because it means that our minds are always growing and changing. We use technology, like tools and smartphones, to help us think and learn. This is what makes us human.

Photography has changed the way we see the world. It's a very important invention that has had a big impact on American culture. Many people think it's the country's greatest contribution to the visual arts. Photography is used in many areas, such as science, industry, art, and entertainment. It's a way to capture moments and memories, and it's been very popular in the United States.

People liked photography because it was a new and exciting technology. It was a way to show the world and bring it closer to people's homes. Photography is also a way to show who we are and how we look. It's a way to present ourselves to others. Many people use photography to remember special moments and events with their families.

Photographs are special because they are real and show what really happened. They can also show what the photographer wanted us to see. But, photographs can have different meanings depending on the context. For example, a photograph can mean one thing in a newspaper and something else in a gallery.

Photography has become an important part of art. Many artists use photographs in their work. This is not new; it started many years ago with an artist named Andy Warhol. Today, many artists use photographs in their work, and it's an important part of the way we represent the world.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A2 learner:

Psychology is the study of our minds and thoughts. It's a big topic, and we all have our own thoughts and feelings. Even animals like rats and monkeys have thoughts and feelings, too. William James, an important psychologist, defined psychology as the'science of mental life'. This means that psychology is about understanding how we think, feel, and behave.

Psychologists study the human mind and brain, but it's hard to understand how they work. They can't directly see what's going on in our brains, so they have to observe how we behave and make guesses about what's happening inside our minds. This is like trying to solve a puzzle. They look at clues, like how we behave, and try to figure out what's going on.

Psychology is important because it helps us understand ourselves and others better. It can help us learn new things, like how to teach children to read or how to make machines safer. It can also help people who are sad or upset by helping them talk about their feelings.

In the past, psychologists used to try to understand the mind by thinking about their own thoughts and feelings. But this wasn't very helpful. Now, psychologists prefer to study how other people behave and make guesses about what's going on in their minds. This way, they can learn more about the human mind and how it works.<|eot_id|>"

In a special storehouse in Michigan, USA, there is a collection of products that didn't sell well. It's called the Museum of Failed Products. The museum has many strange and unusual products, like yogurt shampoo and cola for breakfast. The owner, Carol Sherry, thinks that each product has its own sad story about why it didn't sell.

What's surprising is that this museum exists and makes money. Many companies don't keep samples of their failed products. The museum was started by a man named Robert McMath, who wanted to collect all new products. He didn't think about how many of them would fail. Most products don't sell well.

People might think that companies would learn from their mistakes and not make the same ones again. But often, they don't talk about their failures. They might even keep spending money on a product that's not selling well because they don't want to admit it's a failure.

This idea of not talking about failure is also true in the world of self-help. Some people think that if you imagine something going well, it will happen. But research shows that thinking about the future can actually make people less motivated to work towards their goals. 

Some psychologists think that our experiences of failure are influenced by how we think about ability. Some people believe that ability is fixed and can't be changed. Others think that ability can be developed through hard work and practice. People who think ability is fixed are often very upset when they fail because it means they're not good enough. People who think ability can be developed see failure as a sign that they're pushing themselves to learn and get better.

This way of thinking about failure is a happier and more helpful way to be, whether or not it leads to success.<|eot_id|>"

Do sports teams really do better when they play at home? Many people think so, but some scientists and experts are not so sure. They want to know why this is the case. Some think it's because the players feel more comfortable at home, while others believe it's because the fans cheer them on.

But what if a team plays some of its home games in a different country? Would it still be an advantage? Some people think it wouldn't matter, as long as the players are paid well. Others believe that fans are important because they give the team energy and motivation.

Scientists have done some research on this topic. They found that referees are more likely to make decisions in favor of the home team when they hear the crowd cheering. This might be because referees don't want to upset the crowd.

Some experts have also looked at how home advantage has changed over time. They found that it's not as big an advantage as it used to be. This might be because players travel more easily now and have better living conditions.

But despite all these changes, home advantage is still important in some sports, like basketball and football. In other sports, like baseball, it's not as big a deal. One reason for this might be that baseball is a more individual sport, where players don't work together as much.

Another theory is that home advantage is connected to a feeling of territoriality. Players might feel more motivated to win when they're playing at home because they want to defend their ""turf"". This is like a strong instinct to protect their home and territory.

Overall, there are many different reasons why home advantage might be important in sports. But it's not always easy to understand, and there's still much to be learned about this topic.<|eot_id|>"

Gary Player, a famous golfer, once said, ""The more I practice, the luckier I get."" But what does this mean? Some people think he meant that the more you practice, the better you get. This idea is important in sports and other areas of life. Some people think that if you practice enough, you can become good at anything. But is this true?

A psychologist named Anders Ericsson said that to become an expert in something, you need to practice for 10,000 hours. This idea is popular and has been written about in many books. However, not everyone agrees with this idea. A writer named Epstein thinks that there is more to it than just practice. He says that some people are naturally good at things and that it's hard to change that.

Epstein looked at many examples to understand why some people are good at certain things. He went to different places around the world and talked to people who are good at different things. He found that sometimes it's not just about practice, but also about who you are and where you come from.

For example, he looked at sled dogs in Alaska and found that their drive and desire to work can be inherited. This means that some people might be naturally more driven than others. Epstein also talked about the importance of environment and training, but he also said that sometimes it's hard to ignore the role of genes.

Epstein also looked at how men and women are treated differently in sports. He asked, ""If only practice matters, then why do we separate men and women in competitions?"" Sometimes the best questions are the most obvious ones.

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A2 learner:

Many children in rich countries are unhappy and feel lonely. Jay Griffiths, a writer, thinks she knows why. She says that children are not spending enough time outside, playing in nature. They are stuck inside, looking at screens, and this is making them unhappy.

A recent study talked to children to find out why they were unhappy. The children didn't say they wanted more gadgets or technology. Instead, many of them said they would be happier if they could go outside more often.

Many adults remember their own childhoods fondly, when they were free to play outside all day. They think this was better than the way children live now. However, these adults are also the ones who are keeping their own children indoors, worrying about their safety.

Griffiths argues that parents are too scared to let their children take risks and have adventures. This is because they are worried about danger. But Griffiths says that children need to take some risks to learn how to be safe.

Some people might agree with Griffiths, but others might think that not all children want to be adventurous. Some children are happy to stay at home and play quietly. We should let children make their own choices and not force them all to be the same.

* Shortened sentences and paragraphs to make them easier to understand

Here is the simplified text:

I'm a psychologist who studies how children learn and grow. I think that school is not the best way to teach children important skills. Children learn best through play. All mammals, including humans, play when they are young. Children need to play to learn how to think creatively, get along with others, and control their emotions. These skills are not taught in school, but they are learned through play.

Play is important because it helps children develop important skills like creativity, social skills, and self-control. Creativity is important for success in life. We need people who can think creatively and solve new problems. Play is also important for social skills, like getting along with others and working together.

Unfortunately, schools are not giving children enough time to play. They have too much homework and not enough breaks. This is not good for children. Children need to be allowed to play and explore on their own, without adult supervision. If we want our children to grow up to be strong and successful, we need to give them more time to play.

We need to change the way we think about childhood. We need to let children be children and follow their natural desire to play and explore. This will help them develop into strong, confident, and creative adults.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for an A2 level learner:

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to look for a job. Websites like Twitter and LinkedIn can help them connect with potential employers. But it's easy to make mistakes. For example, a young job seeker in the US sent a message to a senior marketing executive on LinkedIn. The executive was not happy with the request and sent a mean and sarcastic reply. This made people upset, but it also reminded everyone that social media can be a dangerous tool for job hunting if you don't know how to use it.

Many young people use social media every day, but they don't always understand how to use it for professional purposes. When they were teenagers, social media was a place to have fun and be themselves. They didn't think about how their online behavior would affect their future careers.

Now, they need to learn how to use social media in a professional way. This means being polite and respectful when contacting people online. It's not enough to just send a message and expect a response. You need to explain who you are and what you can do for the person you're contacting.

Some employers complain that young job seekers are too familiar and come across as arrogant. This is not true. Many young people are really struggling to find a job and are just trying to make a good impression. They need to learn how to use social media correctly to get noticed.

Here are some tips for using social media for job hunting: be clear about who you are and what you can do for the person you're contacting. Don't send impersonal messages, and be humble. Remember, social media can be a great tool, but you need to use it carefully to get the results you want.<|eot_id|>"

Newspapers are in trouble. Many people think they will disappear soon. But newspapers have survived for a long time. They were new once, and it took a while for them to become popular. They became popular because it was easier and cheaper to print news for many people. People also started to think that they needed to know what was happening in the world all the time.

But now, with the internet, people can get news whenever they want. They can choose what they want to read and when. They can also correct mistakes and misunderstandings quickly. Newspapers have space limits, but online news doesn't. People can read more and learn more.

Some people think newspapers are not good at explaining how the world works. They might disappear. Or, they might find a new way to help us understand the world.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

We are not meant to be in the dark, but we are daytime creatures. Our eyes are used to seeing in the sunlight, not in the moonlight. This is because our bodies are designed to be awake during the day and sleep at night. We have changed the night by putting lots of lights outside. This is called light pollution. It's like building a dam to control the river. But, just like a dam can cause problems, light pollution can harm many living things, including us.

In the past, people didn't use so many lights. They used candles, torches, and lanterns. If you walked in London at night, you would have seen very little light. Now, we use many lights and it's hard to see the stars. Many animals are affected by light pollution. Some birds get lost and crash into buildings because of the bright lights. Some birds even sing at the wrong times because of the artificial light.

We think that light pollution only affects astronomers, but it affects all living things. We need darkness to be healthy. Without darkness, our bodies get confused and we can get sick. We are like the frogs near a brightly lit highway. We are trapped in our own light and we are losing our connection to nature and the universe. We need to remember that we are part of the world and we should respect the natural rhythms of day and night.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

A big company has decided not to keep track of how many holidays its employees take. This idea came from another company that does the same thing. The boss of the big company says that his employees can take as many holidays as they want, as long as they make sure their work is done and their colleagues are not affected. But is this a good idea?

The problem is that the big company has many employees and different departments, so it's hard to know if someone's absence will affect the work. It's also hard to be sure that everything is done before you go on holiday. This means that employees might not take holidays at all, or they might feel guilty and stressed.

In the past, people had a certain amount of holiday time that they could take, and this helped them relax and recharge. Without this, people might not take holidays or might feel like they have to work all the time. This could make them unhappy and less productive.

Technology has changed the way we work, and some people might think that unlimited holidays are a good idea. But it's important to remember that workers need rest and leisure time to be healthy and happy. The law exists to protect workers and make sure they have a good work-life balance.

I'm not sure if unlimited holidays are a good idea, and I think it's important to think about the consequences before making a decision.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text:

Journal-based peer review is a way to check scientific research papers by experts in the same field. It's meant to make sure the research is good and correct. But is it worth waiting a year for? Some people think it's not. They think it's better to share research quickly and let others check it. This is called a preprint.

Preprints are drafts of papers that are shared online before they're officially published. They help scientists share their work quickly and get feedback from others. This is important because scientists often only share their best work to get a good reputation and get ahead in their careers. But this can lead to problems. Some scientists might not share all their results because they're not as good as they thought. And reviewers might focus on whether a paper is good enough for a top journal, rather than whether it's good science.

Preprints can help fix these problems. They allow scientists to share their work quickly and get feedback from others. They also make it clear that the research is not final until it's officially published. Some scientists are already using preprints and they like it. They can share their work quickly and get feedback from others. They can also share their results, even if they're not as good as they thought.

Preprints can help scientists focus on the research itself, not where it's published. They can share their work openly and get feedback from others. This can help science move forward faster and make it more transparent.

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it's like a picture made with words. But I don't think that's a good answer. One day, I asked my students to choose an object and write two paragraphs about it. One paragraph should be like a scientist writing about the object, and the other paragraph should be from the object's point of view. One student chose an oxygen mask. It was an unusual choice, but it helped us understand what poetry is.

When I was in school, I didn't like poetry. I thought it was confusing and didn't make sense. But poetry is different from other writing. It's not like a story or an article. Poetry is special because it can be ambiguous. This means it can have many meanings. We don't always know what a poem means, and that's okay. Poetry is like a surprise.

Some people think poetry is like a machine or a wild animal. But these comparisons don't really work. Poetry is something unique. It's like a song that gets stuck in your head. Poetry can make you think differently about things. It can make you see things in a new way.

A poem is like a special object. It's not like a commodity, something that is made to be sold. A poem is something that is made for its own sake. It's special because it can surprise us.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

I bought a metal detector after I got married. It was expensive, but my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. Over the years, I've found many other old things that give me a sense of connection to the past. It's a feeling I really enjoy.

After the gold ring, I didn't find anything special for 40 years. One rainy day, I decided to search a spot near my house. The detector beeped, and I found a piece of an old wheel. Then it beeped again, and I couldn't ignore it. I dug down and found a round, golden object. I was excited, but I didn't want to get my hopes up. As I cleaned it, I saw that it was a beautiful, intricate loop. I knew it was special, like something I'd seen in a museum.

I took it home and showed it to Marion. She was surprised and happy for me. We didn't try it on because it's very valuable and we didn't want to damage it. We hid it in our house, but I was worried about it being stolen. So, I hid it in my office under a floorboard.

The law says that if you find something valuable, you have to tell the authorities within 14 days. I wanted to enjoy it for a bit longer, so I took it to show a friend in the hospital. Finally, I took it to the council office and gave it to them. They said it was very old and valuable, and they sold it to the British Museum. We got £350,000, which we split between us.

People ask me if I'm going to stop searching now that I've found something big, but I don't think so. I still enjoy finding old things, and you never know when you might find something even better.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

Sleeping is one of my favorite things to do when I travel. I don't talk about it much because I feel a little shy. When my friends tell me about their exciting trips, I smile and don't say much. They plan every minute of their trip, but I prefer to have some free time to sleep. I like to take long naps in the afternoon, especially when it rains. I also like to sleep in late in the morning, feeling cozy in my bed.

I remember when I visited the Yucatán coast in Mexico. I slept a lot, more than 12 hours a day. It was strange, but I felt very relaxed and happy. I didn't even notice the loud birds outside.

I think that sleep is important when you travel. It helps you feel refreshed and ready for the next day. When you sleep, you can process all the new things you've seen and experienced. It's like your brain is cleaning up all the new information.

I also like that sleep is different in different places. In some countries, people sleep at different times, and it takes me a while to adjust. But when I finally sleep like the locals, I feel like I'm really a part of the place.

I remember one time in the Dominican Republic when I took a big lunch with some new friends. We ate a lot and then everyone started to feel tired. We all lay down on the couches and hammocks, and I realized that this was a normal thing to do. It was a special experience, and I felt like I was really a part of the culture.

I think it's okay to take time to sleep when you travel. It's not just about rushing around and seeing everything. Sometimes, the best things are the quiet moments, like sleeping in a new place.<|eot_id|>"

Doug used to be a marine biologist and commercial diver. He learned about survival in cold places while diving. One day, a TV crew came to Antarctica where he was working, and he started filming wildlife. He loved it! He got to travel, have adventures, and film underwater.

Doug is now a top cameraman and has worked on many big TV shows. When he started, not many people had been to the Antarctic, so he became known as the ""cold man"". He says it's easier to film now because of new technology. He used to have to remember what shots to take, but now he can shoot a lot and look at it right away.

Doug has a lot of experience filming in cold places. He's spent a lot of time on sea ice and is comfortable there. He says it's a great place to work because there are no bugs or diseases.

Filming wildlife can be hard sometimes. Doug once got stuck in the Orkneys and didn't know what kind of birds he was filming. But he's also had some amazing experiences. He recently went to a place in the Arctic to film polar bears and had to wait for 23 days to see one. When he finally saw a mother bear and her cub, he was so excited!

Here is the simplified text:

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at a party in a hotel ballroom. They were from Tokyo and a European city, and they were older than Lucy. They talked about their music and where they had been and where they were going next. Lucy told them she was going to Tanglewood, a famous music festival. But she didn't really want to go. She had been traveling a lot for her music, and she missed school. She was working with tutors from a university instead.

Lucy's mom had signed her up for the Prague Festival without asking her. Lucy didn't want to be disappointed if she didn't get in, but she wished her mom had asked her first. The man from Tokyo asked Lucy how old she was, and she said 15. He and the other woman were surprised. Lucy didn't mean to brag, but it was hard to know how much to share about her music.

Lucy's grandfather came over and took her away from the conversation. He said she shouldn't get too friendly with the other pianists, because they were her competition. Lucy's grandfather made her talk to a lot of people, but she didn't really listen to what they were saying. After the party, her grandfather said he was proud of her and that everyone knew who she was. Lucy liked being a famous pianist, even if some people were jealous.

'My dad says I should spend less time online and more time outside. But I wanted to know what experts think about social media. They say that most teenagers who use social media have many friends, feel good about themselves, and learn important skills. Simon Miles, an expert, says social media is just a part of modern life. It's not good or bad, it just depends on how you use it.

Jim Matthews, another expert, says social media is like a virtual youth club. Teenagers use it to share jokes and gossip with friends, just like their parents did when they were younger. It helps them develop their identity and learn to deal with problems.

Psychologist Keith Davidson says social media can help teenagers figure out who they are. They can share their interests and see what others like. He also says it's good for shy people, as they can practice social skills online.

Andrew Phillips, a researcher, says social media can be helpful for quiet people with special interests. They can connect with others who like the same things. Pauline White, an education expert, says social media can be a creative force. Teenagers can make videos, podcasts, and blogs about things they like. This can help them in the future when they look for a job.

All the experts agree that social media is important. It can help teenagers develop skills and be successful in their careers.'

My parents planned a big road trip for our summer vacation. They wanted to visit nine states in the US and one province in Canada. I wasn't excited about it because it meant we would be in the car for a long time and I would miss my privacy. We packed our car with suitcases, food, and clothes for different weather. We left our home and started driving west. We saw many exciting things, like the stars at night and the Great Sand Dunes. We also visited Yellowstone National Park and saw bears. My family and I had some funny moments, like when we got lost on a small road and had to turn back. We stayed in a old hotel with no internet or phone signal, but we enjoyed the beautiful views. After two weeks, we went back home. I was happy to be back, but I also had many good memories of our trip.<|eot_id|>"

Rose Frost is 16 years old. She will live with her grandmother, Daisy, because her parents are moving away. Her father has a job in another country, and her mother will join him. Rose's sister Amy will stay in England and finish her school. Amy will live with the college head, who will help her.

Rose is moving to her grandmother's house. She doesn't know her grandmother very well because she only saw her a few times when she was a child. Her parents didn't want her to live with her grandmother, but Daisy said it was okay and wanted to get to know Rose better.

Rose's grandmother is a social person who likes to go out and meet people. Rose is excited to live with her because she will have new experiences and make new friends. Rose's parents gave her a new phone so she can stay in touch with them.

Rose wants to be independent and make her own decisions. She wants to be able to play music loudly, invite friends over, and go out without asking permission every time. Her grandmother agreed to trust her and let her make her own choices. If they have any problems, they will talk about it and find a solution.

Rose is starting a new school in a few weeks. It's her fourth school in five years, but she is happy to be finishing her education and starting her final two years. She is excited for this new chapter in her life.<|eot_id|>"

Charlotte Grainger is a 15-year-old girl who wrote a novel. Her teacher thought she might write a book when she was older, but Charlotte decided to try when she was 13. Now, her book is going to be published. Charlotte's teacher was surprised to hear that she finished the book so quickly. Charlotte thinks that being a teenager doesn't mean you're not good at something. She wrote about a character who takes responsibility and faces challenges.

Charlotte doesn't like books that only show teenagers as outsiders, naive, or awkward. She wants to show that teenagers can be normal and fine. She likes to read fantasy books, but some of them made her feel like she couldn't write a good book. She found a book called How Not to Write a Novel helpful, which told her that if readers can guess what's going to happen, the book is boring.

Charlotte's parents are journalists, and they helped her get her book published. She thinks that getting someone to read her book was lucky, but after that, she had to work hard to make it good. Charlotte is proud of her book and doesn't take her success for granted.<|eot_id|>"

'Gareth, our teacher, told us, 'Speed is your friend, not your enemy.' We were about to try freestyle skiing for the first time. One of the group, David, who had some experience, went first. He went too fast and fell. Gareth said, 'Remember, speed is unpredictable.' I wasn't sure I was good at this. I liked skiing, but I didn't do tricks on ramps and half pipes like some teenagers. My parents signed us up for a freestyle skiing course in the US. We had a big indoor facility with trampolines and ski jumps. We practiced our moves indoors and then went outside to try them on the real slopes. Gareth said, 'Progression is inevitable!' He told us that before, people would just go down the slopes and hope for the best. But now, we could learn to ski safely. He warned us about the 'knuckle', the flat part of the jump. If we landed there, we would stop and it would hurt. So, we needed to go fast. At first, I found it hard to go fast and not be scared. My legs would stop moving and I would fall onto the knuckle. I was tired by the end of the day. Gareth told us, 'You need to control the jump, not let it control you.' The next day, we went back to the trampolines. I liked bouncing on them and learned some new moves. We also practiced 'aerial awareness', knowing what our bodies were doing when we were in the air. Gareth gave us tips. I still had trouble, but eventually I landed properly. I felt proud. But then I lost my skis!<|eot_id|>"

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. You're scared and nervous. The ride stops, then goes up slowly. Then it drops quickly and you feel like you're flying. You might scream with fear. But you chose to ride it, just like millions of other people every year. It's strange that amusement parks, which have scary rides, are a big business. To make the rides, there are many experts: engineers, designers, and marketers. They work together to create the perfect balance of fun and fear. They also want to make sure the riders are safe.

It's not easy to design a rollercoaster. You need to make sure it's fun, but not too scary. You also need to make it new and exciting, so people want to ride it again. Most of the techniques used today were invented a long time ago. The designers have to be creative and try different things to make the ride exciting. They need to make sure the ride is safe and fun for everyone.

I talked to three experts who design rollercoasters. They said that the key is to make the ride feel exciting and safe at the same time. They use different techniques to make the ride feel like you're flying or being thrown around, but still feel safe. They also need to create a story or theme for the ride, like a space adventure or a jungle chase, and make sure it works with the ride's features.

The experts said that experience and instinct are important in designing rollercoasters. They also need to test the ride before it opens to the public. They think that new technology, like virtual reality, can add something to the ride, but the physical experience of the rollercoaster will always be the most important part.<|eot_id|>"

Miranda Ellington is a choreographer who is 25 years old. She has already done a lot of work in the dance world. She also still dances sometimes. I asked her why she does both jobs. She said that dancing reminds her of what it's like to be in the studio and follow a choreographer's orders. As a choreographer, she likes working with young students. They are open to new ideas and don't know what they're good at or bad at yet. They listen to feedback and are eager to improve.

When Miranda starts working with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. She has to make sure the dance is good even if she doesn't like the music. Sometimes, the dancers don't like the music either, but she has to find a solution. She would like to be able to choose different music, but that's not always possible.

Miranda doesn't like to work with just one group all the time. She likes to work with different people and adapt her style to fit each group. She doesn't want to get too used to doing things one way.

We talked about a documentary about ballet dancers and choreographers. Miranda said it showed what life is really like in a dance company. She said that people don't understand how much work and dedication it takes to be a ballet dancer.

I asked Miranda what makes a good ballet or dance production. She said it's when everything comes together - the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. It's not always perfect, but aiming high is appreciated by the audience.

Miranda has done a lot of different types of dance. I asked if she is a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist. She said she doesn't like to be labeled and wants to keep exploring different styles.<|eot_id|>"

I had a conversation with a friend who asked me why I travel when I can watch everything on TV. I said that it's better to go out and experience things than just stay at home. This idea made me think of a project to make a film that encourages people to stop watching TV and go out. My friend gave me an old sofa, which became the main part of the film. I fixed it up and took it on a four-day trip. I slept on the sofa each night, even on the beach one night. Some friends joined me and helped me pull the sofa along the way. I've gone on many walks before, but this was something new. It was the longest distance I've ever walked, and I got to stop at cafes and relax on the sofa with a coffee. When people ask me about my weekend, I like to tell them about my adventure instead of talking about TV shows.

Here is the simplified text for an A2 learner:

I read about a group trip to swim in the sea around some small Greek islands. I had never done a group trip before. My brother was busy, so I decided to join a group. When I asked for a ticket at the port, the man seemed surprised because the islands are popular with families. I told him I would be with a group of ten people. He still looked confused, but he showed me to the boat with a smile.

Before we set off, we exchanged emails with each other. But we didn't have time to talk much before our first swim. Our guides told us that a support boat would be with us the whole time and showed us how to talk to it. We did a short swim to divide into fast and slow groups. Then, we did a longer swim, 1.5 kilometers, and I was a bit nervous. I had swum in my pool and in a river, but never in the open sea. The waves got bigger, and I was swimming with the slow group. I wanted to finish the swim, and I was happy when I did it on my own. The next days were the same: we jumped in, swam at a comfortable speed, and stopped to look at the beautiful views. As the swims got longer, I got faster and happier. I didn't need the support boat as much. I can't wait to go back next year.<|eot_id|>"

I don't think being a flight attendant is easy, but I love my job. I've been to many countries, like the US and Australia. I work with nice people and have a lot of free time. It's a great job for young people like me!

When I was a kid, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I had to fly alone, so I would often help the flight attendants serve food to the passengers. I liked doing that, and it made me happy. Later, I realized that's what I wanted to do as a job.

I had a boring job in banking before, and I wanted a change. So, I applied to be a flight attendant. Many young people were applying, and some were very smart like me. I prepared what to say during the interview, and I told them about my strengths and work experience. I got the job!

I would recommend this job to anyone. There are many good things about it. I get to travel a lot, and I work with nice people. We're like a big family, even though we don't see each other every day. When I'm not working, I don't have to think about work. And if I have a difficult passenger, I know the flight will soon be over, and I won't see them again!<|eot_id|>"

I work at a summer camp where I like seeing kids do things they didn't think they could do. Many kids know how to swim and play table tennis, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some kids are scared at first, but after we encourage them, they try and succeed. This makes them feel happy.

Some kids miss their home at the beginning, especially the older ones. We don't let them use their phones all the time. They can phone home after lunch, but not too many times. Most kids get used to it after a few days and thank us for a great time at the end.

It's not just kids who feel lonely. Sometimes parents call us too much, asking about their child. We tell them to call back another time because their child is busy playing or doing something else.

We also get kids who come dressed in fancy clothes. They don't like it when we tell them to change, but they understand why soon.

* Shortened sentences and paragraphs to make them easier to understand

A new musical show called Rock the Planet opened in London. It's a special show where the actors are also musicians. The show was very popular in the USA and won four awards. But it was harder to find actors in the UK because they have rules about how many shows they can do. So, they needed to find more actors. Luckily, they found many talented actors in the UK. The show is very popular in London and is full every night. People love the songs that were popular in America.

I met a young actor named Jamie who is 11 years old. He loves playing his guitar and gets paid to do it! He told me that he misses his old school friends because he has to go to school at the theatre. His parents can't always come to the show because it's expensive. But Jamie's school class came to see the show and they loved it. Jamie was very happy.

I also play guitar, so Jamie showed me his guitar and we played a song together. I was surprised that I could play it! Jamie is very good and I was happy to play with him. The young actors in the show are all musicians, but some of them had never played in a band before. They found it easy, but they had to practice to look natural on stage. The show will be in London for another year, and it's a great show to see.<|eot_id|>"
