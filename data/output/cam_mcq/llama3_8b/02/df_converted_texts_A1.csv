Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

Some time ago, a website talked about the dangers of sharing where you are online. The website said that when you share where you are, you are also telling many people that you are not at home. This can be a problem because not all of these people are nice. The website was saying that the internet can be a big risk. 

Many people like to share their lives on the internet. They put pictures and stories online. But sometimes they realize that the internet is a big place and it's easy to get lost. 

A long time ago, some brave people started sharing their lives online. They told us about the dangers of the internet and how to be careful. They got into trouble, like losing their jobs or friends, but they learned from their mistakes. 

One of these brave people was Justin Hall. He started sharing his life online in 1994. He wrote about his life, including things that might be private. He even posted pictures and art. Many people read his blog and loved it. 

But one day, his home page disappeared and he was very upset. He had fallen in love, but his partner didn't want him to write about it online. He had to choose between his blog and his partner. 

Another person, Heather Armstrong, had a blog called Dooce. She wrote about her job and sometimes made jokes about her bosses. But one of her bosses found her blog and she lost her job. This is called the ""online distribution effect"". It means that we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But the internet is connected to our real lives, and we have to be careful what we say. 

Heather Armstrong learned from her mistake and started a new blog about her family. Now she is a famous blogger and makes money from her writing. She learned that we can say many things online, but we should think carefully before we do.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

A long time ago, some scientists were worried about a movie called What the Bleep Do We Know?. The movie is about how we don't know many things about the universe. Scientists are not perfect and can't know everything. Some scientists thought the movie was very bad and warned people about it. But I didn't understand what the fuss was about at first. The movie talked about new discoveries that show the universe is very strange. One interesting thing it talked about is that water can be affected by our thoughts. I had heard about this before, but the movie didn't show very good evidence. It just showed some nice pictures of ice crystals. Some people like this kind of evidence, but scientists want more proof. They think it's important to have good evidence before we believe something. 

The movie didn't talk about very big discoveries. For example, scientists have found that the universe is made of a special kind of matter that we don't know about. They also found that our brains work in a special way. We don't notice it because our brains help us. Some scientists think they have found out where humans came from and how they left their home to live in the world. All of these discoveries show that we don't know everything about the universe. In fact, scientists are now trying to understand the universe better. They are working on a big theory that will explain everything about the universe. For many of us, the universe is amazing and incredible.<|eot_id|>"

I like writing short stories more than writing novels. Writing novels is like planting a big forest, while writing short stories is like planting a small garden. Both are important to me. When I finish a novel, I want to write some short stories. When I finish a group of short stories, I want to write a novel. I don't write short stories while I'm writing a novel, and I don't write a novel while I'm writing short stories. It takes time to switch from one to the other.

I started writing short stories in 1984. It was hard at first, but it was fun. I felt happy because I could try new things and explore my imagination. My readers liked my short stories too. One of my favorite short stories is called ""Breaking Waves"". It's part of a collection of stories called ""Tales from Abroad"".

I like writing short stories because they are quick to finish. It usually takes me a week to write a short story. It's like a short trip to a new place. When I finish, I can leave and do something else. Writing novels takes a long time, sometimes a year or two. It's like a long journey. Sometimes I feel tired and wonder if I can finish.

I also like that short stories can be about small things, like a word or an idea. It's like playing jazz music, and the story takes me where it wants to go. If the story doesn't work out, I don't worry. I just try again. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write great short stories. I learn from my mistakes and use them to write better stories.

My short stories are like little marks I leave in the world. I remember where I wrote each one and how I felt. Short stories are like messages to my heart, and it makes me happy to share them with my readers.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for an A1 learner:

Science is a way of understanding the world. It helps us learn about the universe, from the smallest things to the biggest. Science is important, but it can also be complicated and sometimes confusing. Many scientists have different ideas about how things work. Sometimes, these ideas change and new ones take their place. This is because science is always changing and growing.

Scientists have made many discoveries that have helped us in our daily lives. They have also made some mistakes, but they keep trying to learn more. Some people think that science is too hard to understand, but it's actually very interesting.

In the past, people used to think that science was only about finding new things, but now we know that it's also about using what we know to make the world a better place. We have to be careful with science because it can also cause problems if we don't use it wisely.

As a result, it's important for everyone to understand a little bit about science. We should be aware of what's happening in the world of science and how it might affect our lives. This way, we can make better decisions about our future and the future of our planet.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

Some time ago, people who sell books started to say that they were selling fewer ebooks. This made them wonder if ebooks would be a good business in the future. One person who works in the book business said that maybe they had invested too much in ebooks and that the excitement about them was over. But even though ebooks and printed books can both be used, people still talk about whether ebooks will replace printed books. This idea is interesting because it makes us think about how we feel about new things and how we like to use old things.

This idea is not new. When new things come out, people often think that old things will disappear. For example, when TV came out, people thought radio would stop being popular. But radio is still used today. People listen to the radio in cars, on trains, and at work.

We like to think about new things and how they might change our lives. We also like to think about how we might lose things we like. When new things come out, we often think about how we will miss the old things. This is why people like old things, like vinyl records, and why they still use them.

Even when new things come out, we still use old things. For example, when ebooks came out, people started to like printed books again. This is because we like to hold things in our hands and smell the paper. We like to use old things because they make us feel happy.

The idea that ebooks will replace printed books is a good story to tell. It makes us think about how we feel about new things and how we like to use old things. It also makes us think about how we like to change and how we like to keep some things the same.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for an A1 learner:

I wrote a book about famous people's daily routines. I wanted to know how they did their best work. I thought that if I shared the small details of their daily lives, like when they woke up, ate, and worked, it would help us understand them better.

The idea is simple: 'Tell me what time you eat, and I'll tell you what you are.' This book is about how creative people organize their days to be productive. It's not about their final work, but about how they do it.

I struggled with the same questions in my own life. How do I do my best work and earn a living? Should I focus on one thing or do a little bit of everything? When I don't have enough time, what should I give up? I don't have the answers, but I tried to show how other successful people solved these problems.

The book's title is Daily Rituals, but it's really about people's routines. A routine can be good or bad. Good routines help us be more productive and happy. The famous psychologist William James said that we should make some parts of our life automatic, so we can focus on more important things.

I started writing this book because I was procrastinating. I was supposed to write a story, but instead, I tidied my office and made coffee. I thought, 'Why not find out how other writers work?' I found some interesting stories and started a blog. Then, I wrote this book.

I used quotes from famous people's letters, diaries, and interviews. I also used information from other books and articles. I want to thank the researchers who helped me with my book. I included all my sources at the end of the book, so you can read more about these people.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text:

Howard became a palaeontologist because of a special moment when he was six years old. His family couldn't go on holiday to Spain because of high interest rates. Instead, they went to the beach in England. Howard found an ammonite on the beach and knew he wanted to be a palaeontologist.

As he grew older, Howard became more interested in the early days of the earth. He didn't like the big, famous fossils like dinosaurs. He liked the small, ancient creatures on the rocks. Howard studied hard and got a doctorate. He wanted a job at a special place, but he wasn't sure if he would get it.

Howard applied for a job at Tavistock College in London. He didn't think he would get it, but he got the job! Later, he found out that someone helped him get the job. Howard was happy to have the job and to do the work he loved.

Howard's life was calm and planned, but sometimes things didn't go as planned. One day, someone stole his notes for a lecture. Howard was upset and had to change his plans. He met a friend who told him about a new collection of fossils at the Natural History Museum in Nairobi. Howard wanted to study these fossils and went to Nairobi to see them. If the theft hadn't happened, Howard might not have gone to Nairobi and might not have had this amazing opportunity.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

Professor Charles Spence loves to eat different foods. He even eats bee larvae! They might look a bit yucky, but they taste a bit like nuts and flowers. Professor Spence is a scientist who studies how our senses work together to make food taste good or bad. He helps big food companies and restaurants make better food. He thinks about things like who you eat with, what the food looks like, and what kind of music is playing. Did you know that the person who orders first in a restaurant usually likes their food the most? And did you know that you eat more food when you eat with friends?

Professor Spence's lab is not very high-tech. It's just a normal room with some old equipment. He likes to work with cooks who can't afford to do big research projects. He gets money from a big food company to do his research. He helps them make food that is healthier, like food with less salt and sugar. He also helps them make food that tastes better. He thinks that if people know that food is being changed, they might not like it as much.

Professor Spence worked with a famous chef named Heston Blumenthal. They made a special dish together that used sound to make the food taste better. Now, food companies are using Professor Spence's ideas to make their products better. He thinks that music can make food taste sweeter or bitter. An airline is going to play music with the food they serve to their passengers. A company even made a smartphone app that plays music while you eat ice cream!

Professor Spence has fun at home with his family. They have dinner parties and try new foods. They even play with lights and music to see how it affects the taste of the food.<|eot_id|>"

Our brains are very busy. We get a lot of information, but it's hard to know what's true and what's not. We have to sort through it all to find what we need. We're doing more things on our own now. Thirty years ago, travel agents helped us book flights and salespeople helped us find things we needed. Now we do it all ourselves. We're doing many things at once, but our brains are not good at this. We think we're doing many things, but really we're just switching between them quickly. This makes our brains work harder and can make us feel stressed and confused.

Our brains are not good at multitasking. We think we're doing many things, but really we're just switching between them quickly. This makes our brains work harder and can make us feel stressed and confused. It's like trying to spin many plates at once. We might think we're doing well, but really we're not getting as much done as we think.

We also get a lot of emails and messages. This can be overwhelming. We feel like we have to answer them all, but it's hard to do this and get anything else done. It's like trying to do many things at once, but really we're just switching between them quickly. This can make us feel stressed and confused.

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

A long time ago, people thought animals just did things without feeling or thinking. They thought animals were like machines. But now, scientists are learning more about animals and their feelings. They are finding out that animals can feel happy, sad, and even care for each other.

In a zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino liked to break things at night. People thought he was being mean. But maybe he was just trying to have fun. In the US, some bats help each other when they have babies. They are being kind.

Some scientists think animals can think and feel like we do. They say we should treat animals with respect and kindness. Others think we should not eat animals because they can feel pain and happiness like we do.

A scientist named Dr. Balcombe says we should stop eating meat. He thinks it's wrong to eat animals. Another scientist, Professor Manning, says we should learn more about animals and how they think. He thinks animals are smart and can solve problems.

There is a big debate about how to treat animals. Some people think we should stop eating animals, while others think we should just be kind to them. It's a difficult question, and we may never have a clear answer.<|eot_id|>"

'Critical thinking is when we think deeply about what we read or hear to understand it better. Adrian West, a researcher, says that people think that arguing is a good way to find the truth. But he also thinks that technology can make it harder for us to think clearly. We are exposed to a lot of information, but it can be hard to sort out what is important and what is not.

West says that we need to be careful because there is a lot of poor thinking around. We also need to be careful because too much information can be overwhelming. 

Reading is important for our thinking. But some people think that reading is not as popular as it used to be. This might be because people are spending more time watching videos and playing games. Patricia Greenfield, a psychologist, says that reading is good for our thinking because it helps us use our imagination and think critically. 

But some games and videos can also be good for our thinking. James Paul Gee, an educational psychologist, says that games can be a good way to learn and think critically. Some games, like Sim City and Civilization, teach us to make good decisions and think logically.

It's important to understand how technology affects our thinking and learning. We need to be careful and make sure we are using technology in a way that helps us think clearly and learn well.'

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic and writer. He used to work in an office, but he didn't like it. He wrote a book about the benefits of doing things by hand. His new book is about how to deal with modern life. He was inspired to write it when he saw ads on a credit card machine. He thought it was hard to avoid distractions.

We are all being asked to pay attention to many things at the same time. This can make it hard to think and remember things. People are getting used to ignoring each other and not talking to strangers. We are getting used to seeing the world through screens and apps on our phones. These things show us what we want and can take over our lives.

Matthew Crawford is not the only one who is worried. Many people are tired of emails and social media. We don't know if our attention spans are getting shorter, but we know that we are more aware of the things we could be doing. Some people think that technology is the problem, but Matthew thinks it's because we are too focused on ourselves.

He thinks we need to make some changes. We need to make public spaces quieter and less distracting. We also need to find ways to engage with the world in a more meaningful way. For example, we could try cooking, playing sports, or riding a motorcycle. These things require us to use our judgment and pay attention to what's around us. This can make us more focused and able to pay attention to others.

It's not about becoming a chef or a professional athlete, but about finding ways to use our judgment and pay attention to the world around us. This can make our lives more satisfying and help us connect with others.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A1 learner:

'What do you do for a living?' This is a common question. But what if you are a philosopher like me? It's hard to explain what I do because people often think that philosophers are special or know more than others. This is not true. Philosophers are just people who think about life and try to understand it. They are not special.

A long time ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle said that thinking is the most important thing in life. Many people still think this way. But it's not true. You don't have to be a philosopher to think about life. You can think about your own life and make good choices.

Philosophers often get stuck in their own world and don't talk to others about their ideas. This is because they are busy writing papers for other experts. But this is not good. Philosophers should share their ideas with everyone, not just with other experts.

I am an ethicist, which means I think about what is right and wrong. But I think this is not the only thing philosophers do. They can help us think about our daily lives and make good choices. For example, we can think about whether it's right to download movies without paying for them. We can also think about our attitudes towards art and how we buy things.

Philosophy is not just about being smart or knowing a lot. It's about thinking about life and making good choices. Anyone can do this, not just philosophers.'<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for an A1 learner:

Food is important for many people. They like to think about what they eat and how they eat it. But philosophers, who think deeply about life, haven't always talked about food. They usually talk about other things, like how to get knowledge. Sometimes, they mention food, but it's just a way to explain something else.

One famous philosopher, Epicurus, said that people should try to be happy and avoid being sad. He said this about many things, not just eating. But now, people often think of Epicurus when they talk about food and drinks. Some restaurants and shops use his name because they think it will make people want to try their food.

Food is a big part of our lives. We eat with our families and friends. We share food with people from our community. Food comes from our history and culture. We eat different foods because of where we come from.

Some people, like food critics, like to write about food. They say what they think is good or bad about a meal. But why do they get to decide what's good? Maybe it's because they're good at describing how food tastes.

Food is also beautiful. We talk about how beautiful paintings or music are, but not about how food tastes. Some people think food should be considered beautiful, like a work of art. But food is eaten, so it can't be kept around like a painting.

There are many questions about food. What should we eat? Should we eat food that is good for the environment? Should we eat food that is not genetically modified? These questions show what we believe.

Cooking at home is different from cooking in a restaurant. At home, we cook for our friends and family. In a restaurant, the cook has to make food for many people, not just friends. This is a big responsibility.

Food can bring people together. We can learn about other cultures by eating their food. We can also make friends with people from other cultures by eating together. This has been happening for a long time, even in international diplomacy.

Rob Daviau, a game designer from the US, wanted to make board games more exciting. He thought, ""Why can't games have a story? Why can't our choices affect the next game?"" He created a new version of the game Risk, called Risk Legacy. In this game, players make choices that affect the game forever. They might tear up cards or change the board. The game is played over many sessions, and players can remember what happened before.

Daviau worked on another game called Pandemic Legacy. In this game, players work together to save the world from diseases. He also created a new game called SeaFall. In SeaFall, players are sailors who explore the ocean and discover new lands.

To make sure the game is fun and makes sense, game designers need to test it many times. They want to see how players make choices and what happens next. One tester, Jaime Barriga, said it takes a lot of time to test a game. ""It's like a big puzzle,"" he said.

People love playing legacy games because they are like an adventure. They get to make choices and see what happens next. One player, Russell Chapman, said, ""It's like a new level of excitement. You never know what will happen next.""

Some people thought legacy games would only be for a few people, but many people love them. The idea of legacy games is like a new way to tell a story. It's like a TV show or a video game. The game designer, Rob Daviau, is happy to see people enjoy his idea, but he also wants to see what other people will come up with.

One night, an octopus named Inky got out of his tank at a big aquarium in New Zealand. He crawled across the floor and went down a small pipe to the ocean. This is a fun story that people like to tell. It's fun to imagine animals doing human-like things.

Octopuses are very smart. They can open jars, recognize faces, and even play. But some people don't think animals are smart because they are different from humans. Dr. Frans de Waal thinks this is not true. He says it's because we don't want to admit that animals are smart like us.

Dr. de Waal looked at many studies about animal intelligence. He found that animals can do many things that we thought only humans could do. They can think about the past and future, be kind to each other, and understand what others are thinking. Animals are smarter than we thought.

A long time ago, people thought animals were smart too. They even put animals on trial for doing bad things. But in the 20th century, people started to think animals were just machines that reacted to things. This was a bad time for animals. People were hurting animals and not taking care of them.

Now, Dr. de Waal thinks people are starting to understand animals better. We're learning that animals are smart in their own way. We need to design tests that are right for each animal, not just for humans. For example, squirrels are great at remembering where they hide nuts, but they might not do well on human memory tests.

A scientist named Sy Montgomery wrote a book about octopuses. She said that if an octopus tested human intelligence, it might think we're not very smart because we can't change color like they can.

Dr. de Waal is not sure if Inky really got to the ocean, but he thinks it's nice that people are interested in animal intelligence. He did an experiment with monkeys and found out that they can feel jealous. When monkeys got a treat, but their friends got a better one, they got very upset.

'Robots are becoming more important. They will change many jobs. Some people think robots will take over most jobs in the next 50 years. But many people think their jobs will stay the same. This is not true. Robots will affect many jobs, not just a few.

A company in Australia has made a robot that can lay 1,000 bricks in one hour. A robot in a supermarket in the USA helps keep the store clean and makes sure everything is in order. Some people think robots will create new jobs for technicians and programmers. Others worry that robots will take away the human touch.

A expert on robots, Dr. Zhang, says that robots will get smarter and more efficient. He thinks many companies will have a person in charge of robots. Governments will make laws about robots. The salary for people who work with robots will increase, but some jobs will be hard to find because there won't be enough people with the right skills.

Dr. Zhang says that people who don't have the right skills will have to learn new things to keep their jobs. He says it's not possible to do the same job forever. We need to learn more about science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM) to be ready for the jobs of the future.'

'Why do people climb mountains?' This is a question that many people ask. George Mallory, a famous mountain climber, said, ""Because it's there."" This answer is simple, but it shows that sometimes people climb because it's fun and exciting.

Climbing is not just about reaching the top of a mountain. It's also about the journey, the challenges, and the feelings you get along the way. Some people love climbing because it makes them feel free and happy. Others like it because it's a way to test themselves and see what they can do.

There are different types of climbing, like climbing small rocks or big mountains. Each type has its own rules and challenges. Climbers use different ways to climb, like using ropes or climbing alone. Some people like climbing because it's a way to be alone and challenge themselves.

Climbing can also be a way to learn important things like courage, humility, and respect for nature. Climbers who climb alone have to be very focused and committed to their goal. This can be a good way to learn to rely on themselves and be brave.

Some people think that climbing is a way to connect with nature and feel at peace. Climbing can be like meditation, where you focus on the present moment and let go of worries.

Lawrence shows me around the island. He points to another island and says it's called Eigg. There's another one called Rum, and it gets a lot more rain than we do. We walk down the hill and Lawrence tells me more about the island. It's a special place where his family has lived for a long time.

We have to move the sheep to a new place. Lawrence's dog, Tie, helps us. But sometimes he doesn't listen and causes trouble. Lawrence is a little upset, but Tie looks sorry.

The Isle of Muck is a special place where Lawrence's family lives. His wife, Jenny, runs the hotel, and his son and daughter-in-law run the cottages. They love it here because they can play outside and sail boats in the summer.

There are some things that are different about living on the island. We don't always have electricity, so we have to use candles and torches. We also can't use our phones all the time. But we like it here because it's peaceful and we have everything we need.

One day, some musicians come to the island and play music in the tearoom. Everyone loves it and dances along. At night, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. It's a nice story.

I eat well on the island because everything is fresh and delicious. I even get to go fishing with Sandy, the fisherman. We catch some fish and bring it back to the hotel. It's yummy!

The next day, I have to leave the island, but I'm a little sad because I don't want to go. The ferry ride is rough, but I'm glad I got to stay on the island for a while.<|eot_id|>"

""The video game industry is growing and becoming more serious. It used to be hard to get into, but now there are more opportunities. To work in the industry, you need to be good at making games. You don't need a degree in computer science, but you do need to make games to get a job. It's not just about making games, it's a way of life. You need to be creative and have good ideas.

It's hard to get a job in a big company, but there are smaller companies and independent game designers who can help you get started. You can also learn by taking a course or working with others who are interested in game design.

The industry needs people who can design games and make them fun. It's not just about making games, but also about understanding how people play and what they like. You need to be good at art, programming, and other skills too.

It's not just kids who play games, but grown-ups and families too. With smartphones and social media, there are many ways to play games. The industry is growing and there are many opportunities to learn and have fun.""

'I have always loved playing football. My dad encouraged me to play when I was a child. He didn't force me, and I'm grateful for that. I had a friend who used to play with us, but his dad was always telling him what to do. My friend got upset and stopped playing. I'm glad that didn't happen to me. When I score a goal, people say it's just luck, but it's not. I practice a lot to get good at it. The best players in the world are good because they practice a lot too.

I used to play many sports at school. I loved playing football the most. I want my son to enjoy learning too. We're reading books to him already. I hope he likes it. At the beginning of my football career, our manager helped us young players. He didn't make a big fuss about it, but we knew we had to work hard.

I score goals, but sometimes we lose. One time, a TV presenter said we couldn't win with young players. That made us work harder. I'm lucky to have good friends and family. They help me a lot. Sometimes, having a lot of money can cause problems. People think my mom should stop working, but she loves her job. I help my family sometimes, like paying off their house loan. I want to use my money to make things easier for the people around me.

When I stop playing football, I want to take a break and do things I haven't done before. I want to go skiing. But I can't do that now because if I get hurt, I won't be able to play football again.'

We moved to Reef Point because of Sam Carter. He was my father's friend in Los Angeles. My father couldn't write his book while we lived there, and Sam helped us find a new place to live. Reef Point is a small beach town. It's not very popular with tourists because the road is not nice, and there's a better beach nearby. But now, with the hot weather, more people are coming to visit. My father is working hard to finish his book. I like to go to the beach and read with my dog, Rusty. He's a friendly dog and likes to play with me.

One day, a girl came to the beach to surf. She was very good at it! She asked me why I didn't join her, but I don't have a surfboard. She said I could buy one, but I don't have money. She asked where I'm from, and I said I live here. She asked if my father is American, and I said no. He came to write a book. She knew the book, ""Tall as the Morning"". She read it and liked it.

Violet Hetherington was waiting in a long line at the dock in Southampton. She was going on a cruise. Her friend Annie had told her to get to the dock late, but now Violet was worried. The line wasn't moving and there was an announcement saying that the computer system had broken down. 

Violet was annoyed. She had paid a lot of money for this trip and she wanted it to be special. But now it seemed like everything was going wrong. She couldn't even find her phone, which had all her important numbers on it. 

A kind-looking couple behind her in the line offered to let her use their phone to call her son, Harry. Violet asked Harry to ask her neighbor, Kristina, to check if she had left her phone in her flat. 

Finally, the line started moving and Violet went to the window to show her travel papers. She was disappointed when she saw the ship's foyer. It was not as nice as she had expected. The carpets and decorations were like those at an airport. 

Violet got into the elevator, which was crowded and had mirrors all around. She was relieved to finally reach her room on the 12th floor.

Eleanor Catton wrote a big book called The Luminaries. It's a mystery story about crimes in New Zealand a long time ago. The book has many characters and is very long, over 800 pages. Eleanor wanted to make sure each character had a chance to tell their story.

I interviewed Eleanor when her book was very popular. She was still young and had just come from Germany. She told me a funny story about a time when someone asked her to prove she was a writer. She showed them her book and they asked what it was about.

Eleanor's book is special because it's not just a mystery story. It's also about the past and how people thought and felt a long time ago. She wanted to write a book that was fun to read and had a special structure. She didn't plan everything out beforehand, she just wrote and saw what happened.

Eleanor loves writing and talking about it. She likes to make her books fun for readers. She also likes TV shows and thinks it would be cool to write for TV.

Jonny Kinkead is a man who loves making things. As a boy, he liked to fix things in his dad's garage and play the guitar. He still loves building guitars today. Jonny learned to play the guitar when he was 11 years old. When he was 16, he wanted to learn the bass guitar. He didn't buy one, he made it himself. Jonny and his brothers used to build model boats and planes, so he knew how to use tools. He even fixed guitars for his friends.

Jonny's bass guitar turned out well, but he didn't think about making guitars for a living. He went to university to study architecture, but he didn't like it. He realized that building guitars is like sculpture, and he wanted to make things that people could use. So, he started making guitars for a living.

At first, Jonny sold his guitars for the same price as the materials he used. But as he became famous for making good guitars, he could charge more money. Now, Jonny makes only about 10 guitars a year, which is not a lot. He has to work hard to get known and price his guitars correctly. He thinks it's easier for new guitar-makers today because people know that UK-made guitars are good too.

Jonny says that you can learn good techniques in school, but you also need to try things and make mistakes. If you make something wrong, you can learn from it. If someone teaches you, you only learn one way, but if you teach yourself, you learn everything.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A1 learner:

When we talk about English conversations, we often start with the weather. This is because it's a common topic that people talk about when they meet each other. A long time ago, a man named Dr. Johnson said, ""When two English people meet, they first talk about the weather."" This is still true today.

Many people try to explain why English people like talking about the weather so much. Some people think it's because the weather is interesting. But actually, it's not about the weather at all. It's about using the weather as a way to talk to each other.

In England, people use the weather as a way to say hello, to start a conversation, or to fill a silence. It's like saying ""hello"" or ""how are you?"" to someone. It's a way to be friendly and polite. This is why some people think that English people talk about the weather all the time. But really, it's just a way to be social and talk to each other.

For example, when you meet someone, you might say ""Nice day, isn't it?"" or ""It's cold today, isn't it?"" These are not really questions about the weather. They are just a way to start a conversation or to be friendly. It's like a secret code that English people use to talk to each other.<|eot_id|>"

The students were very interested, but they wanted to know why the Romans built it. Alice couldn't find a good book to help her teach this, so she decided to write one herself.

Alice used to be a teacher, but she retired after 31 years. She started writing books for children because she wanted to help them learn and have fun at the same time. She likes writing because it's exciting and not as tiring as teaching. She says that teaching is like acting, and writing is like a new adventure.

Alice wants to write books that are not too scary or too fantastical. She wants to make sure children enjoy reading her books and learn something new. She loves teaching and writing because she gets to help children learn and grow.

Alice wrote her first book after taking a writing course. She was a bit nervous, but the other students on the course helped her and gave her good feedback.

The goal was to get to the highest road in Yorkshire. Jonny was excited because the roads were nice and warm in his car. Alistair was also excited, but he was wearing special clothes to keep warm because it was cold. He said he might stop for a cup of tea halfway. They started racing, and Alistair went fast up a big hill. Jonny had to drive carefully because there were obstacles on the road, like a big tractor. Alistair had to get off his bike and carry it up the hill. Finally, they reached the top of the hill, and Alistair started going fast again. Jonny had to drive slowly because the roads were narrow and wet. When they finished, Alistair got there first. Jonny was a little sad, but he said ""Well done"" to his brother.'

When I play tennis on the big court at Wimbledon, I feel a big silence. The grass is soft, and I can bounce the ball quietly. I serve and hit the ball, and I only hear my own shots. The grass is trimmed, the stadium is old, and the players wear white clothes. The crowd is quiet and respectful. This silence helps me focus on the game. 

When I'm playing, I try to forget everything else and just focus on the point I'm playing. But sometimes, the crowd cheers and claps when a point is finished. I hear it, but it sounds far away. 

I'm very focused, so I don't think about all the people watching me on TV. I just think about my opponent and the game. 

I always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My coach, my uncle Toni, told me it was the biggest tournament. When I was 14, I told my friends I would play there one day and win. 

Before 2008, I played and lost to Roger Federer twice. The first time, I was happy to be there, but the second time, I was very sad. I was 20 years old and felt like I had thrown away my chance. My coach didn't say much to comfort me, but he told me there would be more chances. 

I was very upset, but he was right. Another chance came, and here I was again in 2008. I was confident that I had learned from my mistake and would do better. I knew I would win. 

The night before the big match, we didn't talk about the game at dinner. I was already thinking about it in my head, and I wanted to keep it to myself until the next day.<|eot_id|>"

In 1963, a big organization in Britain made a TV show and articles about Jane's work with chimpanzees. She wrote books for children and adults, and people loved reading them. Jane is one of the most famous scientists of the 20th century, maybe even the most famous woman scientist.

But many people don't know what Jane really did. They think she was just a brave girl who loved animals. But Jane did something very important. She showed us that chimpanzees are smart and can do many things like humans. They can use tools, eat meat, and have feelings like humans do. Jane's work helped us understand chimpanzees and ourselves better.

Jane started her work when she was very young. When she was five years old, she went into a henhouse to see how hens lay eggs. She was very curious and wanted to learn. This might have been the start of her career as a scientist.'

Many people ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a job that people dream about when they are young, like being a racing driver. But most people give up on these dreams and choose more realistic jobs, like being a lawyer or working in a factory. It's hard to believe that you can make a living by drawing simple pictures, like those you find in school notebooks. But some people do it. 

I wanted to be a cartoonist when I was a child. I loved drawing and made pictures for my school newspaper. After I finished school, I studied graphic design and then showed my drawings to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted my cartoons. I started selling them and soon I could make a living from my drawings.

You don't need a lot to become a cartoonist. You don't need to go to university, you don't need a lot of money, and you don't even need to be a good artist. You just need your brain, your hands, and something to make marks. 

But being a cartoonist is not easy. It's a tough job. You need to be good at many things, like drawing, writing, and understanding people. I have done many different jobs, like drawing cartoons, comic strips, and books. I have also written, drawn caricatures, and designed things. 

It's important to be smart, read a lot, and be curious about the world. This helps you learn and grow as an artist. 

Some people are worried about someone stealing their ideas. But you can protect your work by putting a 'c' in a circle and writing your name and the date next to it. 

Remember, it's more likely that no one will want your work. But if someone does steal your idea and it becomes popular, it can be a good thing!<|eot_id|>"

Later, I felt sad about giving away my guitar. Then, I got an email from a man named Keith. He said he had my old guitar! He found it at a place where people throw away things. He looked at the name on the back and found me online. He wanted to sell it back to me.

I was so happy to get my guitar back! I had forgotten that my dad put his name and address on everything I owned, including my guitar. My parents wanted me to learn to play the classical guitar, but I didn't do well. I switched to the electric guitar and played simple songs.

Sleep is very important for our bodies and minds. When we don't sleep well, we can feel tired and grumpy. Some people have trouble sleeping and feel tired all the time. This is called insomnia.

When we sleep, we have dreams. Dreams are special because they help us think creatively. Creative thinking is important for our daily lives. We need to think creatively to solve problems and make new ideas.

Some people think that only artists, like writers and actors, need to think creatively. But everyone needs to think creatively. We all need to solve problems and make new ideas in our daily lives.

When we sleep, our brains work hard to help us think creatively. This is why we need to sleep well. When we have good sleep, we can think clearly and make good decisions.

For example, when I write, I often have good ideas after a good night's sleep. Even if I have a bad dream, it can help me think of new ideas. This is because our brains are working hard to help us think creatively while we sleep.

Many people don't like classical music. When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's not classical music they're listening to. Most people know many pop group names, but few know who Brahms was. I'm studying music, but my friends don't know much about classical music. If you don't know who wrote the music, you probably don't listen to it. Not many people buy classical music records. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music. This is a problem for people who love classical music.

Older people think that TV and video games are the reason why young people don't like classical music. But it's not true. The truth is that classical music is not interesting to most people, especially teenagers. I know some teenagers who like classical music, but they are rare. I'm a musician, but I don't like classical music very much. I like many types of music.

Classical music is hard to understand because it has many changes in pace and mood. We like to talk and think fast. Pop music is easy to listen to because it's simple. Classical music needs time and attention. Pop music has lyrics, and classical music doesn't. The way we listen to music has changed. We can find any music on the internet now. We don't often listen to classical music.

Some people say that schools are the problem because they don't teach classical music well. But many kids like playing classical music in school. They practice and rehearse.

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

I got out of bed and looked out the window. The river was still frozen, but there was a small crack in the ice. I could see the sandbags along the riverbank, which we put there to protect the buildings from flooding. My back hurt from lifting them yesterday. I worked with many people in the town to do this job. My grandfather didn't seem to care. I looked at the river and saw a boy on the other side. He was trying to stand on a thin piece of ice. I got dressed in my special suit for kayaking and went to get my life jacket. I put on my lucky chain, which my grandfather gave me from his adventure in South America. I like to read about his adventure in my diary. I went to the kitchen to get something to eat. 'Good morning,' I said to my mom. 'You're up early today. Be careful, okay?' I ate a banana and went downstairs. I saw my grandfather in the hallway. 'Where are you going?' he asked. 'I'm going kayaking,' I said. He didn't seem happy about it. My mom came and smiled at me. 'Don't worry about him, Rex. He's not himself right now.' I smiled back and went outside to the boathouse.

I made some changes to the text to make it easier for an A1 learner to understand:

* Simplified vocabulary: I replaced words like ""leapt"", ""glistened"", ""ribbon"", and ""ill-tempered"" with simpler words like ""got out"", ""shone"", ""strip"", and ""not happy"".
* Shortened sentences: I broke up long sentences into shorter ones to make them easier to follow.
* Removed complex phrases: I removed phrases like ""proving I was up to the task"" and ""with one hand still on the curtain"" to make the text more straightforward.
* Simplified the plot: I focused on the main events of the story, like the protagonist getting ready for kayaking and dealing with his grandfather's grumpiness, and removed some of the details that might be confusing for an A1 learner.<|eot_id|>"

Mum took Jess by the arm. 'Come with me,' she said. They went to the study. On the table, there was a painting. It was one of Grandpa's, but it was different from his other paintings. 'Do you know anything about this?' Mum asked. Jess shook her head. 'I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on something new.' Jess looked at the picture. There was a river in the picture, but it wasn't a real river. It was a fantasy river. The picture was strange and beautiful. There was no green on the riverbank, but the water looked nice. There were no animals, no birds, and no people in the picture. Jess felt drawn to the picture. Mum said, 'It has a name.' Jess saw the words 'River Boy' on the back of the picture. She didn't understand why it was called that. Mum said, 'It's strange that Grandpa gave it a name. He usually doesn't do that.' Jess looked at her mother. 'There is no boy in the picture.' Mum said, 'Yes, it's strange. Maybe he will add a boy later.' Jess didn't think so. Mum asked Grandpa about the picture, and he said that artists don't explain their pictures because each one has its own meaning. If they had to explain every picture, they would never finish their work. Mum said she was hoping Jess could help her understand the picture because Jess is like a muse for Grandpa. A muse is someone who helps an artist. Jess knew what that meant, but she didn't think she was a muse for Grandpa. She thought a muse was a goddess, not a person. She said, 'Grandpa doesn't need my help. He's been painting for a long time.'<|eot_id|>"

I woke up this morning and accidentally cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I didn't mean to do it, but it could have happened if I tripped over the bed with my dad's knife. I was trying to fit my new cabinet into a corner, but it didn't fit. The cabinet was given to me by my grandma. It's a small, cute cabinet with flowers and tiny doors. I keep my shells and stones in it. My bedroom is small and shaped like a triangle. I have a bed and a wardrobe, and that's it. I want to move to a bigger room when my sister goes to university, but for now, I like my little room. The problem is, it's hard to find a place for my cabinet. I thought about cutting a small hole in the carpet to make it fit. My dad says it's good to think outside the box, and that's what I did.

""The book 'The Borrowers' is about a family of tiny people who live in a house and take things from the big people who live there. When I was asked to make a TV show based on the book, I knew it would be hard to make it good. People who like the book have strong ideas about how it should be done. I used the pictures from the book to help me make it. The author wanted the show to be from the Borrowers' point of view, not from the point of view of the big people. This made filming more complicated. The biggest challenge was making everything look right. The Borrowers are very small, so we had to make sure the camera was far away from them. We also had to crawl on the floor to film the big people's surroundings from the Borrowers' point of view. We developed a special way to make the shadows look right. After the show was finished, a famous director called George Lucas asked me how I did it. We built a special set for the Borrowers' home under the floorboards. The actors had to carry big things like giant scissors and coins. It was funny! We had to stop filming sometimes because the actors were laughing too much. In one scene, the Borrowers go down a drain. The actors had to go down a tunnel with the water and they said it was very scary. I wanted to make sure the costumes were right. I made them out of heavy material so they looked like doll clothes. This made it hard for the actors to move around. The weather was very hot during filming, and the actors didn't thank me for the costumes. We had to film most of the scenes with the actors in front of a blue screen. It was hard for them to react to things that weren't there. I drew pictures of every scene to show the actors how it should look. It took me three months to do it. We had to work fast and make sure everything was right. In the end, I think the show was good and people liked it.""<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A1 learner:

Many American teenage girls are expected to be good at many things. They must be good students, have a part-time job, volunteer, and be good at sports or other activities. This is what it means to be an American teenager today. Teenagers can't just go to school and blend in. They must be good at everything. 

Some people think that teenagers are lazy, rude, and selfish. But this is not always true. Many teenagers work hard and have a lot of responsibilities. They have a lot of homework, tests, and activities outside of school. They also have to take care of their homes and families.

Some people think that teenagers spend all their time watching TV or playing with their phones. But this is not true. Teenagers use their phones to help them with their schoolwork and to stay in touch with their friends and family.

Teenagers have a lot of responsibilities and not much free time. They often have to wake up early and stay up late to finish their work. Many teenagers don't get enough sleep. They may even fall asleep in school sometimes.

Despite all their responsibilities, many teenagers like to help others. They volunteer and do good things in their communities. They want to make a positive difference in the world.

In the future, people may have a different idea of what it means to be a teenager. But for now, teenagers are working hard and making a difference.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text:

The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in a small town in the mountains in the United States. They like to launch balloons into the air to study the stars and the Earth's atmosphere. They have been doing this for a long time and have sent over 50 balloons into the air. 

One weekend, they are going to launch a balloon to see if they can catch a shooting star. A shooting star is when a small rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and makes a bright trail. The balloon has a special box attached to it with a camera, a tool to measure how high it is, and a thermometer to measure the temperature. There are also two special trackers on the outside to help them find the balloon later.

The balloon gets bigger and bigger as it goes up into the air, and the teenagers chant ""Five, four, three, two, one"" to count down the launch. They watch as the balloon disappears into the night sky. After the launch, some of the teenagers stay to look for shooting stars. They lie down on blankets and look up at the very clear sky. It's hard to believe they are so close to a big city with millions of people.

The next day, the students use the trackers to find the balloon and the special box. It takes them a long time to get there because the area is very remote. When they finally find the box, they are happy, even though they didn't see any shooting stars. They are happy to have had an adventure and to have learned more about the Earth and the stars.

Chloe Morgan didn't like science when she was younger. But when her brother was doing a project on dinosaurs, she helped him and read about some new discoveries. She was really interested! She met a professional palaeontologist named Matt Cornelius and he was kind and patient. Chloe was happy to learn more about dinosaurs.

People often think palaeontologists are weird or silly in movies and TV shows. But Chloe says that's not true. She does many different things, like digging up bones and studying them in a lab. She also writes about her findings. Sometimes she talks to the public about science and dinosaurs.

Chloe likes to explain science to young people because they might be interested in it. She thinks it's important to teach them about all kinds of science. She was happy to help with a TV documentary about dinosaurs because it showed them in a more realistic way.

When you're in a car with your family, you know you're not there yet, even when you ask ""Are we there yet?"" many times. When you finally get to your destination, it's not ""there"" anymore, it's ""here"". So, you should ask ""Are we here yet?"" instead. Moms and dads get tired of hearing ""Are we there yet?"" all the time.

Imagine being in the back seat, watching movies, listening to music, and playing with puzzles while looking out the window. Your mom or dad will help you with things like getting snacks and changing the music. But sometimes, someone in the car does something bad, like putting their foot on the other person's side of the seat. This can start a fight. The driver and mom or dad will tell the child to stay in their own seat and not touch others.

Sometimes, the car ride is calm, and you can read a book. But then you might feel a cold air on your arm. It's not because the window is open, but because your brother or sister is blowing on you. This makes you angry. Your parents have ways to make the car ride better. For example, they might say ""We're there!"" even when you're still on the highway. This makes everyone quiet for a while.

When you finally get to your destination, the grown-ups get out of the car and go away from the kids. So, if your mom or dad is still near, the answer to ""Are we there yet?"" is ""no, we're not there yet"".<|eot_id|>"

We stopped on the beach to look at the rock pools. They had many colorful fish I had never seen before. We took our time and didn't worry about the time. We had lunch and dinner together over a campfire. When we went to sleep on the boat, it felt like a stress-free life.

The coach there was very good, and I learned a lot. I missed my parents at first, but I got used to my new life. My English got better too. When I was 18, I became a professional basketball player. I was tall, but I wasn't strong enough. I had to work on that. My coach found a team for me, and I joined them. I'm happy I did.

I went to college to study Tourism. But I needed a part-time job to help pay for my studies. I decided to become a tour guide in my city, Chicago. I liked showing visitors around and learned a lot about my city. After finishing college, I decided to make tour guiding my full-time job. But I had to learn more things to get a special license. I had to know a lot about Chicago's history, buildings, and public transport. It was hard work, but I did it. Now, I'm a qualified tour guide.

As a tour guide, I need to be good at many things. I need to be funny and tell interesting stories. I also need to be able to solve problems, like if a place is closed or a route changes. Tourists want to have a good time, not hear about problems. I need to make sure they're happy, or they might write a bad review online. Good reviews help me get more customers. That's why I try to make my tours fun and stress-free. I put a lot of energy into my job, and my reviews are usually very good. People often recommend my tours to other visitors.<|eot_id|>"

My name is Ella. I'm 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand with my sister Josie. We went to help at an elephant sanctuary. We took care of sick and rescued elephants. We were a little worried because we didn't know the other helpers. They were all older than us. But we soon felt at ease. Our job was to bring food to the elephants. They eat a lot of grass and bananas. It was hard work, but it was worth it to see them happy. We also helped wash the elephants in the river. I had fun, even though I got wet. The best part of the day was when we took the elephants to the forest at night. We all stayed in the same house. Josie and I shared a room. The food was yummy and didn't have meat. After dinner, we talked and played games with the other helpers. Now we're back in the UK, Josie doesn't talk much about Thailand. But if someone asks, she says she loved it.

We also help businesses take pictures with flowers. Sometimes, we even decorate a big place like a castle for a wedding. It takes a lot of work, but I'm proud of what we do.

I wake up early, at 4 a.m., to go to the market to buy fresh flowers. My friends think I'm crazy, but I like my job. It's cold and dark, but I don't mind. The market is very nice, with flowers from all around the world. It's hard to choose which ones to buy, because they all smell so good! But I have to think about what other people want, not just what I like.

Sometimes, I have to talk to the people who sell the flowers about prices. It can be a little hard, but it's part of my job. Flowers are not cheap, so I try to get the best price I can. At the shop, we look at the orders and put the flowers in vases. Then, we make bunches of flowers and figure out how much they cost. Some customers are surprised at how much flowers cost, so I have to ask them to think about what they want. I like my job because I get to make the flowers look nice for the people who buy them.

He works for a company that helps take care of old buildings. We were a bit worried about moving, but it's been okay. Our apartment in the castle is nice and cozy. In the summer, many people visit the island and we have parties on the beach. In the winter, it's quieter and we only see our friends who live on the island.

Research is an important part of learning. It means asking questions and finding answers. We don't just learn things and repeat them. We make new knowledge by asking ""Why? How? What?"" and thinking about the answers.

Research is not just for experts. It's for everyone. We all do research in our daily lives. For example, we ask questions when we're planning a trip, fixing something, or buying something online.

In college and university, we learn to ask questions and find answers. We learn to think critically and not just believe what others tell us. We need to question what we read and hear, and think about it carefully.

It's important to be critical and not just accept what others say. We need to think about if what we're being told is true or not. We need to use our own brains and make our own decisions.

Cities are important places for thinking and learning. People have always gathered in cities to talk about important things. But cities can also be very busy and overwhelming. Scientists are now studying how cities affect our brains. They found that cities can make us think less clearly. This is because cities don't have nature, like trees and parks. Studies have shown that looking at nature can help us think better and feel better. This is because nature is calm and quiet, and it helps our brains rest.

In the past, most people lived in the countryside, but now most people live in cities. Cities are very different from nature. They are busy and crowded, and we have to pay attention to many things at once. This can be tiring for our brains. Natural places, like parks, can help our brains rest and think better.

Some people think that cities are not good for our brains, but they are also good for creativity. The crowded streets and many people in cities can help us come up with new ideas. This is why cities are important for art, science, and technology.

The key is to find a balance between the benefits of cities and the harm they can cause to our brains. We need to find ways to make cities more natural and calm, so we can think and feel better.<|eot_id|>"

Do we only think inside our heads? This might seem strange, but it's true. We think we know where our thoughts come from, but what about the things around us? 

For a long time, people have used stones, sticks, and other objects to help them think and solve problems. This is not just about using tools, but about how our minds work. 

When we use something, like a stick, it becomes a part of us. This is true for everyone, not just blind people. Our brains think of the stick as part of our body. 

Humans are very good at using new things to help us think and learn. This is why we make so many things, like tools and machines. 

I want to show that our minds are not just in our heads, but also in the things we make and use. This is called Material Engagement Theory (MET). It helps us understand how our minds work and how we use things to think and learn. 

For example, a blind person uses a stick to feel things. The stick helps them to understand the world. This shows that our minds are always changing and growing as we use new things.

Photography has changed the way we see the world. It's especially true in the United States, where photography became a big part of American culture. People use cameras to take pictures of everything and anything. This is because photography is a way to capture moments and memories. 

Photography is important because it helps us understand who we are and where we come from. People use cameras to show their families and friends what they look like. They also use cameras to share their feelings and thoughts. 

Photographs are special because they are real. They show us what really happened. But, photographs can also show us what someone wants us to see. This is because the person taking the picture can choose what to show and what to hide. 

Photography is a way to talk to people. It's like a universal language. But, understanding a photograph is not always easy. We need to know why the person took the picture and what they wanted to say. 

Many artists use photographs in their work. They make paintings, drawings, and other things with photographs. This is because photographs are important for art. They help us see things in a new way.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text:

William James, an American philosopher and doctor, said that psychology is the study of our thoughts and feelings. This is still a good way to understand psychology today. We all have thoughts and feelings, and we can study them in humans, animals, and even machines. But it's hard to understand how our minds work because it's personal and private. We can't see our own thoughts and feelings directly.

When we talk about psychology, we often make judgments based on our own experiences. But this can be wrong. That's why psychologists use special methods to figure out what's true and what's not. They study how people behave and try to understand what's going on inside their minds.

It's hard to study the mind because it's not like a machine that we can see and touch. Psychologists have to use observations and experiments to learn about the mind. They have to be careful and use scientific methods to make sure their findings are correct.

Psychology is like solving a puzzle. We have to find the right clues and put them together to understand how the mind works. It's not easy, but it's important. Psychology can help us understand ourselves and others better. It can also help us make new discoveries and solve problems.

In the past, psychologists used to try to understand the mind by thinking about their own thoughts and feelings. But this isn't a good way to learn about the mind. Today, psychologists prefer to study how people behave and use that information to make theories about the mind.

In a special place in Michigan, USA, there is a collection of products that nobody wanted to buy. It's called the Museum of Failed Products. The owner, Carol Sherry, thinks each product has a sad story about the people who made it. The museum is special because it's a successful business. Many companies don't keep their failed products. The museum's owner, Robert McMath, started collecting products in the 1960s. He wanted to have a big collection of things. But, he didn't think about how many products would fail. Now, the museum has many products that nobody wanted.

People might think that companies would keep their failed products, but they don't. The museum is a happy accident. Robert McMath just wanted to collect products, but he got a lot of failed ones. This might be because people are too optimistic. They think that if they work hard, everything will be okay. But, sometimes things don't go well.

A scientist named Tali Sharot says that our brains are made to think good things will happen. This might be why we're optimistic. But, does it really work? A psychologist named Gabriele Oettingen studied this. She found that thinking about how well things will go actually makes people less motivated to do things. People who think about how well they will do at work might do worse.

A psychologist named Carol Dweck says that our experiences of failure are because of what we believe about our abilities. Some people think that ability is natural, and some people think it comes from hard work. If you think ability is natural, you might be very upset when you fail. But, if you think it comes from hard work, you might see failure as a chance to learn and get better.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

Sports teams often do better when they play at home. But why is this? Many people think it's because they feel more comfortable and supported by their fans. However, scientists and people who make money from sports are not so sure. They want to know if this is still true. 

Some people think that players are more focused and work better together when they play at home. This is because they are used to playing together and know each other's moves. It's like a big team working together like a machine.

Other people think that players feel more confident and strong when they play at home. They feel like they are defending their home and want to win to protect it. This can make them play better.

Some scientists did an experiment to see if referees make different decisions when they hear a crowd cheering. They found that referees are less likely to make decisions against the home team when they hear the crowd cheering. This might be because the referees don't want to make the crowd angry.

Home advantage has changed over time. In the past, home teams won more often, but now they win less often. This might be because players travel more easily now and have better conditions at their away games.

The mystery is that home advantage is different for different sports. For example, basketball and football teams do better at home, but baseball teams don't. This might be because baseball is a more individual sport, and players don't work together as much.

There is another idea that players feel more aggressive and strong when they play at home. This is like a natural instinct to defend their home and territory.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

'Gary Player, a famous golfer, said ""The more I practise, the luckier I get."" But he didn't mean it literally. He was being ironic and meant that the more he practises, the better he gets. This idea is important in sports because it makes us think about whether people are born good at something or if they become good through practice.

Some people think that practice is more important than being naturally good at something. This idea comes from a psychologist named Anders Ericsson who said that with 10,000 hours of practice, anyone can become an expert. Many books have been written about this idea.

But some people think that this idea is not true. They think that there are other factors that make some people better at something than others. These factors could be things like their genes, their environment, or their determination.

The author of this book, Epstein, wants to find out why some people are better at some things than others. He looks at many different examples, like dog racing in Alaska, to understand this. He thinks that both nature (our genes) and nurture (our environment) are important. He also talks about how some people are naturally better at certain things because of their genes.

Epstein also looks at how people from different countries or genders are treated in sports. He asks questions like ""Why do we separate men and women in sports?"" This shows that sometimes the best questions are the most obvious ones.'

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

Many children in rich countries feel unhappy and lonely. A writer named Jay Griffiths thinks she knows why. She says that children are not spending enough time outside playing in nature. They are stuck inside playing with screens like TVs and computers. This is making them unhappy.

A study talked to some children to find out why they were unhappy. The children said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults also remember when they were young and had more freedom. They used to play outside all day, exploring and having fun. They think this is better than the way children are living now.

Griffiths writes that parents are worried about the dangers outside and keep their children inside. This is good for the toy and game companies, who make money from selling things to keep children entertained at home. She also talks about how some doctors prescribe medicine for children who are restless, and how some schools make rules that are too strict.

Griffiths thinks that children should be allowed to be free and explore the world around them. She says that children need to take risks to learn how to be safe. But she does not say how we can make sure children are safe when they take risks. Some people might not agree with Griffiths' ideas, and that's okay. Maybe the most important thing is to let children have their own choices and not force them all to be the same.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A1 learner:

I'm a scientist who studies how children learn and grow. I think that school is not the best way to learn many important things. Most problems in life cannot be solved with just what we learn in school. We need to use our own ideas and make good choices. Children learn by playing, just like all mammals do. When we are young, we play to learn and have fun. Children need to play a lot to learn important skills like being creative, getting along with others, and controlling their feelings. These skills are important for living a happy and successful life.

Creativity is very important. We need people who can think of new ideas and solve new problems. Playing is a way to develop creativity. Many famous people, like Albert Einstein, were very creative and played when they were young. They kept their creative minds by playing as adults too.

Children are born with a desire to play with others. This is how they learn to be kind and fair. Play is important because it is voluntary, which means children can choose to stop playing if they want to. This makes play a very democratic activity.

Unfortunately, school has become too serious. Children don't have enough free time to play. They are also forced to play with adults watching, which is not the same as playing with their friends. We need to give children more freedom to play and explore, so they can grow up to be strong and healthy adults.<|eot_id|>"

Many young people are using social media to find a job. They can contact employers directly on websites like Twitter and LinkedIn. But, with more opportunities comes more chance to make mistakes. A young job seeker in the US contacted a marketing executive on LinkedIn. The executive had many important people in her contact list, and the young job seeker thought she could help him find a job. But the executive was not happy about it. She rejected his request and sent a mean message. This made people online very upset.

This incident shows that social media can be a dangerous tool for job hunters who don't know how to use it. Many young people are using social media in a wrong way. They are used to using social media to talk to friends, not to find a job.

When we use social media to find a job, we need to be careful. We should introduce ourselves clearly and explain what we can do for the person we are contacting. We should not send impersonal emails and be humble in our messages. If we do this, we will have a better chance of getting a good response.

Newspapers are in trouble. Many people don't read them as much as they used to. Some people think newspapers will disappear in the next 15 years. But newspapers have survived many changes before. 

A long time ago, people thought books and theater would disappear because of newspapers. But theater didn't go away. Radio and TV came later, but theater is still popular. Even vinyl records came back in style. 

Newspapers were once new and exciting. It took a long time for them to become the main way to get news. This was because it was hard to make and deliver newspapers quickly and cheaply. 

People used to think that life was always the same, and they didn't need to know what was happening every day. But now we expect things to change. 

In the past, people didn't need news every day. They just knew what was happening in their village or town. Now, we can get news whenever we want. We can even get updates on our phones.

We have changed the night by adding light. This is called light pollution. It's like building a dam to control the river. But it has bad effects. It makes it hard for some animals to live. Some animals use the dark to find food, mate, or travel. When we add light, it confuses them.

A long time ago, cities were not as bright as they are now. People used candles, torches, and lanterns. It was hard to see the city from far away. Now, we have many lights in our cities. We have lit up the night like it's a new country. But it's not a new country. It's the night, and many animals live in it.

Some animals are attracted to light. They fly towards it. This can be bad for them. They can get hurt or lost. Some birds fly into tall buildings at night because of the bright lights. Some birds sing at the wrong times because of the light.

We need darkness. Darkness is important for our health. We need to sleep and wake up at the right times. If we don't, we can get sick. The light of the stars is important for us. It helps us know what time it is and how to live. We should remember that we are part of the world and the universe. We should respect the darkness and the animals that live in it.'<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A1 learner:

A big company has decided not to keep track of how much holiday time their employees take. The idea came from a company that already does this. The boss of the big company says that employees can take as much holiday as they want, as long as they are sure their work will not suffer. But is this a good idea?

The big company has many employees and many different jobs, so it's hard for them to know who is working on what and when. This means it's hard for employees to know if their work will be okay while they're on holiday. It's also hard for the company to know if an employee is taking too much holiday.

Some people might not take holiday at all if they're not sure if it's okay. This could make them feel stressed and unhappy. Others might feel guilty if they do take holiday, and this could also make them stressed.

In the past, people had to work late and this made it hard to take holiday. Now, with new technology, it's easy to work from anywhere and at any time. This means it's hard to separate work and leisure time.

The government has rules about how much holiday time employees should get. These rules are important because they help employees rest and have a good life. The unlimited holiday policy might not be good for employees' well-being.

I'm not sure if this policy will really help employees take more holiday or if it will just make things more complicated.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A1 learner:

Scientists share their research papers with other experts in the same field to make sure they are good quality. This helps to stop bad or silly papers from being published. But, this process can take a long time. Some scientists think this is okay because it's important to make sure the research is trustworthy.

However, some people think there are problems with this system. It's not always about the quality of the research, but about where it's published. The best journals are very popular, so scientists want to publish their work there. This can lead to some scientists doing bad science to get their papers published. 

There's another way to share research: preprints. These are early versions of papers that scientists can share online before they're published in a journal. This helps to get the research out quickly, so others can read it, comment on it, and build on it. 

Some scientists are worried that sharing preprints will let bad science out. But, this hasn't happened so far. Preprints can also help scientists who want to share their criticisms of other people's research. This is important because it helps to improve the quality of the research.

Sharing preprints can also make research more popular. When people can read and share research easily, it gets more attention and is more likely to be used by others. This is a good way to focus on the research itself, not just where it's published.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text for an A1 learner:

I ask my students what a poem is. They often say it's like a painting with words. But I don't like that answer. One day, I asked them to write about an object. They chose an oxygen mask! It's not a usual choice, but it helped us understand what a poem is. A poem is special. It can make people feel things, like a song or a picture. But it's not like those things. It's unique.

I used to think poetry was confusing and hard to understand. But now I see that it's special. It can make us think about things in a new way. When we read a poem, it's like finding a surprise. We might not always understand it, but it's interesting.

So, what is a poem? It's a special kind of writing. It's like a thing that someone makes. Poets are like artists who create things. But a poem is not like a machine or an animal. It's something unique. It can make us feel things and think about things in a new way.

A poem is different from other writing. It's like a surprise. It can be short or long, and it can be in a magazine or a book. Poems are special because they are not just for sale. They are for people to enjoy.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

I bought a metal detector after I got married. It was a big expense, but my wife was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first try. I've been using the detector for many years and have found many interesting things, like old coins and brooches. But the most exciting find was a golden loop that looked like the famous Great Torc from the British Museum. I took it home and showed it to my wife. We were both very excited. I had to give it to the authorities, but before I did, I took it to show a friend in hospital and even wore it in a plastic bag to keep it safe. The torc is now in the British Museum in London. We got a lot of money from it, but it's not just about the money. It's about sharing something special with everyone.

I still enjoy using my metal detector and finding new things. Just like a fisherman who catches a big fish, I want to keep searching for more exciting finds.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

I like sleeping when I travel. But I don't talk about it much because I feel a little guilty. When my friends tell me about their trips, they always have a lot of plans and activities. But my trips are different. I like to sleep a lot, especially in the afternoon or morning. This is because sleep is an important part of traveling.

When I was in Mexico, I slept a lot. I was in a new place and it was noisy, but I didn't care. I could sleep deeply and have nice dreams. When I'm traveling, I don't have to wake up early or do things I don't want to do. I can sleep whenever I want.

I think sleep is special when I travel because it helps me relax and feel more comfortable. It's like my body is saying, ""Ah, I'm in a new place, and I'm going to enjoy it."" When I sleep, I can think about all the new things I've seen and experienced. It's like my brain is processing everything.

Sometimes, I have trouble sleeping when I'm in a new place because it's different from what I'm used to. But when I finally fall asleep, I feel like I've really arrived. I remember one time in the Dominican Republic when I took a big nap with my friends. We were all tired from eating and the sun was hot. We lay down on hammocks and pillows and slept. It was a nice experience.

Travel sleep is special because it's sleep I remember. When I'm in a new place, I notice new smells, sounds, and feelings. These things fill my brain and make my sleep more interesting. Maybe I should tell my friends that sleeping is an important part of traveling. It's not just something I do because I'm tired. It's a way for me to enjoy my travels.<|eot_id|>"

Lawrence Okoye is a 21-year-old from London. He has gone from throwing the discus to playing American football. He is very good at both sports. Lawrence was good at rugby too. He even went to a university to study law, but he decided to focus on throwing the discus instead.

Lawrence went to Atlanta, USA, to train for the discus. He wanted to be ready for the world championships. But then he heard about a chance to play American football. He decided to give it a try.

Lawrence had never played American football before, but he was chosen to try out for a big team. He was very good at it. He thinks he will be chosen for the team. But he is not sure. He is calm about it.

Lawrence used to be very good at throwing the discus. He was the fourth best in the world. He even went to the Olympics. He did not do as well as he wanted, but he is happy he qualified.

Some people think Lawrence should focus on one sport. But Lawrence wants to try American football too. If it does not work out, he can always go back to throwing the discus. He likes both sports.

I woke up on the plane and saw that it was already daytime. I looked out the window and saw a big, empty landscape with brown and green colors. It was September, but it didn't feel like autumn yet. I didn't see any people, just mountains, rivers, and forests going on forever. I shook my head. My neighbor, Sergei, woke up and smiled at me. He was a salesman from Moscow who was going to sell special clothes to miners in a faraway place. He didn't speak much English, but I explained to him that I was going to a city in Siberia called Magadan, but I didn't have a return ticket. I wanted to ride my bike back to England. Sergei said, ""But there's no road from Magadan. You can't ride a bike."" I told him that I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. ""Alone?"" he asked. ""No, I'll be with my friend Al."" He looked surprised. I told him I had warm clothes, but didn't mention that I was on a tight budget. I bought them cheaply, but I wasn't sure if they would be good enough.

It all started in a classroom in Scotland. I was thinking about a problem. Should I ask my teacher or not? I wrote a note to Al, my old friend, asking if he wanted to ride a bike across a big road between Pakistan and China. He said yes. Six years later, I was going to meet Al in Siberia.

I was a teacher, but I still had a hard time controlling my students. The job was challenging, but I liked it. I had long holidays to go on adventures. I went to visit Al twice before. He loved adventure and decided to ride his bike around the world. He was very brave and did many hard things. He was showing everyone that he could do it, even when it seemed impossible.<|eot_id|>"

The Red Bull Air Race is a competition where pilots fly their planes very fast and do tricks. I got to try it! Before I flew, I had to sign two papers. One said I was healthy, and the other said I would take out my phone and other small things from my pockets because they could get lost or cause problems during the flight.

I also learned to stay calm and look at the horizon to know which way I was going. The pilot told me to relax when I was upside down and look at the view. I was also told not to touch anything in the plane.

When we were on the runway, I was a bit scared. The pilot, Dario, and I got into the plane, the Zivko Edge 540. It's a very fast plane! We took off and went up, down, and all around. It was very fast and a bit scary. I had to hold on tight and look at the horizon to stay calm.

I got to fly the plane for a little while, but it was hard because it was shaking a lot. Then Dario did some tricks, like a barrel roll and a loop. I was a bit scared, but I tried to relax and look at the view. After the flight, Dario and I got out of the plane, and he ate a sandwich. I didn't eat for a long time after that.

Doug Allan films animals in cold places. He is very good at it. He loves the cold. His favorite temperature is -18°C.

Doug used to be a marine biologist and a commercial diver. He learned about surviving in cold places while diving. One day, a TV crew came to where he was working in Antarctica. They were making a documentary about wild animals. Doug showed them around and decided to become a wildlife cameraman. He liked traveling, adventure, and being underwater.

Now, Doug is a famous cameraman. He has worked on many big TV shows about animals. When he started, not many people had been to Antarctica. He was the only one who knew about filming in the cold. He liked being the ""cold man"".

When Doug started filming, cameras and communication equipment were not very good. He had to remember everything he filmed. Now, with digital cameras, he can film a lot and look at it right away. He can shoot more footage and don't have to worry about running out of film.

Doug has a lot of experience filming in cold places. He knows how to stay warm and healthy. He has filmed in places with no mosquitoes, no diseases, and no leeches.

Filming wild animals can be very successful, but it can also be difficult and embarrassing. One time, Doug got confused about what kind of birds he was filming. Recently, he went to a place in the Arctic to film polar bears. It was very cold and snowy. He walked for hours every day and waited for polar bears to appear. After 23 days, he finally saw a mother bear and her cub. On the 24th day, he felt like he was living with the bears.

This time, he will walk 1,000 kilometers with two friends to take measurements of the ice. No one has done this before. He wants to help scientists understand how the ice is melting because of global warming.

Pen grew up with a love for adventure. When he was a child, his father's old nanny took him on long walks in the mountains in the snow. Pen's father loved adventure too. Pen's wife, Mary, is also brave and loves the outdoors. She helps Pen with his work and is worried about him when he's away.

Pen has two children, and it's hard for him to be away from them. Last time, he said goodbye to them and told his son to take care of his mother and sister. But it was hard for his son to do that. This time, Pen will try to stay in touch with them less often.

Pen is going on this trip with two friends and a team of six people who will bring them food and supplies. He's a little worried because he's not as fit as he used to be. He wants to make sure he can do this trip well.

Choosing which dishes to put in the book was hard. I knew some people would be upset if I didn't include their favorite dishes. But we worked together to make a list that everyone could like.

I realized that everyone has their own idea of what is perfect. It's a mix of emotions, memories, and surroundings. My book is not saying that these are the only perfect recipes. It's just showing how I made them and what makes them special.

I went on many adventures to find the best ingredients and people. I visited a factory that made the wrong kind of tomatoes and a farm that wasn't perfect. I even had to milk a cow and make ice cream with dry ice! I tried different ways to cook chicken and pizza to get them just right.""

'My dad says I should not spend too much time online. But I wanted to know what experts say. They think that many teenagers who use social media have many friends, a good sense of who they are, and learn important computer skills. Simon Miles says that social media is a normal part of growing up. Teenagers don't just use it to check emails like grown-ups do, they live online. It's not good or bad, it's what you do with it that matters.

Jim Matthews says that social media is like a virtual youth club where teenagers can share jokes and gossip with their friends. It helps them figure out who they are and how to deal with problems. A psychologist, Professor Keith Davidson, says that social media can help teenagers find their identity by sharing their interests and seeing what others think.

Some people think that social media can help shy people make friends because it's easier to talk online than in person. Professor Andrew Phillips says that social media can connect people with similar interests, like music or sports.

Pauline White, an expert on digital education, says that social media can be creative. Teenagers can make videos, podcasts, and write blogs about things they like. They can also share photos and learn from each other. This can help them when they grow up and find a job. Many businesses use social media to sell things and make people know about their brand.

I met Charlotte in an office where she was talking to her publishers. I was surprised to see a 15-year-old girl sitting there. Her book is very good. It's like a big adventure story. You wouldn't know it was written by a teenager.

Charlotte is a smart and strong person. She knows that she's young and can't know everything. She just wanted to write about something important: taking responsibility. She thinks some books about teenagers are not good because they show teenagers as not being good enough or not knowing what they want. Charlotte wanted to write about someone who is okay and can make good choices.

Charlotte likes to read books, but some books by famous authors made her feel like she couldn't write a good book. But she liked a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which told her to make the story interesting so the reader doesn't know what will happen next.

I was afraid to go fast, but I kept trying. On the second day, we practiced on the trampolines again. Gareth gave us tips and we did some exercises to help us feel more comfortable in the air. We went back to the mountain and tried again. It was hard, but I finally landed properly. I was very proud of myself. But then, on the last run of the day, I went too fast and my skis flew off my feet.

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster in an amusement park. You're a little scared, but you're excited too. The rollercoaster stops and then goes up slowly. Then it drops down quickly and you feel like you're flying. You might scream a little because it's so fun! But you know you're safe because you're in a special seat.

Rollercoasters are very popular. Many people love them. But did you know that there are many experts who work hard to make sure the rollercoasters are safe and fun? They are engineers, designers, and marketing experts. They make sure the rollercoaster is exciting but not too scary.

One of the most important things is to make sure the rollercoaster is safe. The engineers have to be very careful when they design the ride. They have to make sure it's not too fast or too slow. They also have to make sure it's not too high or too low. It's a big job!

The designers have to think about what kind of story they want to tell with the rollercoaster. They want to make it exciting and fun. They might make it look like a space adventure or a jungle adventure. They have to make sure everything works together to make the ride fun.

The experts also have to test the ride before it opens to the public. They want to make sure it's safe and fun. They might even be thrill-seekers themselves! They know what makes a ride exciting and they want to make sure the riders have a good time.

Some people might think that new technology like virtual reality will change the way rollercoasters work. But one of the experts said that the physical coaster experience will always be the best. People will always love the feeling of being on a rollercoaster.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

Miranda Ellington is a 25-year-old choreographer. She makes dance shows for many theaters and dance companies. She also likes to dance sometimes. I don't understand why she does both. She says being a dancer again reminds her of when she was a student and had to follow the choreographer's orders. It can be frustrating.

As a choreographer, Miranda teaches young dancers. She likes working with them because they are open to new ideas and willing to try new things. They are eager to learn and don't know what they are good at or bad at yet. This makes it easier for Miranda to teach them.

When Miranda starts working on a new dance show, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. She tries to find a good way to match the dance with the music. Sometimes the music is not her favorite, but she still tries to make the dance good. If the dancers don't like the music, she tries to find a way to make it work.

Miranda doesn't like to work for one company all the time. She likes to work with different people and try new things. This means she has to adapt to each new place she works. She doesn't want to do the same thing all the time.

We talked about a TV show about ballet dancers. Miranda said it showed what it's really like to be a dancer. She said it's hard work and takes a lot of dedication. People don't always understand how hard it is.

I asked Miranda what makes a good dance show. She said it's when everything comes together - the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. It's like a big puzzle. If one part is missing, it can be disappointing.

Miranda has done many different types of dance shows. She doesn't want to be known as just a ballet or modern dance choreographer. She wants to try new things and work with different people.<|eot_id|>"

I have a friend who asked me why I like to travel when I can watch everything on TV. I said that yes, you can see many amazing things on TV, but why stay at home when there is so much to see and experience? This conversation made me think about my big adventure. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, and I thought it would be a great idea to take it with me on a trip. I fixed the wheels and cables and wore the seatbelts on my shoulders. I put my bag on the seats and slept on the sofa each night. Some friends joined me and helped me pull the sofa along. I walked on the road and stopped at cafes to rest and have a coffee. People would ask me, ""Why are you doing this?"" and I would say, ""I'm not doing it for charity, I'm not training for a marathon. I'm just doing something different."" Now, when people ask me about my weekend, I like to tell them about my adventure instead of talking about TV shows.

I made a film about my trip and you can see it on my website.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

'I saw an ad about swimming trips in the sea around small Greek islands. I was excited because I never did group trips before. My brother was busy, so I thought a group holiday would be fun. At the port, I asked for a ticket for one person. The man looked surprised because families usually go to these islands. I told him I would be with a group of ten people. He smiled and showed me to the boat. We had talked to each other on the internet before we left, but we didn't have time to talk much before our first swim. Our guides told us there would be a boat with us the whole time and showed us how to talk to it. We did a short swim to get into groups. Then we did a longer swim, 1.5 kilometers. I was a little scared because I never swam that far in the sea before. The waves got bigger and I was at the back of the slow group. I saw faster swimmers and wanted to keep up. I was happy when I finished the swim. The next days were similar: we jumped in, swam at a good speed, and stopped to look at the nice views. As we swam farther, I got faster and happier. I didn't need the support boat much. I want to go back next year!'<|eot_id|>"

I like being a flight attendant. I have been to many countries, like the US and Australia. I work with nice people and have a lot of free time. It's a great job for young people like me! When I was a child, I went to a boarding school far from my family. I had to fly alone sometimes, so I helped the flight attendants serve food to passengers. This made me happy. Later, I was unhappy with my old job in banking. I wanted a new job, so I looked for a new career. Many young people applied for the job, and some were accepted. We all had good qualifications and wanted to change jobs. Before the interview, I practiced what to say. I told them about my strengths and my previous work experience. I got the job! I like my new job very much. It's a good job because I get to see many places, I have friends who work with me, and I don't have to work too much. Sometimes, I have to deal with difficult passengers, but that doesn't happen often.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text:

I work at a summer camp where I see happy children learn new things. Many kids already know how to swim and play table tennis, but rock climbing is new for most of them. Some kids are scared at first, but with encouragement, they try and succeed! It makes them feel proud. Sometimes, older kids (10-13 years old) miss their homes at first. We don't let them use their phones all the time. We tell them they can call home after lunch, and later, we say it's too late to call now, try again tomorrow. Most kids are okay after a few days, and at the end of the week, they thank us for having a great time. Sometimes, parents call us too much, asking about their child. We tell them to call back later, as their child might be busy playing or doing something else. We also get kids who wear new, expensive clothes. They might argue when we ask them to change, but they understand why soon.

Note: I kept the main ideas and events of the original text, but simplified the language to make it more accessible to an A1 learner. I used shorter sentences, basic vocabulary, and avoided complex structures.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for an A1 learner:

'Rock the Planet is a musical show where actors are also musicians. It opened in London last year after being in the USA for five years. The show was very popular in the USA and won four awards! But it was hard to find actors in the UK because they can't do as many shows as actors in the USA. The director found many talented UK actors and they won their first award. The theatre in London is bigger than the one in the USA, but it's always full. People want to hear the songs that were popular in America.

I met Jamie, an 11-year-old actor in the show. He's very happy to play his guitar and earn money. He goes to school every day at the theatre and misses his old friends. His whole class came to see the show and they loved it! Jamie's parents come to see him sometimes, but it's expensive.

Jamie and his friends are very good at music, but they didn't play in a band before. They found it easy to learn, but they were a bit nervous at first. They forgot to smile when they first performed! The show will be in London for another year, and it's worth seeing.'

I made the following changes to simplify the text:

* Shortened sentences and paragraphs to make it easier to follow
* Removed complex vocabulary and phrases, such as ""all-British cast"", ""voted 'Best Musical' four times"", ""normal school lessons"", ""special deals on tickets for schools"", and ""appeared natural when they first performed together""
* Simplified sentence structures and grammar, such as using simple present tense instead of past perfect tense
* Removed idiomatic expressions, such as ""it's been full every night"" and ""I was just trying to keep up""
* Focused on the main ideas and events, and removed some details that are not essential to the story.<|eot_id|>"
