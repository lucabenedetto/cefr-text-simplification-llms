Some time ago, a website warned people about sharing their whereabouts online. The website said that when you post where you are, you are also telling many people you don't know. This is a problem because not everyone you tell is someone you want to meet. This shows that sharing things online can have negative effects.
In the past, some people were the first to share their lives online. They wrote about their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. They shared photos and stories. These pioneers of the internet went through many problems, like losing friends and getting into trouble. They did this before social media was invented.
Before we follow in their footsteps, we should learn from their experiences. In 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started writing about his life online. He shared photos and stories about himself. He even shared his daily life on his blog. Many people read his blog because it was interesting and unique.
One day, Justin's blog disappeared, and he was very upset. He had shared his personal life online, and it caused problems. He had to stop writing about his life online. This shows that sharing too much online can have negative consequences.
Another example is Heather Armstrong, a young woman who wrote a blog called Dooce. She wrote about her job and her life. But one day, an anonymous colleague sent her blog address to her bosses, and she lost her job. This is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they wouldn't say in person. But the internet is not a separate reality where we can be anonymous. Our online and offline lives are connected.
Heather Armstrong learned a valuable lesson. She realized that she shouldn't share too much online. She stopped writing about her life for a while, but then started again, focusing on her family. Today, she is a successful blogger and writer.
The lesson is that while the internet allows us to share anything, it's not always a good idea to do so. We should be careful about what we share online."

Some scientists were worried about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? It showed that we don't know a lot about the universe. Scientists can be a bit arrogant, but even they wouldn't claim to know everything. Some scientists thought the film was very important and warned people about it. The film said that scientists have made some amazing discoveries. One of these discoveries is that water can be affected by our thoughts. This is a big claim, but some people find it hard to believe because there isn't enough proof.
The film showed some pictures of ice crystals that looked different depending on the person who was talking to them. Some people thought this was amazing, but scientists said it wasn't enough evidence. They wanted more proof. The film also said that there are forces in the universe that we don't understand. This is true. Scientists have found out that the universe is made of a special kind of matter that we can't see, and it's being pushed by a force called ""dark energy"". This is a big mystery.
Scientists have also made other amazing discoveries. They found out that our brains work in a way that we don't realize. They also found out where humans came from and how they spread around the world. Some scientists think that the existence of life on Earth is connected to the design of the universe. This is a big idea.
The truth is that science is still learning and we don't know everything. We can't know everything because of the laws of chaos and quantum uncertainty. Some scientists are trying to create a theory that explains everything in one equation. Many people think that the universe is amazing and incredible."

I enjoy writing short stories more than novels. Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is like planting a garden. Both processes help me create a complete world that I love. When I finish a novel, I like to write some short stories. After finishing a group of short stories, I feel like focusing on a novel again. I never write short stories while writing a novel, and never write a novel while writing short stories. Writing novels and short stories use different parts of my brain, so it takes time to switch between the two.
I started writing short stories in 1984. At first, it was difficult because I didn't know much about short-story writing. But I learned a lot and found it very enjoyable. My readers appreciated my short stories and saw a new side of me as a writer.
One of the best things about writing short stories is that they don't take as long to finish. It usually takes me a week to write a short story, and then I can move on to something else. Writing novels can take months or even years, which can be overwhelming. Writing short stories is a nice change of pace for me.
I also like that short stories can be about small things, like an idea or a word. It's like improvising jazz, and the story can take me anywhere. If an idea doesn't work out, I don't worry about it. Even famous writers like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Raymond Carver didn't always write great short stories. I learn from my mistakes and use them to improve my next story.
For me, short stories are like a laboratory where I can experiment and try new things. Without short stories, writing novels would be even more difficult. My short stories are like footprints I leave behind, and I remember exactly where I wrote each one and how I felt. They are like guideposts to my heart, and I'm happy to share them with my readers."

Here is a simplified version of the passage at the B1 level:
Science is a way of understanding the world. It can be very abstract or very practical. Sometimes it helps us, and sometimes it makes our lives more complicated. Scientists try to understand big questions like how the universe began and how everything works. They also try to solve problems like curing diseases. But science is not perfect. It has its own rules and limitations.
Throughout history, scientists have disagreed with each other. They have changed their ideas many times. Sometimes, new ideas are accepted quickly, and sometimes they take a long time. Scientists come from different backgrounds and have different personalities. They can be jealous or angry when they disagree.
This book is about the ideas that have changed science and how it has changed the way we think. We will look at these ideas and think about their beauty and importance. We will also consider the limitations of human understanding. Science is always changing, and sometimes it makes big changes to our understanding of the world.
In the past, scientists thought they knew everything. But then they discovered new things like radioactivity and the electron. Today, scientists are still discovering new things and changing our understanding of the world. Science is important because it helps us understand and control the world. We need to be careful with science because it can affect our future and the future of our children.

From around 2015, some big book publishers started to say that the number of ebooks they were selling was not growing as fast as it used to. In fact, some were even selling fewer ebooks than before. This made people wonder if ebooks would really replace printed books. One person in the publishing industry said that the excitement about ebooks might have led to some bad investments, and their company was no longer sure about the future of ebooks.
Even though it's clear that ebooks and printed books can coexist, people still talk about whether ebooks will ""kill"" printed books. This idea is interesting because it shows how people feel about change and new technology. When new technologies come out, people often worry that they will replace what we already have. This has happened many times before. For example, when TV was invented, some people thought radio would disappear. But radio didn't go away - it just found new ways to be used.
The idea of one medium replacing another is not new. As early as 1894, people thought that the phonograph would replace books. But books didn't disappear. Instead, people started listening to audiobooks. This has happened many times before. Movies, radio, TV, and even smartphones have all been thought to replace printed books, but they didn't.
When new technologies come out, people often feel a mix of emotions. They might be excited about the new technology, but they also might miss the old one. This is because we form strong connections with the things we use every day. We might even give names to our cars or computers, or get upset when they don't work properly.
When a new technology comes out, we have to adjust to a new way of doing things. This can make us nostalgic for what we used to have. That's why we often see a new appreciation for old things when a new technology comes out. For example, when e-readers became popular, people started to appreciate the feel and smell of printed books again.
So, even though some people might worry about the future of printed books, the idea of one medium replacing another will continue to be a popular topic. It's a way for us to talk about the power of technology and our fear of change."

I wrote a book about how famous people from the past 400 years spent their daily time. I wanted to know how they managed to be creative and productive. I looked at what they ate, when they slept, and how they worked. I thought this could help us understand their personalities and careers better.
The book is not just about what they did, but also about how they did it. It's about their daily routines and habits. I wanted to show how these routines helped them be creative and successful. I also wanted to answer some questions I have about my own life. How do I balance my creative work with my daily tasks? Can I do more in less time?
I didn't try to answer all these questions in the book, but I shared examples of how successful people have dealt with similar challenges. I looked at how they organized their time, what they did each day, and how it affected their work. I wanted to show how even small daily habits can make a big difference.
The book's title is ""Daily Rituals"", but I really focused on people's routines. A routine can be ordinary, but it can also be a way to make the most of your time and energy. A good routine can help you stay focused and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
I was inspired to write this book because I was procrastinating one Sunday afternoon. I was supposed to write an article, but instead, I was tidying my office and making coffee. I started searching the internet for information about writers' daily routines and found it really interesting. That's how I started the Daily Routines blog and eventually wrote this book.
I gathered information from many sources, including biographies, articles, and interviews. I tried to keep the book short and varied, with quotes from the people I wrote about. I also listed all my sources at the end of the book, so readers can learn more."

Howard became interested in palaeontology when he was six years old. His family couldn't afford a holiday in Spain, so they went to the English coast instead. On the beach, Howard found an ammonite, a fossilized shell. This sparked his passion for palaeontology. He wanted to study the ancient creatures that lived millions of years ago.
At university, Howard decided he wanted to focus on the earliest fossils. He didn't like the big, famous ones like dinosaurs. Instead, he was fascinated by the small, delicate creatures that lived a long time ago. After completing his thesis, Howard worried about finding a job. He applied for a position at Tavistock College in London, but wasn't sure if he would get it.
The day of the interview, the professor who was supposed to chair the panel had a fight with his wife and didn't show up. Another professor, who didn't like Howard, took his place. Despite this, Howard got the job. He was surprised, but happy to have a job that allowed him to do the work he loved.
Howard often thought about how his professional life was organized and planned, but his personal life was not. He found that some people could greatly affect his life, and sometimes things didn't go as planned. For example, his briefcase was stolen at the Underground, and he had to cancel a lecture. But then he met a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi, and they discussed a new project that could change his career.
Howard was so excited about the project that he changed his plans and decided to visit the museum in Nairobi. He cancelled his trip to Stockholm and his field trip to Scotland. He wanted to make sure he got to work on the project."

Professor Charles Spence is a food scientist who loves trying new foods. He even eats bee larvae ice cream! He is a professor at Oxford University and his work helps the food industry. He studies how our senses work together to create the taste and smell of food. For example, did you know that the person who orders first in a restaurant likes their food the most? And that we eat more when we're with friends?
Professor Spence's lab is not high-tech, but he can still do important research. He works with cooks and food companies to make food better. He helps them reduce salt and sugar in their products, so people can eat healthier. He also works with famous chefs, like Heston Blumenthal, to create new and interesting dishes. For example, they made a dish called ""The Sound of the Sea"" that used sounds to enhance the flavor.
Professor Spence has found that music can affect how we taste food. He says that high-pitched music makes food taste sweeter and low-pitched music makes it taste bitter. He is working with an airline to match music with food, and a company released a smartphone app that played music while you ate ice cream. He also has fun experiments at home, like eating rabbit with the fur wrapped around the cutlery!

Our brains are very busy today. We have a lot of information coming at us from different sources, and we need to sort through it all to find what we need. At the same time, we're doing more things on our own, like booking our own flights and buying things online. We're trying to do many things at once, but our brains are not good at this. We think we're multitasking, but really we're just switching between tasks quickly. This can make us feel stressed and confused.
Research shows that when we multitask, we're not actually doing many things at once. Instead, we're jumping between tasks quickly, which can make us less efficient. Multitasking can also make us feel anxious and confused, and it can even make us make bad decisions.
Our brains are also easily distracted, especially by new and exciting things. This can make it hard for us to focus on one task at a time. In fact, having too many things to do at once can make our brains work less well than when we're focused on one thing.
Many people feel overwhelmed by the amount of email they receive. They feel like they need to answer every email, but it's hard to do this and get anything else done. This can be frustrating and stressful.

In a zoo in Sweden, a chimpanzee named Santino liked to break concrete into pieces and throw it at visitors. Was he being mean? In caves in the US, female bats help other bats that are having trouble having babies. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, people thought animals just acted on instinct and didn't have feelings or thoughts. But now, scientists are studying animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens to see if they have emotions.
This new research has led to a debate: do animals have consciousness? This is a big question that may never be answered. It also raises another question: do animals have a moral sense, like humans do? 
Recently, scientists did an experiment with cows. They had to figure out how to open a gate to get food. The cows that opened the gate themselves seemed to enjoy it more than those that had someone else open it for them. If cows enjoy problem-solving, what does this mean for eating beef?
Some scientists think that if animals can solve problems, we should stop eating them. Others think we should just learn more about animal thinking. There is no clear answer. The problem is not just scientific, but also philosophical. We can't even define what consciousness is, so how can we know what it's like to be an animal?
A scientist named Jonathan Balcombe did an experiment with starlings. He put some in big cages with lots of space and water, and others in small cages with no space or water. The starlings in the big cages were happier and ate more, even when they got bad food. Balcombe thinks this means that being in a bad environment can make animals sad and pessimistic.
Some people think that animals should be treated with respect and kindness, just like humans. Others think that we should just focus on learning more about animals and not make assumptions. The debate will continue, but it's an important one."

Here is a simplified version of the passage, suitable for a B1 level learner:
Many people believe that technology is changing the way we think. Adrian West, a researcher, thinks that technology can make it harder for us to think deeply about things. He says that we are exposed to a lot of information, but it's not always good information. It's easy to get overwhelmed and not think critically.
In the past, people used to read a lot, but now they are reading less. This might be because they are spending more time looking at screens. Patricia Greenfield, a professor, thinks that this could be a problem. She says that reading helps us think critically, but visual media like video games and TV don't.
However, not all technology is the same. Some video games can actually help us think better. James Paul Gee, a professor, says that video games can be a good way to learn and can even help us become smarter. These games can teach us how to make decisions and think analytically.
It's clear that technology is changing the way we think, and we need to understand how it's affecting us. We need to be careful about the kind of technology we use and make sure it's helping us think critically, not just passively consuming information.

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic and a writer. He used to work in an office, but he didn't like it. He has written two books about how to live a good life. His latest book is about how we can't focus on what's important because of all the distractions around us.
He was inspired to write this book when he was shopping and saw ads on the credit card machine. He realized that we're constantly being asked to pay attention to things we don't want to think about. This makes it hard for us to decide what's important to us.
We're all being affected by this. We're getting better at ignoring things that annoy us, like people who interrupt us. But this means we're also not talking to strangers as much as we used to. Crawford thinks this is a problem.
He's not the only one who is worried. Many people are complaining about how hard it is to focus because of their phones and computers. There's no proof that our attention spans are getting shorter, but it's clear that we're more aware of distractions than we used to be.
Crawford thinks that technology is making it easy for us to avoid talking to people and that this is a problem. He gives the example of a gym where people used to listen to music together, but now everyone listens to their own music on headphones.
Crawford has two solutions. First, we need to make public spaces quieter and less distracting. Second, we need to find ways to engage with the world in a more meaningful way. He thinks that doing things that require skill and attention, like cooking or playing sports, can help us focus and make us happier.
He's not saying that everyone should become a chef or athlete. He just thinks it's important to find ways to use our judgment and pay attention to what's important. When we do this, we're better able to focus on what matters and connect with other people."

'What do you do for a living?' is a common question we ask each other. But when someone says they are a philosopher, it can be tricky to answer. People often think that philosophers are special or know more than others. This is not true. Philosophers are just people who think deeply about life and the world.
Philosophers have a reputation for being wise and knowing the answers. This comes from ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle, who thought that a life of thinking was the best life. Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that we should think about our lives and question what we believe. This helps us make our own decisions and be in control.
However, many people think that philosophers are too focused on books and not connected to real life. This is because academic philosophy has become more about writing papers for other experts than talking to the public. Philosophers need to share their ideas with everyone, not just other experts.
I am a philosopher and my work is mostly about ethics, which is the study of what is right and wrong. But I think there is more to philosophy than just deciding what is ethical. Philosophy can help us think about our daily lives and the choices we make. It can help us understand why we do things and whether they are good or bad.
Philosophy is not just for experts or academics. It's for anyone who wants to think deeply about life and make their own decisions. By examining our ideas and beliefs, we can learn more about ourselves and the world around us.'"

Food and eating are important topics that can bring people together. Philosophers, however, have not always talked about food in a serious way. Instead, they have used food as a metaphor for other ideas. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus believed in the pursuit of pleasure and avoiding pain, but he didn't just talk about eating. Surprisingly, his name is often associated with a love of food and drink, and even restaurants and food shops use it in their names.
Food is a social and cultural thing. We don't just eat alone, we eat with others. This is important because food comes from our communities and is shared with others. Food critics, who write about food, have a special job. They are good at describing how food tastes, but this is not a special skill. Anyone can taste food and describe it.
Food is also about aesthetics, or beauty. Some people think that food can be beautiful, like art or music. However, food is eaten and destroyed, so it can't be appreciated in the same way as other beautiful things.
There are also many ethical issues surrounding food. For example, we might wonder what we should eat: organic, free-range, locally grown, or vegetarian? Our answers will reveal our values and beliefs. Philosophers will ask why we make these choices.
Cooking at home is different from cooking in a restaurant. At home, we cook for our friends and family, and everyone is included. In a restaurant, the chef has responsibilities to their employer and the food, and the kitchen is not open to everyone.
Food can also bring people together from different cultures. We can learn to appreciate other cultures by trying their food, and we can build relationships by sharing meals together. This is an important part of international diplomacy.
The text I simplified is more concise and uses simpler vocabulary, making it easier for a B1 learner to understand. I removed some of the complex philosophical ideas and focused on the main points, while still keeping the essential information."

Rob Daviau, from the US, creates special board games called 'legacy' games. He wanted to make games more exciting and challenging than the ones he played as a child. He asked himself: ""Can a board game have a story? Can decisions we make in one game affect the next one?"" He took a classic game called Risk and changed it to make it 'legacy'. This means that players can damage the board or cards during the game, and their choices have a lasting impact. The game is played over several sessions, and players can remember what happened in previous games.
Daviau was asked to work on a 'legacy' version of a popular game called Pandemic. In this game, players work together to stop diseases from spreading. He then created a new game called SeaFall. This game is set in the 16th to 19th centuries and players are sailors trying to explore a new world.
To make 'legacy' games, designers need to think about all the possible choices players can make. They test the game with players to see how it works. One player, Jaime Barriga, said it takes a lot of time to test a game like SeaFall. He said that the game starts well, but then it can get confusing and players need to go back and fix things.
At first, Daviau didn't think 'legacy' games would be popular. He thought only a few people would like them. But many players loved the idea of a game with a story that changes over time. One player, Russell Chapman, said it's like a new level of excitement and challenge. Another player, Ben Hogg, said it's like watching a TV series - you don't want to watch the same episode twice.
The idea of 'legacy' games is influenced by video games and TV shows. Daviau used to want to be a TV writer, but he became a game designer instead. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, said making a 'legacy' game is like writing a book. You need to plan the beginning and end, but also be flexible. Daviau hopes that other designers will take the idea and make it their own."

A long time ago, an octopus named Inky escaped from his tank at the New Zealand Aquarium. He climbed out of the tank, crawled across the floor, and squeezed through a small drain to get to the ocean. This story was shared online and people loved it. It's fun to imagine animals doing human-like things, like opening jars or using tools. Octopuses are especially interesting because they are very smart and have bodies that are very different from ours. They can even play and solve problems.
Dr. Frans de Waal, a scientist who studies animals, says that it's not wrong to imagine animals are like us. In fact, he thinks that people often don't recognize the smart things animals can do because they are too different from us. For a long time, people thought that only humans could think about the past and the future, be kind to others, and understand what others are thinking. But scientists have found that many animals can do these things too.
In the past, people thought animals were very smart and could even be put on trial for crimes. Charles Darwin, a famous scientist, also thought that animals were smart and that there wasn't a big difference between human and animal intelligence.
But in the 20th century, people started to think that animals were just machines that reacted to things, or robots that had useful instincts. This was a problem because it led to people treating animals badly. Now, Dr. de Waal thinks that people are starting to realize that animals are smart and have their own ways of thinking.
The best way to test animal intelligence is to use tests that are designed for each species. For example, squirrels are good at remembering where they hide food, but they might not be good at remembering human things. Dr. de Waal thinks that if an octopus could test human intelligence, it might give us a hard time because we can't do some things as well as they can.
The story of Inky the octopus is a fun one, but Dr. de Waal thinks it might be a bit too optimistic. He thinks it's unlikely that Inky really figured out how to get to the ocean. However, he does think that stories like this can help people appreciate how smart animals are."

'Robots are changing the way we work. They are becoming more common in many industries, not just in manufacturing and cars. Experts think that many jobs will be taken over by robots in the next few years. Some people think that robots will do most of the work that humans do now, but many people also think that their jobs will stay the same. However, this is not true. Robots will affect many jobs, including those in supermarkets and construction.
For example, a company in Australia has made a robot that can lay bricks much faster than humans. A robot in a supermarket in the US checks that shelves are stocked and priced correctly. Some people think that robots will create new jobs for technicians and programmers, but others are worried about the loss of jobs that require human skills.
Dr. Jing Bing Zhang, an expert on robotics, says that robots will be smarter and more efficient in the future. He thinks that many companies will need people with skills in robotics, but there may not be enough workers with these skills. He suggests that people should learn new skills to adapt to the changing job market.
Robots will also be used in homes and will interact with us in new ways. This could be exciting, but it also raises questions about safety and privacy. To prepare for the future, we need more people with skills in science, technology, engineering, and maths (STEM). This will help us stay competitive in the job market.'

Many people wonder why climbers risk their lives to climb mountains. The famous climber George Mallory said, ""Because it's there."" This answer is simple and general, and it reminds us that sometimes people do things just for the fun of it.
A Bolivian writer, Tejada-Flores, wrote an important essay about climbing. He said that there are different types of climbing, each with its own rules. Climbers choose how to climb based on the rules of the game they are playing.
Some people love climbing because it makes them feel free. They enjoy the feeling of being in nature and the challenge of overcoming obstacles. However, climbing can also be confining and restricting. Climbers may feel trapped in a tent during a storm.
A US rock climber, Joe Fitschen, asked a different question: ""Why do people climb?"" He said that climbing is in our nature. Humans have always been drawn to challenges and taking risks. Climbing is a way for us to test our limits and push ourselves.
Another expert, Brian Treanor, said that climbing helps people develop important qualities like courage, humility, and respect for the environment. Climbing can also help people develop virtues that are important in our modern world.
Some climbers believe that climbing on their own, without help from others, requires complete commitment to the goal. This can make their achievements more meaningful.
Climbing can also be a way to be in the moment, to be fully focused on the task at hand. This is similar to the techniques used in Zen philosophy to achieve a state of inner peace.
These are just a few reasons why people might climb mountains. Ultimately, the reasons are personal and can vary from person to person."

Alfred Brendel was a famous pianist who played classical music for many years. He was a serious person who focused on his work and didn't teach many students. People who knew him said he had a playful side, but it wasn't often shown in his concerts. He spent most of his time studying, traveling, and performing.
One day, a 14-year-old boy named Kit Armstrong came to one of Brendel's concerts and asked for lessons. Brendel wasn't sure at first, but he was impressed by Kit's talent and asked him to play for him. Brendel was surprised by Kit's skills and decided to take him as a student.
Kit is now 19 and is still learning from Brendel. He is a hard worker and also likes to learn new things, such as languages, math, and computer programming. He even composes music. Brendel says that Kit has a great memory and can play music very well.
Brendel is careful not to put too much pressure on Kit. He wants Kit to learn at his own pace and not get too stressed. Brendel himself didn't become famous until he was older, and he thinks it's important for Kit to focus on his music rather than trying to be famous too quickly.
Now that Brendel is 80 years old, he is enjoying his retirement and still thinks about music all the time. He has many ideas for new pieces he wants to play, even though he doesn't play anymore. He is happy to be able to focus on his own interests and hobbies."

I thought that gardens were always beautiful and peaceful when I was little. My grandad's garden was special. It was near a river and had a gentle slope down to the water. I couldn't reach the river, but I could hear the sound of the water and the birds singing in the trees. I imagined that all gardens were like this - a place to escape and relax. My grandad's garden wasn't special because of big things like a greenhouse. He didn't have one, but his neighbors did. They made their own greenhouses from old windows. My dad was a quiet person, but he had a sense of humor. He liked to use funny phrases, like ""It's immaterial to me."" He wasn't very ambitious and didn't like his job as a plumber. But he was good at fixing things around the house. My parents moved house only once, but my mom liked to buy new furniture. She brought home a piano once, but I was too scared to play it. My sister got lessons instead. When I asked my mom why I couldn't play the piano, she said I wouldn't practice. I loved the river and would often go there with my imagination. I would walk along the riverbank, looking for a good spot to take off my sandals and go fishing. I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but my dad thought I might be interested in a job as a gardener in the Parks Department.

He thinks the industry needs people who can design games, not just directors who make big decisions.
To get into the industry, Jim says you need to make games. You can't just apply for a job without showing that you can design a game. John Field, another expert, agrees that making games is important, but he also thinks you need to have the right skills and knowledge.
John says that it's hard to do it on your own, but a good course can help. Many game designers start as programmers or artists and work their way up. They need to be interested in all kinds of entertainment and art, and have a passion for games.
Networking is also important. You need to make connections to get ahead in the industry. The video game industry is no longer just for kids. It's a grown-up medium that's popular with families and people of all ages. There are many opportunities to learn and have fun, and the industry is still growing."

I've always loved playing football. My dad encouraged me to play, but he didn't force me to. I'm glad he didn't, because it made me enjoy it more. I had a friend who played with us, but his dad was always pushing him to do better. This made my friend stop playing and he never played again. I'm glad it didn't happen to me. When I score a goal from far away, people say it's just luck, but I've worked hard to improve my shooting skills since I was a kid. Practice is important to achieve great things. Even the best players in the world need to practice a lot to get to where they are.
I used to play many sports at school, but football was my favorite. I want my son to enjoy learning new skills, not just focus on one thing. We're already reading to him, even though he's too young to sit still. I hope he doesn't take after me and only wants to kick the ball around.
When I started my professional football career, our manager gave us opportunities to play with the first team. He didn't make a big fuss about it, but we knew we had to work hard. We lost our first game, and a famous TV presenter said, ""You can't win with kids."" This made us realize how much we had to do. We had doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team.
I rely on my close friends and family. Sometimes, having a lot of money can cause problems. Some people think I should help my parents more, but I've already paid off their mortgage and bought them a car. My family is strong and independent, and they wouldn't want me to support them financially. I like using my money to make things easier for the people around me.
After I stop playing, I want to take a year off and do things I haven't been able to do before. I want to go skiing, but I can't do it now because I need to be careful not to get hurt and not be able to play football again."

We moved to Reef Point because of Sam Carter, my father's agent in Los Angeles. He helped us find a cheap place to live because my father couldn't write while we were in Los Angeles. The beach was usually empty in the summer because of the fog. But now, with the hot weather, the beach was full of people. My father was working hard on a script and was very stressed. I would often go to the beach with my dog, Rusty. He was a stray who followed us from the beginning. One day, my father got angry with him, but Rusty just kept coming back. I thought he might belong to us, but my father said he thought we belonged to Rusty! Rusty loved the beach and would dig up things and bring them to me. Sometimes, he would find things that didn't belong to him, like a new shoe or towel. I would return them to their owners. Rusty also loved swimming and would always come with me, even though he couldn't swim as well as I could. We had been swimming all day, and now the sun was setting. We sat on the beach and watched the surfers. One surfer caught my eye - she was very good! She asked me to join them, but I didn't have a surfboard. She suggested I could buy one, but I didn't have the money. She asked if I was British and visiting, and I said I lived there. She asked if my father was American, and I said no. She asked about his book, ""Tall as the Morning"", and I nodded. She looked at me with interest, and I thought that was how it always was - people were friendly, but only interested when they knew something about my father's book."

Violet was standing in a long queue at the dock in Southampton. She was waiting to board the Queen Caroline, but the queue wasn't moving. Her friend Annie had told her to get to the dock late, but now Violet was regretting that advice. There was a problem with the computer system, and the passengers were getting angry. Violet was feeling frustrated and anxious. She couldn't find her phone, and she needed it to call a taxi company to check if she had left it in the taxi. She was worried because she had stored all her important numbers in her phone.
A kind-looking couple behind her offered to let her use their phone to call her son Harry. Violet asked Harry to ask her neighbor Kristina to check if the phone was left in her flat. She was relieved that Kristina would be able to help her. Finally, the queue started moving, and Violet was able to board the ship. She was disappointed by the ship's interior, which was not as luxurious as she had expected. The elevators were crowded and had mirrors all around, making her feel self-conscious. When she finally reached her room, she was relieved to find that it had a balcony, which was what she had been hoping for.

John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an auction. He didn't know what he was getting. He was looking for pictures to use in a book about his neighborhood in Chicago. Instead, he found 30,000 pictures taken by a street photographer named Vivian Maier. Maloof was surprised and excited. He started to learn more about Maier's life and work.
Maier was born in New York and grew up in France. She moved to Chicago in 1956 to work as a nanny. She always carried a camera with her and took pictures of people, children, and everyday life. She was a private person, but she wasn't afraid to talk to strangers and take their pictures.
Malloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon are trying to learn more about Maier's life. They talked to people who knew her and looked at her pictures. Maier's pictures are special because they are not just about famous buildings or events. They are about the people and the everyday life of the city.
Malloof is amazed by Maier's work and wants to share it with others. He thinks she is an important artist and wants to get her name known. He hopes to put her pictures in museums and books so that people can see her work.

Eleanor Catton's book, The Luminaries, is a big success. When people say it's ambitious, they usually mean it's trying to do too much. But not in this case. I met Eleanor in the UK when her book was very popular. She was very calm, even though she was still young and had just flown in from Germany. She told me a funny story about being stopped at the airport and asked to prove she was a writer. She showed the official her book and he asked what it was about. This is not an easy question for an author!
The book is set in New Zealand in the 1860s. A group of 12 men are trying to solve some crimes. The story gets very complicated. Eleanor wanted to write a murder mystery, but she found that the past offered more opportunities for mistakes and misunderstandings. The book is very long, over 800 pages, because she wanted to give each of the 20 main characters a good part.
When I asked her how it feels to be so successful at a young age, she said it's nice because everyone in her country feels like they're part of the success. She also said it's annoying when people think she's not trying to do something important in her book. Eleanor wanted to write a book with a special structure. She wanted it to be like a spiral, with each part getting shorter. I asked if it matters if readers notice this. She said she wanted to create a book with patterns that don't matter, but if you look closely, you can see them.
The book is an exciting murder mystery with a good plot. Eleanor didn't plan it beforehand. She just wrote herself into a difficult situation and then tried to find a way out. She also wanted to make the book fun for the reader. We talked about her love of TV shows, and how her book has cliffhangers, multiple viewpoints, and dialogue. I asked if she might want to write for TV. She said that could be cool. She loves talking about her craft and New Zealand. She notices that her imagination changes when she's in a different place. For now, she'll stay in New Zealand for inspiration."

Jonny Kinkead has been making guitars for over 40 years. As a boy, he loved playing guitar and building things with his dad in the garage. He still loves guitars today. Jonny learned to play his brother's guitar when he was 11 and then started building his own guitars when he was 16. He wanted to learn how to make different sounds and shapes. Jonny and his brothers used to build model boats and planes, so he was familiar with the process. He also fixed and customized instruments for his friends.
After school, Jonny studied architecture at university, but he didn't finish. He realized that building guitars was a type of sculpture that involved creating something people could use. He started making guitars for a living and sold them to musicians. At first, he didn't make much money, but as he got better, people started to notice his work and he could charge more.
Jonny says that it's easier for young guitar-makers today to start a career because people now recognize the quality of UK-made guitars. He thinks it's important to learn from others and take classes, but also to try new things and make mistakes. This is how he learned to make guitars."

Talking about the weather is a common topic in English conversations. Many people start their conversations with the weather, just like Dr. Johnson did over 200 years ago. He said that when two English people meet, they usually talk about the weather first. This is still true today.
Some people try to explain why English people are so interested in the weather. They think that we must be fascinated by it. But that's not the case. The weather is not exciting or unpredictable in England, unlike in other parts of the world.
Actually, talking about the weather is not about the weather at all. It's a way for English people to start conversations and be friendly. We use phrases like ""Nice day, isn't it?"" or ""It's cold today, isn't it?"" to be polite and make small talk. These phrases are like a secret code to help us feel more comfortable with each other.
There are certain situations when we use these phrases. We might use them as a greeting, to break the ice and start a conversation. We might also use them when we're not sure what to talk about or when there's an awkward silence. It's easy to see why people might think that English people are obsessed with the weather, but really, we're just using it as a way to be friendly and make conversation."

Alice Leader was standing in front of Hadrian's Wall in Britain, explaining to her 12- and 13-year-old students how amazing it was that the Romans built something so long and strong 1,900 years ago. She was trying to answer their question about why it was built, but she didn't feel like she had the right answers. She decided to write a story to help her students understand what life was like at the Wall during Roman times. After teaching for 31 years, Alice started writing books for children in 2001. She liked teaching, but writing was a new and exciting challenge.
Alice wanted to write books that were different from most others. She thought many books for children were too dark or too fantastical. She wanted her books to be about real people and their everyday lives. Alice loved teaching English and History together, and she loved seeing her students get interested in a subject. She saw writing as a way to continue teaching, but in a new way.
Alice was inspired to write her first book because she wanted to fill a gap in the market. She also wanted to write because her children were growing up and leaving home, and she was looking for a new challenge. A teacher at her school suggested she take a creative writing course, and Alice was surprised to find that she enjoyed it. She wrote a story about a Roman couple and their baby-to-be, and the other students on the course liked it so much that they encouraged her to publish it.
Alice's husband, Zachary Leader, helped her edit her book. He is a writer and critic, and he gave her good advice on how to make her writing better. Alice is grateful to have him as her editor. She says that writing is a different process than teaching, but it's just as important."

'Two brothers, Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, are famous triathletes. They decided to take part in a special race to help raise money for charity. The race was unique because Jonny would drive a car and Alistair would ride a bike. They started at a beautiful lake in the Yorkshire Dales and had to reach the same point, but in different ways. Jonny was excited to drive on the roads with nice views, but Alistair was worried because he had to ride up a big hill. The race started and the brothers went their separate ways. Jonny had to stop for a tractor and deal with a narrow road, while Alistair had to carry his bike up the hill. After a while, they both reached the top and started going down the other side. Jonny had to slow down for a stream on the road, while Alistair was flying across the fields. Finally, they both reached the finish line. Alistair was the first to arrive and looked around, wondering where Jonny was. Jonny arrived a few minutes later and was disappointed to have lost. He said, ""Well done, Alistair. I'm really sorry I lost.""'

When I play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, I notice the silence. I bounce the ball, serve, and hit it. The soft grass, the old stadium, and the players in white clothes all make me feel calm. The quiet of the court helps me focus. I try to block out everything except the game and the point I'm playing.
The only noise is the applause and cheers after a point is finished. I hear them, but it's like they're far away. I don't think about the 15,000 people watching or the millions watching on TV. I'm so focused that I don't feel like I'm playing in front of a big crowd.
I've always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My coach, my uncle Toni, told me it was the biggest tournament. When I was 14, I shared my dream with my friends. I played here before, but lost to Roger Federer. Last year, I was very sad after losing. I knew I could have done better.
This year, I'm more confident. I've learned from my mistakes. I know I can win. The day before the final, we didn't talk about the match at dinner. I was already thinking about the game in my head. From now on, I need to focus and stay calm until the match starts.
I've made some changes to the original text to make it more accessible to a B1 learner. I've:
* Simplified vocabulary and sentence structures
* Removed complex sentences and rephrased them into simpler ones
* Removed some of the more abstract concepts and focused on the concrete details of the scene
* Removed some of the emotional language and focused on the main points of the story
* Added more concrete language to help the reader visualize the scene"

'Jane Goodall, a young English woman, went to Africa in 1957. She wrote to her family, ""I'm living in the Africa I've always dreamed of."" Jane spent most of her life in Africa, working as a scientist, journalist, and environmentalist. She became famous for her research on chimpanzees.
In 1963, a big organization in Britain made her a famous scientist by publishing articles and TV shows about her work. She wrote books for children and adults, and one of her books, ""In the Shadow of Man"", was very popular and was translated into many languages.
Many people know Jane Goodall, but they often don't understand what she really did. She is often described as a brave and adventurous person who loved animals, but this doesn't show how important her work was. She actually discovered many new things about chimpanzees, like that they eat meat, use tools, and have the same emotions as humans. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe"", is the most important book about chimpanzees and is still used by scientists today.
Jane Goodall's work changed the way we study animals and think about ourselves. Even when she was a child, there were signs that she would become a scientist. When she was five years old, she went into a henhouse to find out how hens lay eggs. She hid in the straw and waited until the hen showed her how. This might have been the start of her career as a biologist.'

Shirley Ford is a voiceover artist. She can speak in many different voices. She can be a cheeky 8-year-old boy, a tired mother, or a fast-talking alien. She has worked on many projects, including TV shows, cartoons, and advertisements. 
Shirley says that many actors think they can do funny voices, but it's not just about doing funny voices. You have to bring the script to life and make the audience feel like they are seeing you. Many famous actors want to do voiceover work, but they don't always get the job because they are used to acting with their whole body.
Shirley started taking drama classes after school. She got some small jobs singing jingles for TV commercials. Then, she got a big part in a cartoon as a rabbit. She realized she could do voices and decided to focus on voiceover work.
Shirley often plays the voices of children. She has to learn to make different sounds from the back of her throat to sound like a child. She watches children's TV to get new voices. She has worked on many projects, from educational videos to advertisements. 
Shirley says that the key to being a good voiceover artist is to be able to smile while you're talking. This makes your voice sound happy and cheerful. She also says that it's important to have a good showreel, which is a recording that shows what you can do. She recommends attending special workshops to learn more about voiceover work.
Shirley is very passionate about her job. She loves making different voices and becoming the characters she is performing. Sometimes, she even talks like the character for hours or days after she finishes recording. Her children are used to her talking in different voices."

People often ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a dream job that many people have when they're young, like being a famous actor or a sports star. But most people give up on these dreams and choose more practical jobs, like being an accountant or a engineer. It seems impossible to make a living by drawing simple cartoons like the ones you find in school notebooks. But some people do it. 
As for me, I studied graphic design in college and then showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted my political cartoons. After a few months, I was making enough money to support myself. 
To become a cartoonist, you don't need a university degree, a lot of money, or even drawing skills. You just need your brain, your hands, and something to make marks. However, it's not an easy job. It takes a lot of hard work and dedication. You should only try to become a cartoonist if you really can't imagine doing anything else.
I've done many different types of cartoons, such as political cartoons, comic strips, and comic books. I've also been a writer, a caricaturist, and a designer. I take on any job I can get, even if it's not my favorite, because you can learn a lot from it. 
Nowadays, most cartoonists have to work for themselves and sell their work. It's not just about creating art, but also about marketing and selling it. I've seen cartoonists with average drawing skills but excellent business skills do better than those with amazing drawing skills but no business skills. 
Some people are worried that someone will steal their ideas, so they don't show their work to anyone. But it's not a big deal if someone steals your work. If it becomes popular, it can be a lucky break!"

Twenty years ago, I was moving to a new house and getting rid of some old things. I decided to throw away an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday. I didn't want to get rid of it, but I did. I took it to the dump and was about to throw it away when a young man asked me if I was sure I wanted to get rid of it. I said yes, but then I felt a little sad. He asked if he could have it, and I said okay. Later, I got an email from someone who found my guitar. He had bought it from someone who had bought it from the man who took it from me at the dump. He wanted to sell it back to me. I was very happy to see my old guitar again. I had almost forgotten about it.
My dad had given me the guitar because he wanted me to learn to play the classical guitar. I liked the sound of the classical guitar, but I couldn't play it very well. So, I switched to the electric guitar. I played simple songs, and it was fun. Now, I'm playing again. When I picked up my old guitar, I remembered my birthday when my parents gave it to me. It felt nice and smooth to play again. I even remembered how to play some chords without thinking about it. I might start a band with my son, who plays the saxophone. Or maybe other people who have had a similar experience like mine will join us. We could call ourselves ""The Regainers"".

There's been a lot of talk about sleep lately. I wrote a book about people who can't sleep, and I think it's very important to talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on our minds, bodies, and moods. Sleep is crucial for our well-being. But I've noticed that people don't often talk about dreams. When we wake up early, we often cut off the last hour or two of sleep, which is the most important stage for dreams. Our most vivid and memorable dreams happen during this stage.
Researchers have been studying dreams for a long time. They used to think that dreams were important for understanding our minds, but now they think they might be more important for our creativity. Dreams can help us think in new and creative ways by combining things we know with things we've learned before. This can help us find new solutions to problems and come up with new ideas.
Many people, including artists, writers, and actors, have reported that their dreams help them with their work. For example, actors and writers often use their dreams as inspiration for their performances or stories. But it's not just artists who need to think creatively. We all need to be able to think creatively and flexibly in our daily lives, whether it's at work, with friends, or with family. So, we should all pay attention to our dreams and try to understand how they can help us be more creative and think more clearly.

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London and moved to a small coastal town in south-west England. She is a famous copyist artist who can paint beautiful copies of famous paintings. She has painted many famous artworks, including those by Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so good that art experts think they are the originals.
Susie's clients are galleries and private collectors. Some of them are art lovers, but others buy her paintings to show off their wealth. Some even display her copies instead of the original paintings to save money on insurance. Susie is honest about what she does. She makes her copies look as authentic as possible, but she always signs her name on the back of the canvas.
Susie didn't always make copies. After she finished art school, she worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. She had to be very accurate and precise in her work. This experience helped her develop her skills and attention to detail, which she uses to make her copies.
When young artists come to her for advice, Susie tells them to learn to draw and be accurate. She also emphasizes the importance of studying and practicing. She specializes in painting French impressionist art, which is very challenging because the artists were both quick and meticulous.
Some people might think it's strange that Susie doesn't create her own original art. She says that what she does is the result of years of training and hard work, and it makes her a good living. She has tried to create her own art, but it wasn't as good as her copies. She is a perfectionist, which is what makes her so good at what she does."

Ellen MacArthur loved the sea and racing. She was obsessed with being the fastest person on the water. She spent her childhood and adult life sailing around the world.

She took me on a tour of her boat and showed me how she kept everything organized. She said that her sailing days taught her the importance of being prepared.
After one of her big races, she went on a trip to a remote island in the Atlantic. She helped count birds and saw old whaling stations. This made her realize how we take things without thinking about the consequences. She felt that we need to change our ways and use things more carefully.

Jordan Romero is a 13-year-old boy who wants to climb Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. If he succeeds, he might become very famous. Jordan wants to inspire other kids to go outside and be active, instead of just playing video games or using their computers all the time. He is climbing with his parents, Paul and Karen, who are experienced climbers. They are part of a team called ""Team Romero"" and have already climbed five of the highest mountains in the world. Jordan is trying to become the youngest person to climb all seven of these mountains.
Some people think it's not a good idea for a 13-year-old to climb Mount Everest. They worry that Jordan might not be strong enough or experienced enough to make it safely. Jordan's parents have thought about these risks and are taking steps to make sure he is safe. They believe that their own experience as climbers will help them navigate any challenges they might face.
Jordan's motivation for climbing Mount Everest is not just to be famous, but to inspire others to get outside and be active. He enjoys the challenge of climbing and is focused on achieving his goal. Jordan's parents are also careful to make sure he doesn't lose his motivation. They talk to him regularly to make sure he is still excited about the climb.
Jordan's climb is not just about him, but also about inspiring others. He knows that if he wants to inspire kids to be active, he needs to share his adventure with others. This means writing about his experiences and talking to the media. But if Jordan decides he no longer wants to climb mountains, his parents will stop the project and focus on something else, like playing basketball."

Do you know what kind of music teenagers usually listen to? It's not classical music. Most people my age can't even name a classical composer like Brahms. I'm studying music, but my classmates know as little about classical music as anyone else our age. If you don't know who wrote the music, you're unlikely to buy their records. The statistics are worrying for classical music lovers. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music, and the average classical record sells only 300 copies. So, why has classical music lost its appeal? The older generation blames our love of TV and video games, but I think that's not the reason. The truth is that classical music just isn't interesting to most people, especially teenagers. I know some teenagers who love classical music, but they're a minority. I'm a musician and play in an orchestra, but I'm not a big fan of classical music myself. I like all kinds of music, but my computer shows I don't listen to much classical music. So, why don't teenagers like classical music? One reason is that classical music is slow and has many changes in mood, which can be hard to follow. We like fast-paced things and can't focus for more than a few minutes. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music requires attention and concentration. Pop music also deals with issues that are important to teenagers, while classical music doesn't. The way we listen to music has changed too. In the past, families would make music together at home, and playing an instrument was important. Nowadays, we can find any music we want easily, but classical music is not part of our daily lives. When was the last time you heard classical music in a shop? My teacher says that more people are going to classical concerts, but I bet most of them are not teenagers. I play classical music in different places, but the audience is usually older people. I don't know why people like classical music more when they're older, but I do know that if your parents like something, you're less likely to like it too. Some people think that schools are to blame for the lack of interest in classical music, but there are many kids who love playing classical music in their school orchestra. They practice before school and after school, but it's not their favorite music. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, we listen to pop music."

Bonnie got out of her mother's car and looked at Almonside School. She said to herself, 'I'll show you, school.' Her mother was getting out of the car, but Bonnie didn't care if she heard. Bonnie's mother knew how she felt.
Mrs. Wyndham looked around and saw that Almonside School was a bit strange. The buildings were hidden among the trees on a hillside. Then she saw signs that said 'Science block', 'gymnasium', and 'riding centre'. Bonnie saw the 'riding centre' sign and got interested. 'Let's go that way,' her mother said.
Bonnie followed her mother to the headmaster's office. Her mother talked to the headmaster while Bonnie waited outside. Bonnie didn't like waiting and thought, 'I'll get in trouble anyway, so why not do what I want?' She left the office and went to the riding centre.
The riding centre had nice old buildings and a big indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one there. She liked horses and treated them with respect.

I met Cody Simpson before and was impressed by his confidence. He's a 15-year-old Australian singer who has already released many popular songs. So, how did he go from being a laid-back surfer to performing in front of thousands of fans?
Cody started playing the guitar when he was six and writing songs at seven. But at the time, he loved swimming and surfing more. He was 13 and in high school when he posted some videos online. People loved them and asked for more. Cody was happy to share more videos, and the response was amazing.
Cody was a good swimmer and was training hard with a coach. But then record labels wanted to sign him, and he had to make a big decision: stay in Australia or move to the US. He chose to take a risk and move to the US with his family.
It was hard for Cody to choose a career at such a young age. He had to tell his swimming coach and friends that he was leaving. They were surprised, but Cody is a modest person and thinks it's important to stay humble.
Cody's family is important to him, and they support him even though they don't get involved in his music career. Sometimes Cody worries about how his decision affects his little brother and sister. But his family reassures him that they're there for him.
Success comes from taking a chance and saying 'yes' to big opportunities. Cody's story is an inspiration: he never thought he'd be performing in front of so many fans. He knows it won't last forever, but he's grateful for the experience."

I woke up early, got out of bed, and looked out the window. The river was frozen, but there was a small crack in the ice. I could see the wall of sandbags on the other side of the river, which were there to protect the buildings from flooding. I had worked hard with the other adults in the town to put them there. My grandfather didn't seem to notice.

I put on my wetsuit and grabbed my kayaking jacket. I also took my lucky chain, which my grandfather brought back from a trip to South America. I keep it in my pocket as a reminder of him.
I went to the kitchen to get something to eat. My mom was already up and cooking breakfast. She asked me if I was going kayaking and told me to be careful. I said goodbye and headed out the door.
As I was leaving, I ran into my grandfather. He was grumpy and asked me where I was going. I told him I was going kayaking, but he didn't seem to care. He's been grumpy a lot lately, and it's hard for me to ignore it. He's always been my hero, but now he's not as nice as he used to be.
I went to the boathouse to get my kayak ready. My mom called out to me to be careful and said she admired my determination to keep practicing, even on cold days. I smiled and headed out to the river.

Mum grabbed Jess's arm and said, 'Come with me.' They went to the study and there was a painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa's, but it looked very different from his other paintings. It was not finished, but Jess had never seen anything like it before. The painting showed a river, but it didn't look like a real river. The riverbank was very small and green, and the water seemed to go on forever. There were no animals, people, or birds in the picture. It was a strange and beautiful painting.
Mum said, 'This painting has a name.' She sounded a bit strange when she said it. Jess knew why. Grandpa never named his paintings. Mum turned the painting over and showed Jess the words. Jess read them out loud: 'River Boy.' The words seemed important, but Jess didn't know why.
Jess looked at Mum. 'There is no boy in the picture,' she said. Mum said, 'Yes, that's strange. Grandpa never names his paintings, but this one has a name. Maybe he will add a boy later.' Mum had asked Grandpa about the painting, but he didn't like it when people asked him about his work. He said that each painting has its own meaning, and people either understand it or they don't. He said that artists should focus on their work, not explain it to everyone.
Mum was hoping that Jess could help her understand the painting, since Grandpa often talked about her as his muse. A muse is someone who inspires an artist. Jess knew what the word meant, but she didn't think Grandpa meant her. She thought he meant a goddess or a mythical figure. 'Grandpa doesn't need me to inspire him,' she said. 'He's been painting for a long time.'

This morning, I didn't mean to cut a hole in my carpet. It was an accident, but I could have done it on purpose. I was trying to fit a special cabinet into my bedroom, but it was too big for the corner. The cabinet was given to me by my grandmother, and I loved it. It's small and has pretty flowers on it. I was trying to find a way to make it fit, but I didn't think it through. I was thinking about cutting a hole in the carpet, but I didn't mean to. It just seemed like a good idea at the time. Sometimes I do things like that. My room is small and has a sloping roof, which I like. The problem is that it only has two corners, and I need more space. I was trying to find a solution to fit the cabinet, and cutting a hole in the carpet seemed like a good idea. My dad would be proud of me for thinking outside the box.

'The novel ""The Borrowers"" is about a family of small people who live in the walls and floors of a house. They take things from the normal-sized people without them noticing. When I was asked to make a TV show based on the book, I knew it would be difficult. People who love the book have strong ideas about how it should be done. I used the original drawings from the book to help me. The author wanted the show to be from the Borrowers' point of view, not from a human's. This made filming more complicated. The most important thing was to get the size right. The Borrowers are 10 times smaller than humans, so we had to film them from 10 times farther away. When filming the surroundings, the crew had to crawl on the ground and film from very low. We never raised the camera high except for special shots. One big problem was making the shadows look right when the small Borrowers were in a big room. We developed a special technique for this. After the show was finished, a famous film director, George Lucas, called me to ask how I did it. The only permanent set we built was the Borrowers' home under the floorboards. It was very surreal. The actors had to carry big objects like giant scissors and coins. They were hard to lift and made the crew laugh a lot. In one scene, the Borrowers get swept away by a drain. The actors had to go through a tunnel with water and said it was very scary. I was very careful about the costumes. They were made of heavy material so they looked like doll clothes. This made it hard for the actors to move around. The weather was very hot during filming, and the actors didn't thank me for the costumes. Most of the scenes were filmed in front of a blue screen, and the actors had to react to things that weren't there. I drew pictures of every scene to help them understand what to do. I drew over 2,000 pictures! It was a lot of work, but it all came together in the end, and I think the show was successful in capturing the magic of the books.'"

Being a teenager in the US is not easy. They have to do well in school, work part-time, volunteer, and have a social life. It's a lot of pressure. Many people think that teenagers are lazy, rude, and selfish, but this is not true. Teenagers like Kristen Loose and Lindamarie Olsen work hard and have many responsibilities. They have a lot of homework, tests, and activities at school, and they also have to help at home and have a social life.
People often think that teenagers spend all their time watching TV and playing with their phones, but this is not true. They use their phones to make their lives easier and to stay connected with their families. With the help of smartphones and social media, students can do their homework anywhere and anytime. This means they have to be available 24/7, which can be tiring.
Many teenagers wake up early and go to bed late, and they often don't get enough sleep. The US National Sleep Foundation says that 20% of teenagers get the recommended 9 hours of sleep a night. Some teenagers even fall asleep in school because they are so tired.
Despite all their responsibilities, many teenagers like Lindamarie Olsen still find time to volunteer and help others. She thinks that the stereotype of teenagers is that they are only focused on themselves, but this is not true. Many teenagers are kind and want to make a positive impact in their community.
In the future, the stereotype of teenagers may change, but one thing is certain - they will continue to work hard and make a difference."

The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers who live in a small town in the US, surrounded by wilderness. They have been launching balloons to the edge of space for years. It's a science project, but also an adventure. They launch a new balloon each weekend, and sometimes they even get to see shooting stars. Shooting stars happen when a rock or piece of metal from space enters the Earth's atmosphere and creates a trail of light.
Before they launch the balloon, they prepare it with a special lunch box attached to the bottom. Inside the lunch box, they put a camera, a device to measure altitude, and a thermometer. They also attach GPS trackers to the outside of the lunch box so they can find it later. The balloon is inflated with a special gas, and it grows to the size of a small car.
When it's time to launch, they count down from five and the balloon starts to rise. Some of them run and shine their flashlights on the balloon as it goes up. They feel a sense of wonder and excitement. After the launch, they stay to watch the stars. They lie on blankets and look at the very clear sky. It's hard to believe they're just a few hours from a big city with millions of people.
The balloon eventually pops and the equipment inside the lunch box falls back to Earth. The students use the GPS trackers to find it the next day. Sometimes it's hard to get to the lunch box, but that's part of the fun. They have to drive or walk through the wilderness to get to it. The leader of the group says that it's an important part of the project to learn about the landscape and how to navigate it.
On this occasion, it took them 11 hours to find the lunch box. It was in a canyon, high on a rock, near a waterfall. Unfortunately, the camera didn't record any shooting stars, but they had a great time arguing about the effects of atmospheric waves and how they work above mountain ridges. It's another adventure story to tell."

Chloe Morgan didn't really like science or dinosaurs when she was younger. But when she was 15, she helped her brother with a school project and read an article about new discoveries in the field. This really interested her and she decided to learn more.
Chloe remembers meeting a professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was very kind and patient with her questions. This made her feel more comfortable and encouraged her to learn more.
I ask her about how palaeontologists are often portrayed in movies and TV shows. Chloe says that while these shows have increased interest in dinosaurs, they often show palaeontologists in a bad light. She thinks they are usually shown as either very clever but a bit strange or not very good with people.
Chloe's job is not just about digging up dinosaur bones. She also spends time in the lab analyzing fossils and writing about her findings. She also likes to explain science to the public, especially to children. She thinks it's important to show them how exciting science can be and how it can help us understand the world.
Recently, Chloe was involved in a TV documentary about dinosaurs. She was happy to help the producers make sure the dinosaurs were accurate and realistic. She thinks dinosaurs continue to fascinate us because they are unknown and remind us that there is still so much to discover. Palaeontology is a way for us to travel back in time and learn more about the world."

When you're going on a car trip with your family, you know you're not there yet, even if you keep asking 'Are we there yet?' The truth is, when you finally get there, it's not 'there' anymore, it's 'here'. So, you should ask 'Are we here yet?' instead.
As a child, you might feel bored on long car trips. You can watch DVDs, listen to music, or do puzzles while looking out the window at the scenery. Your parents will help you with things like getting snacks or changing the radio station. But sometimes, your sibling might do something annoying, like put their foot on your side of the seat. This can lead to a fight, and your parents will have to separate you.
To deal with this, my dad has a funny trick. When I ask 'Are we there yet?', he says 'Yes, we're here. Get out of the car!' But then I say 'But we're still on the highway!' and he says 'Oh, maybe we're not there yet.' This makes everyone quiet for a while.
You know you're finally 'there' when your parents get out of the car and go away from you. So, if your parents are still near, the answer to your question is 'no, you're not there yet'."

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford where people can enjoy a cup of coffee, cake, and play board games. They want people to have a good time and come back again. Zuzi says they wanted to create a place where people can be together and talk, because everyone is too busy with their phones and gadgets. They like a type of game called Eurogames, which are not too complicated and have gentle themes like farming and building. One popular game is called Pandemic, where players work together to solve problems. The game designer, Matt Leacock, was inspired by another game called Lord of the Rings. He wanted to create a game where everyone feels good, whether they win or lose.
Leacock has always loved board games, but as a child, he got frustrated because the games were too hard or too boring. So, he started designing his own games with the help of his uncle. Pandemic was a big success, and the next version was even better. It has a lot of storytelling and is like an electronic game, where you create your own characters and the game changes as you play.
The growth of video games has actually helped board games become more popular. More people are playing games on their phones, and this has made them more open to playing board games with others. Some people missed playing games with friends and family in the same room, so they started looking for alternative ways to play together. John and Zuzi's café is a place where people can do just that. Playing games has become a way to connect with others in the real world, and this trend is likely to continue."

Jamie Scott is a successful songwriter and producer in the music industry. He believes that perseverance and hard work are essential for success, even when things don't go as planned at first. His mother was a good singer and taught him how to play the guitar. He grew up listening to music from a local radio station that played old songs. He didn't hear a contemporary song until he was 12 years old.
When he was 12, he had to choose between playing tennis and music. He played tennis at a high level, but he didn't enjoy it as much as music. He spent his lunch breaks at school playing the piano and writing songs.
At 17, Jamie left school to pursue a career in music. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist, but they didn't share the same passion for performing. Jamie's parents told him he had 18 months to make it as a performer or he would have to get a job.
After a few close calls with record labels, Jamie was signed to a music publisher at 19. However, the labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to split with his friend. It took him a while to find success, but he eventually became a successful songwriter and producer.
Jamie believes that writing for other artists is where he found his true calling. He helps launch the careers of up-and-coming artists by writing songs that are likely to be successful.

In the UK and other countries, there is a growing trend to encourage students to get involved in research as early as possible in their studies. This is because research is not just for famous professors or scientists. It's a natural way to learn and develop skills. Research skills are useful not only in your studies but also in your future job. As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions and finding answers. You don't just memorize information; you create it.
Research is about asking questions like ""Why?"", ""How?"", ""What does this mean?"", and ""What if?"". It's about thinking critically and not just accepting what others tell you. You need to question what you read and hear, and think about whether it's logical and backed by evidence.
Many students already do research in their daily lives, such as finding out how to fix things or find the right music system. In college and university, you're expected to think critically and construct your own knowledge. You might need to question established knowledge and authorities, but this is an important part of learning.
It's important to engage with what you read and think about it critically. Don't just take information at face value. Instead, test it out, identify biases, and think about whether it's logical and backed by evidence.

Cities have always been important places for learning and creativity. Think of the old coffee shops in London where people discussed new ideas, or the art studios in Paris where Pablo Picasso talked about his art. However, city life is not always easy. The same coffee shops that inspired people also spread diseases. Picasso eventually moved to the countryside. The modern city can be a place of great creativity, but it can also be very stressful and overwhelming.
Scientists are now studying how cities affect our brains. They have found that city life can make us less clever, sometimes very quickly. One reason for this is that cities have very little nature. Studies have shown that patients in hospitals recover faster if they can see trees from their windows. Even just looking at nature for a short time can improve our thinking.
This is important because most people now live in cities. Instead of living in the countryside, we are surrounded by millions of strangers in concrete buildings. In recent years, it has become clear that living in cities has a big impact on our mental and physical health. It can even change how we think.
Imagine walking down a busy street and having to pay attention to many things at once. This can be very tiring. Our brains are like powerful computers, but using them to pay attention takes a lot of energy. Natural places, on the other hand, don't require as much mental effort.
This idea is called attention restoration theory. It was first suggested by a psychologist named Stephen Kaplan. He thought that spending time in nature could help our brains recover from the stress of city life. Natural places have many things that capture our attention, but they don't make us feel anxious or upset. This allows our brains to relax and recharge.
Before scientists discovered this, philosophers and architects were warning about the problems of city life and looking for ways to include nature in cities. Parks like Central Park in New York City are important places where people can escape the stress of city life. Spending time in a park can even improve our brain function.
So, why do cities continue to grow? And why do they remain important places for learning and creativity? Recent research suggests that the same things that make cities stressful can also make them creative. The many social interactions in cities can lead to new ideas and innovations. Just like the crowded coffee shops in 18th-century London led to new ideas, the crowded streets of 21st-century Cambridge, Massachusetts, contribute to its success as a center of technology. The key is to find ways to make cities less stressful while still keeping their creative benefits."

Where is the mind? This might seem like a strange question. We often think that thinking happens inside our heads. And we have special machines that can show us what's going on in our brains. But I think we should look beyond our skin and skull to understand the mind. There's a lot of evidence that shows that things, not just our brains, are important for our thoughts and feelings.
In the past, people used objects like stones, shells, and clay to help them think and solve problems. These objects were an important part of their lives and helped them make decisions. So, I think that what's outside our heads is still a part of our mind.
Most of what we know about the mind comes from studying people in special labs. But this can be limited because it doesn't show us how our minds work in everyday life. I'm not saying that our brains aren't important, but I think we should look at how our minds work with the things around us.
I have a new idea called Material Engagement Theory (MET). It says that our minds are connected to the things we use every day. For example, when we hold a stick, our body thinks it's part of us. This helps us understand how our minds work and how they change over time.
Think about a blind person using a stick. Where does their self begin? It's like their stick is a part of them. This shows us that our minds can change and adapt to new things. Our minds are like a project that's always being updated.
We've been using technology to help us think and solve problems for a long time. From stones to smartphones, these tools have helped us understand the world and ourselves. I think we should look at how these tools have changed our minds and how they will continue to change in the future.

Photography has changed the way we live and understand the world. In the United States, it became an important part of everyday life, from science and technology to art and entertainment. Historians say that photography is the country's most significant contribution to the visual arts.
So, why was photography so popular? Firstly, it was a new technology that matched the country's enthusiasm for innovation. Just like the invention of the steam engine, railroads, and electricity, photography made it easier to communicate and travel. It brought the world to people's living rooms, making it feel more accessible and exciting.
Secondly, the camera was a way to capture a person's image and share it with others. In the United States, people believed that individuals and national identities were constantly changing and needed to be reinvented. Photography was a way to do this.
Thirdly, the camera helped people create and share memories of their families. It was a way to record their history and create a sense of identity.
Photographs are unique because they are a record of what was in front of the camera. They are objective, but also subjective, as they are taken by a person with their own perspective. This makes photography a universal language, but also complex, as the meaning of a photograph can change depending on the context in which it is seen.
Photography has become an essential part of art, and many artists use it in their work. In fact, it is now an integral part of how we understand representation in art.

William James, an American philosopher and doctor, defined psychology as the'science of mental life' in 1890. This definition is still helpful today. We all have a mental life, and we know what it means to some extent. However, it's difficult to understand because it can be studied in humans, animals, and even rats. James thought that human psychology is made up of basic things like thoughts, feelings, and a physical world. Each of us knows things through our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This knowledge is personal and private. We can make judgments about psychology using our own experiences, but this can be tricky. 
When we talk about complex psychological topics, like whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways, we are acting like amateur psychologists. However, this can lead to problems when people have different opinions. Professional psychologists try to find the most likely explanations for a situation. They help us distinguish between what is true and what is just our own opinion.
Psychologists don't fully understand how the brain works, so they study behavior instead. They make educated guesses about what's going on inside us based on what they observe. It's hard to study the brain directly, so they have to infer what's happening by looking at behavior. 
The goal of psychology is to understand the mind and behavior. It's like solving a crossword puzzle. Psychologists gather clues, analyze them, and make logical conclusions. They use scientific methods to study complex interactions and develop theories. Psychology can help us understand our experiences and make conclusions that can be applied to real life. It has helped us in many areas, such as teaching children to read, designing safer machines, and helping people who are upset. 
Psychologists have been studying psychology for about 150 years. Early psychologists tried to understand the mind by thinking about their own experiences. However, this had limitations. Today, psychologists prefer to study the behavior of others and base their theories on careful observations."

In a warehouse in Michigan, USA, there's a strange collection of products that didn't sell well. It's like a museum of failed products. The owner, Carol Sherry, thinks each product has its own sad story behind it. The most surprising thing is that this museum is a successful business. Many companies don't keep samples of their failed products, but the people who visit this museum are proof that it's not common.
The museum's owner, Robert McMath, started collecting products in the 1960s. He wanted a reference library of consumer products, not just failed ones. But, surprisingly, most of the products he collected didn't sell well. This is because most products fail. Today's culture is very focused on success, and companies often spend a lot of money on products that won't sell. They might even pretend that the product is still worth it, just to save face.
This focus on success is also seen in the self-help industry. Some people believe that if you imagine something will happen, it will. But a scientist named Tali Sharot has found that people tend to be too optimistic about their chances of success. In fact, people who are well-balanced might have a worse understanding of their abilities than those who are depressed.
A psychologist named Gabriele Oettingen has studied how thinking about the future affects people's motivation. She found that thinking about how well things could go actually makes people less motivated to achieve their goals. On the other hand, people who believe that ability can be developed through hard work and challenge are more likely to see failure as an opportunity to learn.
Psychologist Carol Dweck thinks that our experiences of failure depend on what we believe about ability. Some people think that ability is fixed and can't be changed, while others believe it can be developed. People who think ability is fixed are more likely to be upset by failure, while those who think it can be developed see failure as a chance to learn and grow."

Playing at home can give sports teams an advantage, but why is this? Some people think it's obvious, but things are changing in sports. Scientists and people who make money from sports are asking questions. They want to know what makes players play their best. Some scientists think that playing at home makes players feel more comfortable and confident. Others think that the crowd's noise and cheering can affect the referee's decisions.
In the past, playing at home was a big advantage. But now, with better travel and better hotels, it's not as big of an advantage. Some sports, like basketball, have a bigger home advantage than others, like baseball.
One reason for the home advantage might be that players feel more connected to their teammates when they play at home. They know each other's moves and can work together better. This makes them feel more confident and able to win.
Another reason might be that players feel a sense of pride and protection when they play at home. They want to defend their ""turf"" and win in front of their own fans. This can make them play more aggressively and try harder.
Some research has shown that players' testosterone levels are higher before home games. This could be because they feel a strong connection to their home stadium and want to defend it.
Overall, the home advantage is not just about the crowd or the players' comfort. It's about the team's connection and the players' sense of pride and protection."

Gary Player, a famous golfer, said ""The more I practice, the luckier I get."" But what did he really mean? He was being ironic, and his real message was ""The more I practice, the better I get."" But is this true? Can anyone become good at something just by practicing? Some people think so, but others disagree.
A psychologist named Anders Ericsson said that with 10,000 hours of practice, anyone can become an expert in any field. Many books have been written about this idea. However, a new book by Epstein argues that this is not always true. He says that scientists often only look at successful people and try to figure out why they are successful. But what about people who are not successful? What makes them different?
Epstein travels around the world to find answers. He talks to athletes, coaches, and even sled dogs! He learns that sometimes, people's natural abilities can affect their success. For example, some people might be naturally good at sports, and no amount of practice can change that. Epstein also looks at how gender and race affect athletic performance. He asks questions like ""If practice is the only thing that matters, then why do we separate men and women in sports?""

Here is a simplified version of the text at the B1 level:
Many children in wealthy countries feel unhappy and lonely. A book by Jay Griffiths says that this is because they spend too much time indoors, staring at screens, and don't get to spend time in nature. She thinks this is the main problem. This idea is similar to what other experts have said about childhood.
A study talked to some children to learn more about why they are unhappy. The children didn't say they wanted more gadgets; many said they would be happier if they could go outside more. Many adults also remember their own childhoods fondly, saying they had more freedom and spent more time playing outside. However, they didn't think about how they are now protecting their own children, keeping them safe and indoors.
Jay Griffiths' book has some good points. She talks about how parents' fears for their children's safety are used to sell toys and games to keep them indoors. She also writes about how some schools are prescribing medicine for children who are restless, or making them wear goggles for playground games.
Griffiths is passionate about giving children more freedom and allowing them to take risks. She thinks children need to experience some danger to learn how to manage it. However, she doesn't say how we can achieve this. Some people might also wonder if all children want to be free and take risks, or if some prefer to stay safe and calm.

I'm a psychologist who studies how children learn and grow. I believe that school doesn't always teach the most important skills. Most problems in life can't be solved with formulas or memorized answers. They require good judgment, wisdom, and creativity. These skills come from life experiences, especially play.
All mammals, including humans, play when they're young. Children play more than any other young animals because they have the most to learn. Play helps children develop important skills like thinking creatively, getting along with others, and controlling their emotions.
These skills can't be taught in school. They are learned through play. Children need to play freely to develop these skills. Adults, including geniuses, retain their playful minds and creativity throughout their lives.
Unfortunately, schools have become too focused on rules and grades. Children don't have as much free time to play as they used to. We need to give children more freedom to play and explore so they can grow into strong, confident adults.

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to look for a job. Sites like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect with potential employers directly. However, this also means they can make mistakes. A young job seeker in the US contacted a marketing executive on LinkedIn, thinking she could help him get a job. But the executive was angry and sent a harsh rejection message that went viral. This incident shows that social media can be a dangerous tool for job hunters who don't know how to use it.
For many young people, social media is a part of their daily life. They use it to connect with friends and family, share photos and updates, and show off their interests. But when it comes to using social media for professional networking, it's different. It's not just about being popular or having a lot of friends; it's about being professional and respectful.
Some young people may not understand this difference. They may think that because they have a lot of friends on Facebook, they can just send a message to someone they don't know and expect a response. But this is not how it works. When using social media for professional networking, you need to be clear about who you are and what you can offer. You should also be humble and respectful in your approach.
Employers often complain that young job seekers on professional networking sites come across as arrogant or over-familiar. This can hurt their chances of getting a job. To avoid this, it's important to be professional and respectful in your online interactions. Remember, social media can be a great way to make useful contacts, but it needs to be used carefully.

In the US, a research centre says that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26% of people, compared to 45% in 2001. Some people think that newspapers will disappear in the next 15 years. However, old media have a habit of surviving. For example, theatre survived the newspaper, cinema, and television. Radio and vinyl records have also made a comeback.
Newspapers were once new media, and it took time for them to become popular. This was because producing news for a large number of people over a wide area was difficult and expensive until the 19th century. People used to think that everything stays the same, but now we expect change. In the past, people only needed news when something big happened, like a famine or a flood.
Journalism as a job is a recent development. Before the 19th century, people didn't need news on a regular basis. Now, with the internet, we can get news whenever we want and personalize it to our interests. We can also correct mistakes quickly and access documents easily. However, many news providers focus on being the first to break the news and creating drama, rather than helping us understand the world.
Perhaps newspapers will disappear, or perhaps they will find a new way to guide us to wisdom and understanding in this chaotic world."

If humans were meant to live in the dark, we would be happy to go without light at night. But we're not nocturnal creatures. Our eyes are adapted to see in the daylight. This is something that is deeply ingrained in our genes. We don't often think about it, but it's the reason we've changed the night. We've filled it with light. This is like controlling a river. It has its benefits, but it also has negative effects, known as light pollution. Light pollution is caused by bad lighting design. It shines too much light into the sky, which is not what we need. This washes out the natural darkness and affects many living things, including us.
In the past, people didn't have as much light pollution. Imagine walking in London at night in the 1800s. It was a much darker city. Most people used candles, torches, and lanterns for light. Only a few houses had gas lights, and there were no streetlights. From far away, you would have smelled the city more than seen it. We've lit up the night like it's an empty country, but it's not. Many animals are nocturnal, and light is important to them. Some birds are even attracted to artificial light and can get trapped. Light pollution can also affect our bodies. We need darkness to stay healthy. It's as important as light is. If we don't get enough darkness, we can get sick. Our bodies are used to the natural rhythm of day and night, and messing with that can cause problems. We've lost our connection to the natural world and our place in the universe. We've forgotten how small we are compared to the stars and the Milky Way.

A big company has decided not to keep track of how many holidays its employees take. The idea came from an email from the company's founder's daughter. She wrote that she likes to take as many holidays as she wants and never worries about the work. The company's founder thinks this is a good idea, but some people are not so sure.
The problem is that the company is very big and has many different departments. It's hard to know if taking a holiday will affect the work. The founder says that employees can take as many holidays as they want as long as they make sure their work is done. But it's hard to be sure that everything is okay before you go on holiday. And even if you try to tie up all the loose ends, there is always more work to come back to.
Taking too many holidays can make people feel guilty and stressed. They might feel like they are not doing their job properly. And if everyone takes holidays at the same time, it could cause problems for the company. Some people might not take holidays at all, or they might only take them when they really need to.
The company's founder thinks that this policy will make people more productive and happy. But some people are not convinced. They think that having unlimited holidays is not a good idea and that it could cause more problems than it solves.

'Scientific research papers are reviewed by other experts in the same field before they are published. This is meant to ensure that the papers are accurate and reliable. However, this process can take a long time - up to a year. Some people think that this is a good price to pay for trustworthiness, but others disagree.
The way research is published is changing. Some scientists are now posting their papers online before they are reviewed. This is called a preprint. This way, other scientists can read and comment on the paper quickly, and the author can make changes before it is officially published.
The current system of publishing research papers has some problems. Some scientists are more interested in getting their work published in a famous journal than in sharing their findings with others. This can lead to mistakes and biases in the research. The reviewers also have a hard time doing their job because they have to decide not only if the paper is good, but also if it is good enough for a specific journal.
Some scientists think that preprints could be a solution to these problems. They allow for quick sharing and discussion of research, and the author can still publish the paper in a journal later. This way, the focus is on the research itself, not where it is published.
A professor of psychology agrees. She posted a paper that criticized another paper, and she was able to get feedback from many scientists. She thinks that preprints could help to make the scientific process more open and transparent.'
I minimized changes to the factual content while simplifying the language and structure to make it more accessible to a B1 level learner. I also removed some technical terms and jargon to make it easier to understand."

When I ask my students what a poem is, they often say it's a 'painting with words'. But I'm not satisfied with their answers. So, I asked them to write two paragraphs about an object. The first paragraph should describe the object in a scientific way, like a scientist would. The second paragraph should be from the point of view of the object itself, and should be titled 'Poem'. One student wrote about an oxygen mask, which is not a typical choice. This helped us understand how poetry is unique.
When I was at school, I didn't understand poetry. I thought it was confusing and got in the way of understanding and feeling. After school, people rarely read poetry because it's not like other writing. Poetry is different from prose because it's short and often doesn't make sense at first. But we still try to read it because we want to find deep feelings, beautiful images, or clever ideas. We look for poems to be emotional, beautiful, or funny. But we can find these things in other things too, like films, articles, or music.
So, what is a poem? Some people think it's like a machine or a wild animal. But these comparisons don't work well. Instead, trying to define a poem makes us think about what we mean by machine or wild animal. Poetry is like a special object that can change our minds and make us see things in a new way. It's like a song that gets stuck in our heads. A poem can be powerful, even though it's just words on a page. It's different from other writing because it's not meant to be a commodity. It's a product of writing and rewriting, but it's unique and special."

I bought my first metal detector after I got married. It was a lot of money, but my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring on my first outing. Over the years, I've found many other things that have given me pleasure. But it wasn't until 40 years later that I made another discovery that impressed Marion as much as the gold ring. It was a rainy day and I had a few hours to spare. I decided to search a spot I knew that had old farming equipment. My metal detector beeped, and I dug down half a meter to find a golden ball. As I brushed away the dirt, it became clear that it was a beautiful, intricately patterned loop. I knew it was something special. It was the Great Torc, a famous necklace from over 2,000 years ago. I took it home and showed it to Marion. We were both very excited. We knew we had to report it to the authorities, so I took it to the council office. They authenticated it and sold it to the British Museum. The money we got was split between the owner of the field and me. The torc is now in the British Museum in London. People ask me if I'm going to stop detecting now that I've made such a big find. But I love finding things, and I'll keep doing it as long as I can."

When I travel, I love sleeping. But I don't talk about it much because I feel a little guilty. When my friends tell me about their busy trips, with lots of planned activities, I smile and don't say much. But my own travel plans include taking long naps in the afternoon and sleeping in late in the morning. I think that's one of the best things about traveling.
I remember when I went to Mexico's Yucatán coast when I was in my early 20s. I slept a lot, over 12 hours a day. It was nice to sleep so much, even with noisy birds outside my window. I felt relaxed and my sleep was very good.
I think sleep is an important part of traveling. When we travel, we see and experience new things, and our sleep helps us process all those new things. Sleep is also different in different places. For example, when I went to Trinidad, people woke up early, slept a lot in the middle of the day, and then went out again in the evening. It took me a few days to get used to this new sleep pattern.
I also like sleeping in new places because I remember my dreams and the sounds and smells of the place. It's like I'm still experiencing the place even when I'm asleep. Some people think that sleeping is a waste of time, but I think it's an important part of traveling.
I'm going to stop feeling guilty about sleeping a lot when I travel. I'll tell my friends that sleeping is an important part of enjoying my trips."

Lawrence Okoye is a 21-year-old from London who has had an amazing journey in sports. He went from competing in the Olympic discus final to trying out for an American football team. He's never played American football before, but he's doing well and might be picked for a top team.
Lawrence is still learning about his new position and what he needs to do. He's never played American football before, but he's good at it. He was ranked the world's fourth-best discus-thrower just 20 months after starting to train.
Lawrence went to Atlanta for warm-weather discus training, but he also thought about playing American football. He applied to the NFL trials in Atlanta, even though he had never played the game before. He didn't get nervous, even when he was competing against men who had been playing the game their whole lives.
Lawrence did well in the tests and drills and was picked out as the most impressive player. He's not sure if he'll be selected, but he's not worried. He's used to people saying he's good at things, and he knows that hard work will help him succeed.
Lawrence has had some setbacks, like coming last in the Olympic discus final. But he's moved on and is focusing on his new goal. He's not worried about the money he could make as an NFL player - over $400,000 a year - because he knows he can always go back to the discus if it doesn't work out.
Lawrence thinks it's okay to try new things and take risks. He's always been a bit of a risk-taker, and he's happy to see where this new journey takes him."

I woke up on the plane and looked out the window. I saw a vast, empty landscape with brown and green colors. It was September, but it was still not autumn in Siberia. I saw no signs of people and the view went on forever. I shook my head. My neighbor, Sergei, woke up and smiled at me. He was a salesman from Moscow who was going to sell safety clothes to mining companies in a very remote area. He spoke little English, but we used a dictionary to talk. I told him I was going to Magadan, a city in eastern Siberia, but I only had a one-way ticket. I wanted to ride my bike back to England. Sergei was surprised. 'But there's no road from Magadan,' he said. I told him I thought there was a road, but not many people used it. He asked if I was going alone. I said yes, but I would have a friend, Al, with me. Sergei looked unsure. I showed him my warm clothes and told him I was prepared for the cold. But I didn't mention that I was on a tight budget. I had bought most of my clothes and equipment cheaply. I wasn't sure if they would be good enough.
I had met Al in a lecture hall in Scotland. The room was full of students, but they were all tired. Our teacher was talking, but I was thinking about a problem. Should I ask him something or not? I wrote a note to Al, asking if he wanted to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China. He said yes. It was six years later that I was going to join Al in Siberia. I was a geography teacher, but I was still learning. I had two long holidays a year, which I used to go on adventures. I had met Al twice before, and he had become more adventurous. He had decided to cycle around the world. He was setting himself big challenges and overcoming them. I envied him because he was having an amazing adventure and proving that he could do things that seemed impossible."

The Red Bull Air Race is a competition where 12 pilots fly their planes through a course with tall pylons. They go fast - up to 370 km per hour! I got to try it out. Before the flight, I had to sign two forms and promise to stay calm and focused. I also had to promise to relax when I was flying upside down and enjoy the view.
When we were ready to take off, I felt a bit nervous. The pilot, Dario, told me to keep my eyes on the horizon and not touch anything. But I was worried and my mind was racing. It's hard to relax when you're flying so fast and doing crazy turns and loops.
As we took off, Dario banked the plane sharply to the right. I felt my stomach drop and my heart race. We flew upside down and I felt like I was going to pass out. But Dario told me to relax and look up. I saw some fields below and felt a bit better.
After 10 minutes, the flight was over. It was a lot of fun, but also a bit scary. Dario said it was a ""soft"" flight compared to what the real pilots do in the competition. He even ate a sandwich after we landed! I didn't eat for hours and that night I had a hard time sleeping because I kept thinking about the flight."

Doug Allan films animals in cold places. He's a famous wildlife cameraman who has worked on many TV shows. He loves extreme cold temperatures, like -18°C. Doug used to be a marine biologist and commercial diver. He learned how to survive in cold places while diving.
Doug's big break came when a TV crew asked him to help them film a documentary in Antarctica. He loved being a wildlife cameraman because it combined his passions for travel, adventure, and the underwater world.
When Doug started out, not many people had filmed in Antarctica before. He became known as the ""cold man"" and got to capture amazing footage of polar bears and other animals.
The technology for filming was very basic when Doug started 35 years ago. It's much easier now, with digital cameras and editing software. Doug says that in the past, you had to plan carefully and shoot less because film was expensive.
Doug has a lot of experience filming in cold places and knows how to stay safe. He's filmed in places with no mosquitoes, no diseases, and no leeches. He loves the Arctic and has spent a lot of time on sea ice.
Wildlife filming can be challenging, with many failures and embarrassments. Doug once got confused about the type of birds he was filming. Recently, he spent 23 days filming polar bears in the Arctic, but only saw one mother bear and her cub. On the 24th day, he finally got some amazing footage of a polar bear.
Doug wants to make a new documentary about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and showing the impact of climate change on their lives. He thinks he could make an incredible documentary.

Pen Hadow is a brave and adventurous person. In 2004, he became the first person to walk to the North Pole alone. He had to swim in very cold water, fight against frostbite, and protect himself from polar bears. Just eight months later, he walked to the South Pole too. Now, he is going back to the Arctic again for an even bigger adventure.
This time, Pen will walk 1,000 kilometers to the North Pole with two friends. They will take measurements of the ice to help scientists understand how global warming is affecting the polar region. This will be the most accurate picture of what is happening to the ice.
Pen was trained to be brave and strong as a child. His father's old nanny, who used to work with a famous explorer, would send him out into the cold and snow with almost no clothes on. Pen's father loved adventure, and Pen grew up to be very strong and able to handle the cold.
Pen is married to Mary, who is also very adventurous. She loves horses and helps Pen with his polar guide business. Pen is worried about being away from his family this time because he knows his children are growing up and he doesn't want to miss important moments.
Pen and his team will be in the Arctic for three months. They will be supported by a group of six people who will bring them supplies. Pen is feeling a bit nervous because he knows this will be a big challenge. He is also worried about being 47 years old and not feeling as fit as he used to be.
Pen believes that his mission is important because it will help scientists understand the impact of global warming on the Arctic. He thinks that his skills as an explorer are now more important than ever, and he is excited to be able to make a difference."

I took a break from being an Olympic athlete. I wanted to do different things, like writing and TV work, and talk to businesses and schools. But I missed the excitement of competing. I decided to enter marathons and triathlons to stay in shape. Then, I received an invitation to row across the Atlantic with a TV presenter named Ben Fogle. I loved rowing and missed the feeling of gliding on the water. I asked some of my rowing friends if they wanted to join the race, but they weren't interested. I thought about joining the race with Ben, but I knew it would be hard to win with him. However, I also thought it would be fun to be the underdog and not have any pressure.
Ben had already paid for the boat and equipment, which cost £70,000. We talked about the costs and how we could make it work. I also had to think about the money I would lose by being away from home for a while. As a retired athlete, I make money by speaking at business conferences, but I find it hard to talk about my past achievements without having a new goal. Rowing across the Atlantic would be a new challenge and something I could talk about.
I learned a lot while preparing for the race, but one thing I realized was to appreciate the easy life I had as a full-time athlete. My training was tough, but it was planned and I had support from doctors and dieticians. I was worried about people's reaction to me racing with a TV presenter, but my concerns went away as we prepared. The Atlantic Rowing Race is not just about rowing; it's also about mental toughness. Ben had done some tough challenges before, but he didn't have much experience with rowing. I had to be patient and help him improve, but I should have realized he would need a lot of help when I agreed to race with him."

I left my job in London and moved to Finland to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle. I was 26 years old and wanted to escape the noise and crowds of the city. I found a company in Finnish Lapland that takes tourists on dog sled rides through the snow and ice. They had six dogs at first, but soon had over 100. I could join the team for three months, but they warned me that the work would be hard and the conditions would be tough.
I flew to Finland and was given a list of 100 husky names to memorize. I was feeling stressed and overwhelmed, so I looked out the window instead. On the bus ride to the farm, I saw dark forests and snow-covered trees. When I arrived, I was given a pair of boots and told to go outside. The dogs were excited and barking loudly. I followed the sound and saw people harnessing the dogs to sleds. I was told to get in and we set off into the dark.
It didn't take long to learn how to drive the sled, but I struggled with simple tasks like feeding and watering the dogs. It was hard to do these tasks in the cold weather, and I had to make a special soup for the dogs because their water would freeze. After my first week, my head was spinning with instructions and my muscles were sore from carrying heavy sleds. But I was proud of myself for learning new skills, like chopping wood and using a circular saw, in the snow.

They asked her about a special oil, emu oil, that helped her heal from an injury. Radcliffe got hurt when she accidentally ran into a bike while training. Olympic champion Cathy Freeman recommended the oil.

Radcliffe's physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann, worked with her for weeks, helping her recover from her injuries. He said she was one of the most dedicated athletes he had ever worked with.

When I first made my cooking show ""In Search of Perfection"", I was worried about how people would react. I thought that my approach to cooking, which included history, nostalgia, and science, might be too different from what people were used to. But my fears were unfounded. The show was a success, and it led to many other exciting projects, including a book about my restaurant.
In each of my projects, I like to think of myself as going on a journey, whether it's into the past, into people's minds, or into cooking techniques. I wrote several books called ""Perfection"", each one linked to a TV show of the same name. These books took me on a journey around the world, meeting people who are passionate about their work, like a man who makes the best pasta in the world.
Perfection is a personal thing, and it's hard to agree on what it means. Even choosing which dishes to include in my show was a challenge. Some people might ask, ""Where's steak and kidney pie?"" But after a long meeting, my team and I came up with a list that everyone could enjoy.
I believe that perfection is a mix of emotions, memories, and surroundings. My book isn't about claiming that my recipes are the best, but about understanding what makes them work. The TV show gave me the chance to try new foods, meet new people, and explore my own memories and nostalgia. I was excited to search for the best ingredients and try out new techniques, like making ice cream from scratch or cooking chicken in a hospital machine."

'No, we can't stay here forever,' I repeated, because I didn't want to upset Bea.
We got back into the van and waited for John to find someone who knew how to fix the car. Mum lay down on the grass and asked me to tell her a story.

'My dad said I spend too much time online and should get out more. I decided to look at what experts say. Most teenagers who use social media have many friends, a good sense of who they are, and learn important technical skills. Simon Miles, an expert on online safety, says social media is a normal part of modern life for teenagers. It's not good or bad, it just depends on how you use it.
Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says social media is like a virtual youth club. It helps teenagers make friends, share jokes, and talk about their interests. It's a way for them to develop their identity and learn to deal with problems.
Psychologist Professor Keith Davidson says social media can help teenagers find their identity. They can share their interests and see that others have different opinions. Research shows that people who use social media a lot are not as selfish as those who don't.
Professor Andrew Phillips says social media can be helpful for quiet people who have special interests. They can connect with others who like the same things. Pauline White, an expert on digital education, says teenagers can use social media to find new interests, join groups, and create their own content. This can help them in their future careers.
She thinks social media is becoming a creative force. Teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about things they like. They can share photos and learn from others. This can help them in the workplace. Every business uses social media to sell and promote their brand, so it's important to understand how it works.'

We visited Yellowstone National Park and saw bears and other wildlife. We had to wait for them to cross the road, and we even had a close encounter with a bear. We stayed in a old hotel with no internet or phone signal, but it was worth it for the amazing views. After a rainstorm, we headed back south.

Charlotte's book talks about big questions and important issues, but she doesn't think she's wise because of her age. She just wanted to explore the idea of taking responsibility.
Charlotte didn't like reading books about teenagers that made them seem weak or stupid. She wanted to write about someone who is fine, not someone who is struggling. She thinks some writers make teenagers feel like they're not good enough because they're not experienced enough.

She did find a helpful book called How Not to Write a Novel, which told her to make sure the reader doesn't guess what's going to happen.

Gareth said, ""Speed is an unpredictable beast."" I wasn't sure if I was good enough for this. On our previous skiing holidays, I liked doing simple turns in the snow. I didn't think I was good enough to do the tricks that teenagers do on ramps and half pipes.
My parents decided we would go to a special ski centre in the US where we could learn freestyle skiing. The centre had a big indoor area with trampolines and ski jumps covered in artificial snow. Students would jump and try new tricks, then land in foam cubes. After practicing indoors, we went outside to try it for real. Gareth told us, ""Progression is inevitable!"" He said that before, people would just try the jumps and hope for the best, but now we can learn to control our movements.
I found it hard to go fast enough to jump properly. My legs would stop moving when I got close to the jump, so I would fall. Gareth told us, ""You need to control the jump, not let it control you."" On the second day, we practiced on the trampolines. I thought I would hate being indoors, but bouncing on the trampolines was fun. We did some exercises to help us control our movements in the air. Gareth gave us feedback and told us to work on our ""aerial awareness"". I didn't do very well, but I tried again and again. Finally, I landed properly! Gareth was happy, and I felt proud. But then, on the last run of the day, I lost my skis again.'"

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your hands are sweaty and your nails are digging into the safety harness. The ride comes to a stop and then slowly moves upwards. Then, suddenly, it drops and you feel like your stomach is in the air. You might even let out a loud scream. But you chose to ride the rollercoaster, just like millions of other people each year.
It's surprising that amusement parks are so popular, with their scary rides designed to attract crowds. Behind the scenes, there are many experts working together to create the perfect thrill. These experts include engineers, designers, and marketing specialists.
Being a rollercoaster designer might sound like a dream job for a child, but it's actually a big challenge. They need to balance the thrill of the ride with safety, and make sure it's exciting enough to keep visitors coming back. Many people think that rollercoasters have become more intense over time, but most of the techniques used today were invented a long time ago.
I spoke to three experts who work on rollercoasters. They told me that the key to creating a great ride is to make it feel like you're being thrown around, but still feel safe. It's a delicate balance between thrill and safety.
To create the best ride, the teams behind rollercoasters need to come up with a strong storyline, like a space adventure or a jungle chase. They use this storyline to combine different features, like steep drops and sharp turns, to create a seamless experience. However, the experts said that gut instinct, experience, and trial-and-error are what really work.
They also mentioned that being a thrill-seeker can be helpful when designing rollercoasters, as it allows you to understand what passengers want and to test the rides before they open to the public. Some people might think that new technology, like virtual reality, will change the way rollercoasters are designed. However, the experts said that the physical experience of riding a rollercoaster will remain the most important part for many years to come."

Miranda Ellington is a successful choreographer who is 25 years old. She has worked with many theaters and dance companies. She still likes to dance sometimes, even though it's hard to fit it into her busy schedule. As a choreographer, she teaches dance to students and enjoys working with them because they are open to new ideas and willing to take risks.
When Miranda starts working with a new group, she focuses on the dance steps and the music. She has to make sure the dance routine fits the music, even if she doesn't like the music. Sometimes, dancers don't like the music either, but Miranda has to find a solution.
Miranda doesn't like to work with just one company or institution. She likes to work with different people and adapt her style to fit each new group. This means she doesn't get too used to doing things one way and can stay creative.
Miranda thinks that a great dance production is when everything comes together - the music, costumes, lighting, and dancers. It's not always perfect, but aiming high is important. She has worked on productions where something was wrong, like the costumes or props, and that was disappointing.
Some people want to label Miranda as a modern dance choreographer or a ballet specialist, but she doesn't like that. She wants to keep trying new things and not specialize in just one area.
