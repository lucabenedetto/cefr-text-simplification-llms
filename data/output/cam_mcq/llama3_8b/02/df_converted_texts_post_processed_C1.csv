Some years ago, a website highlighted the risks of sharing our whereabouts online. The site argued that when we post about our whereabouts, we're not just sharing with friends and family, but also with strangers who might not be people we'd like to meet. This idea fits with the growing awareness that social media can have negative consequences. We're tempted to share every aspect of our lives with a potentially global audience, but we often realize too late that the online world is crowded and unpredictable.
However, there are lessons to be learned from those who have been there before us. In the early days of the internet, a group of pioneers, now known as bloggers, explored these waters and encountered many challenges. They lost friends, faced fame and its temptations, and navigated the risks of sharing their personal lives online. Before we follow in their footsteps, it's worth taking a look at their stories.
In 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting his life online. He shared his thoughts, photos, and art, and people were fascinated by his honesty. But when he fell in love and wrote about it online, his partner asked him to choose between his blog and their relationship. Hall's story is a reminder that sharing our lives online can have consequences.
Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, wrote about her job and her personal life. However, when an anonymous colleague shared her blog with her bosses, she lost her job. This is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" where we feel we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But the web is not a separate reality where we can be anonymous. Our online and offline lives are connected, and we need to be careful about what we share.
Heather Armstrong's story has a happy ending. She learned to manage her online presence and is now a successful blogger and mother. Her experience teaches us that while the web allows us to share our thoughts and feelings, we should think carefully about the consequences of our online actions."

A few years ago, some scientists started warning people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? The film combined documentary and drama to show that there is still much we don't understand about our universe. While it's true that scientists can be a bit arrogant, even the most confident physicist wouldn't claim to know everything. Despite this, some scientists felt compelled to issue public warnings, describing the film as ""atrocious"" or ""dangerous"". This sparked my curiosity, and I had to see the movie for myself.
For the first 20 minutes, I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. Scientists were simply stating that new discoveries were revealing the universe to be stranger than expected. However, when the film discussed these discoveries, I started to understand the fuss. One example was the ability of water molecules to be affected by thought. I had heard rumors about a Japanese researcher who had shown that the shape of a water molecule could change dramatically just by the thoughts of those around it. The film presented some pictures of ice crystals that looked nice when someone was happy and nasty when someone was in a bad mood. While many people find this kind of evidence compelling, scientists were skeptical. They wanted more concrete proof that the effect was real.
The problem was that the film's claims weren't bizarre enough. For instance, water molecules owe their properties to a form of energy that appears out of nowhere, linked to a force driving the expansion of the universe. This is supported by decades of research in laboratories and observatories worldwide. In reality, discoveries are being made that prove the universe is stranger than anyone could have imagined. Astronomers have found that the universe is made up of unknown matter and propelled by a mysterious force called ""dark energy"". On a more down-to-earth level, neuroscientists have found evidence that our conscious perception of events lags behind reality by half a second, which is edited out by our brains. Anthropologists have identified the birthplace of modern humans and how they left to populate the world. Some theorists have even linked the existence of life on Earth to the fundamental design of the universe.
Despite what some might believe, science is not complete. In fact, we are further away from omniscience than ever. Many natural phenomena can never be fully understood, and the concepts of chaos and quantum uncertainty have set limits on what we can know. Some leading theoretical physicists are working on the Theory of Everything, which will summarize all the forces and particles of the universe in a single equation. In the end, many of us believe the universe is best described in one word: incredible."

Writing novels and short stories are two different experiences for me. Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is like tending a garden. Both processes are essential to my writing career. I alternate between writing novels and short stories, never doing both at the same time. This helps me switch between different mental gears and avoid burnout.
I started writing short stories later in my career, in the 1980s. It was a challenging but rewarding experience. I found that short stories allowed me to explore new ideas and experiment with different styles. Readers seemed to appreciate this new side of me as a writer.
One of the advantages of writing short stories is that they are quicker to complete. I can finish a short story in about a week, whereas novels take months or even years. This flexibility is essential for me, as it allows me to take a break from the intense focus required for novel-writing.
I also enjoy the freedom to explore small, everyday ideas in short stories. It's like jazz improvisation, where the story takes shape as I write. And if a story doesn't work out, I don't worry about it. I can learn from the experience and try again.
In fact, short stories serve as a kind of experimental laboratory for me as a novelist. I can try out new ideas and techniques without committing to a full-length novel. Without short stories, I would find it harder to write novels, as I would be stuck in one mode for too long.
My short stories are like personal markers, left behind in the world. I remember exactly where I wrote each one and how I felt when I did. They are a way for me to share my inner thoughts and emotions with readers, and it brings me joy as a writer."

Science is a vast and complex field that has both fascinated and threatened humanity. It has made our lives easier and more comfortable, but it has also led to conflicts and controversies. Scientists have always struggled to understand the universe and its many mysteries, from the smallest atoms to the vastness of space. They have developed theories and ideas that have changed the way we think about the world and our place in it.
Despite its importance, science is not without its limitations and flaws. Scientists are human, and their work is subject to errors and biases. Theories are often challenged and replaced by new discoveries, and the history of science is marked by controversy and debate. However, this struggle for knowledge has led to significant advances in our understanding of the world and our ability to predict and manipulate it.
Science is not just about discovering new things; it is also about applying what we know to improve our lives. In the past, science has helped us develop new technologies, cure diseases, and improve our understanding of the world. Today, scientists are working on some of the biggest challenges facing humanity, from climate change to the search for a cure for cancer.
As science continues to evolve, it is essential that we, as a society, understand its importance and its limitations. Non-scientists need to be aware of the implications of scientific discoveries and the potential risks and benefits of new technologies. By engaging with science and its applications, we can work together to shape a better future for ourselves and for future generations.

For several years, ebook sales had been growing rapidly. However, around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales had plateaued or even decreased in some cases. This led to concerns about the long-term viability of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some publishing executives admitted that the hype around ebooks might have led to overinvestment, causing them to lose faith in the power of physical books. Despite the evidence suggesting that digital and print can coexist, the debate about whether ebooks will replace print books continues. This debate is not just about predicting the future, but also about our emotional attachment to books and the fear of change.
The idea of a new technology replacing an old one is not new. In the past, critics have predicted the demise of various media, such as radio and television, but they have ultimately coexisted with new technologies. We develop emotional bonds with different media, and the emergence of a new technology forces us to adjust to change. As a result, we often nostalgically look back at what we used to have, which can lead to the development of industries around retro products.
The spread of the printing press, for example, led people to seek out original manuscripts, while the shift from silent to sound movies created nostalgia for the older form. Similarly, the transition from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs sparked a new appreciation for the material quality of older products. The rise of e-readers has led to a renewed appreciation for the physical quality of printed books, including their distinctive smell.
While the idea of the disappearing book may be unsettling, it is a narrative that reflects both our excitement about new technologies and our fear of change. We often use familiar narrative patterns, such as the story of tragedy and ending, to make sense of change. The story of the death of the book is a reminder of our attachment to what we have and our fear of losing parts of our lives."

I spent almost a year and a half every weekday morning, waking up at 5:30, brushing my teeth, making coffee, and writing about how some of the most brilliant people of the past 400 years managed to do their best work. I focused on the daily routines of famous thinkers, writers, and artists, including when they slept, ate, worked, and worried. By exploring these everyday habits, I aimed to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers. 
The idea is that our daily routines reveal our true nature. As the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me how you spend your time, and I'll tell you what you're like."" This book is about the daily habits of creative people, not just their final products. It's about how they managed their time and energy to produce great work.
My own struggles with balancing creative work and making a living are reflected in this book. I wanted to know how others dealt with similar challenges. How do you find the time to do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Should you dedicate yourself fully to a project or set aside time each day for it? When there's not enough time for everything, do you have to give something up, or can you learn to be more efficient?
I don't claim to have the answers in this book, but I've gathered examples of how successful people have tackled these issues. I wanted to show how grand ideas can be broken down into small, daily tasks, and how our daily routines can influence our work and vice versa.
The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but my focus is really on people's routines. The word ""routine"" often implies a lack of thought or creativity, but in the right hands, it can be a powerful tool for making the most of limited resources, such as time, willpower, and optimism.
I stumbled upon this idea by accident. One Sunday afternoon, I was supposed to write an article, but instead, I spent the day tidying my office and making coffee. I'm a morning person, but after lunch, I lose focus. That day, I started researching how other writers worked, and it led to the idea of creating a blog and eventually this book. The book is a collection of daily routines from various sources, including biographies, interviews, and letters. I've tried to let the individuals speak for themselves, using their own words whenever possible."

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a C1 learner:
One of the most significant developments in higher education over the past few years is the emphasis on involving students in research from an early stage. This recognizes that research is not just for renowned scholars or scientists, but a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills will be valuable not only in your studies but also in your future career, as they involve critical thinking and problem-solving.
As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions and seeking answers. You don't just absorb information; you create it. Making knowledge involves asking questions like ""Why?"", ""How?"", and ""What if?"" instead of simply accepting what you're told. These questions are at the heart of research.
Research can take many forms, from groundbreaking, complex projects to everyday investigations. At its core, research is about asking thoughtful questions, exploring problems, and seeking answers. You've likely been conducting research in some form since you started studying or working. For example, you may have researched where to go on holiday, how to fix a problem, or how to choose the right product online.
In higher education, it's expected that you'll develop your research skills by questioning established knowledge, evaluating information, and constructing your own responses. Some students may struggle with this, as they may be used to accepting what they're told by authorities. However, in UK, US, European, and Australasian higher education, it's encouraged to question established knowledge and authorities.
Critical thinking is essential in research. While it's important to consider the research of others, you need to engage with it, think critically, and evaluate the evidence. Don't just accept what you're told; instead, test ideas, identify potential biases, and consider alternative perspectives.

Cities have long been hubs of intellectual activity, from 18th-century coffeehouses in London to modern-day cafes in Paris, where artists like Pablo Picasso would discuss their work. However, city life is not without its challenges. The same cafes that sparked lively discussions also spread diseases like cholera, and even Picasso eventually left the city to live in the countryside. Despite its creative potential, the modern city can be an overwhelming and unnatural environment. Scientists have started to study how cities affect our brains, and the results are surprising. While it's well-known that city life can be exhausting, research suggests that cities can actually dull our thinking, sometimes significantly. One key factor is the lack of nature. Studies have shown that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief glimpses of nature can improve cognitive performance, as they provide a mental break from the urban routine.
As humans have become increasingly urbanized, with the majority now living in cities, it's essential to understand the impact of this environment on our mental and physical health. The constant stimuli in cities can be mentally draining, as our brains need to constantly redirect our attention. This is because cities are overcrowded and noisy, with many distractions competing for our attention. In contrast, natural settings don't require as much mental effort, as they provide a sense of calm and relaxation.
The concept of attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan, suggests that immersion in nature can have a restorative effect on our minds. Natural environments are full of objects that capture our attention, but they don't trigger negative emotions, allowing our mental machinery to relax and replenish itself.
Despite the challenges posed by city life, cities continue to thrive as hubs of intellectual activity. Research has shown that the very same features that can trigger lapses in attention and memory – crowded streets and close proximity to others – also contribute to urban creativity. The concentration of social interactions is what drives innovation, as seen in cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is a hotbed of technological innovation. The key is to find a balance between the benefits of city life and the need for mental relaxation and restoration.

The question of where the mind is located is an interesting one. Many people assume that thinking takes place inside our heads, and modern brain imaging techniques have confirmed this. However, I believe that the study of the mind should not stop at the skin or skull. There is a wealth of evidence from archaeology that shows that objects, as well as neurons, play a crucial role in human cognitive life. From ancient times to the present, humans have used tools, symbols, and other objects to help us think and make sense of the world.
It's easy to see why the mind and brain are often equated, as most research has focused on isolating people from their surroundings to study their brains. However, this approach overlooks the fact that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads. I'm not questioning the importance of the brain, but rather suggesting that the mind is more than just the brain.
Instead, I propose that human intelligence extends beyond the skin into the material world. This is the idea behind my theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET explores how objects become extensions of our bodies and minds, and how this has changed over time. It also looks at how these changes have shaped the way we think.
For example, consider a blind person using a stick to navigate. Where does their sense of self begin and end? The stick becomes an extension of their body, and their brain treats it as part of themselves. This example illustrates the plasticity of the human mind, which is capable of reorganizing itself in response to new experiences and technologies.
My approach sees the human mind as an ongoing project, constantly evolving and changing as we interact with the world around us. This is what I call metaplasticity – our minds are shaped by the material world, and we, in turn, shape the world through our creations.
I believe that it's time to recognize the importance of material culture in shaping our minds and thoughts. By incorporating materiality into our understanding of cognition, we can gain a deeper understanding of how humans have used technology to transform themselves and their environment throughout history."
