Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Some years ago, a website highlighted the risks of sharing our whereabouts online. The site argued that when we post about our whereabouts, we're not just sharing with friends and family, but also with strangers who might not be people we'd like to meet. This idea fits with the growing awareness that social media can have negative consequences. We're tempted to share every aspect of our lives with a potentially global audience, but we often realize too late that the online world is crowded and unpredictable.

However, there are lessons to be learned from those who have been there before us. In the early days of the internet, a group of pioneers, now known as bloggers, explored these waters and encountered many challenges. They lost friends, faced fame and its temptations, and navigated the risks of sharing their personal lives online. Before we follow in their footsteps, it's worth taking a look at their stories.

In 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting his life online. He shared his thoughts, photos, and art, and people were fascinated by his honesty. But when he fell in love and wrote about it online, his partner asked him to choose between his blog and their relationship. Hall's story is a reminder that sharing our lives online can have consequences.

Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, wrote about her job and her personal life. However, when an anonymous colleague shared her blog with her bosses, she lost her job. This is an example of the ""online distribution effect,"" where we feel we can say things online that we wouldn't say in person. But the web is not a separate reality where we can be anonymous. Our online and offline lives are connected, and we need to be careful about what we share.

Heather Armstrong's story has a happy ending. She learned to manage her online presence and is now a successful blogger and mother. Her experience teaches us that while the web allows us to share our thoughts and feelings, we should think carefully about the consequences of our online actions.<|eot_id|>"

A few years ago, some scientists started warning people about a low-budget film called What the Bleep Do We Know? The film combined documentary and drama to show that there is still much we don't understand about our universe. While it's true that scientists can be a bit arrogant, even the most confident physicist wouldn't claim to know everything. Despite this, some scientists felt compelled to issue public warnings, describing the film as ""atrocious"" or ""dangerous"". This sparked my curiosity, and I had to see the movie for myself.

For the first 20 minutes, I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about. Scientists were simply stating that new discoveries were revealing the universe to be stranger than expected. However, when the film discussed these discoveries, I started to understand the fuss. One example was the ability of water molecules to be affected by thought. I had heard rumors about a Japanese researcher who had shown that the shape of a water molecule could change dramatically just by the thoughts of those around it. The film presented some pictures of ice crystals that looked nice when someone was happy and nasty when someone was in a bad mood. While many people find this kind of evidence compelling, scientists were skeptical. They wanted more concrete proof that the effect was real.

The problem was that the film's claims weren't bizarre enough. For instance, water molecules owe their properties to a form of energy that appears out of nowhere, linked to a force driving the expansion of the universe. This is supported by decades of research in laboratories and observatories worldwide. In reality, discoveries are being made that prove the universe is stranger than anyone could have imagined. Astronomers have found that the universe is made up of unknown matter and propelled by a mysterious force called ""dark energy"". On a more down-to-earth level, neuroscientists have found evidence that our conscious perception of events lags behind reality by half a second, which is edited out by our brains. Anthropologists have identified the birthplace of modern humans and how they left to populate the world. Some theorists have even linked the existence of life on Earth to the fundamental design of the universe.

Despite what some might believe, science is not complete. In fact, we are further away from omniscience than ever. Many natural phenomena can never be fully understood, and the concepts of chaos and quantum uncertainty have set limits on what we can know. Some leading theoretical physicists are working on the Theory of Everything, which will summarize all the forces and particles of the universe in a single equation. In the end, many of us believe the universe is best described in one word: incredible.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 learner:

Writing novels and short stories are two different experiences for me. Writing novels is like planting a forest, while writing short stories is like tending a garden. Both processes are essential to my writing career. I alternate between writing novels and short stories, never doing both at the same time. This helps me switch between different mental gears and avoid burnout.

I started writing short stories later in my career, in the 1980s. It was a challenging but rewarding experience. I found that short stories allowed me to explore new ideas and experiment with different styles. Readers seemed to appreciate this new side of me as a writer.

One of the advantages of writing short stories is that they are quicker to complete. I can finish a short story in about a week, whereas novels take months or even years. This flexibility is essential for me, as it allows me to take a break from the intense focus required for novel-writing.

I also enjoy the freedom to explore small, everyday ideas in short stories. It's like jazz improvisation, where the story takes shape as I write. And if a story doesn't work out, I don't worry about it. I can learn from the experience and try again.

In fact, short stories serve as a kind of experimental laboratory for me as a novelist. I can try out new ideas and techniques without committing to a full-length novel. Without short stories, I would find it harder to write novels, as I would be stuck in one mode for too long.

My short stories are like personal markers, left behind in the world. I remember exactly where I wrote each one and how I felt when I did. They are a way for me to share my inner thoughts and emotions with readers, and it brings me joy as a writer.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 learner:

Science is a vast and complex field that has both fascinated and threatened humanity. It has made our lives easier and more comfortable, but it has also led to conflicts and controversies. Scientists have always struggled to understand the universe and its many mysteries, from the smallest atoms to the vastness of space. They have developed theories and ideas that have changed the way we think about the world and our place in it.

Despite its importance, science is not without its limitations and flaws. Scientists are human, and their work is subject to errors and biases. Theories are often challenged and replaced by new discoveries, and the history of science is marked by controversy and debate. However, this struggle for knowledge has led to significant advances in our understanding of the world and our ability to predict and manipulate it.

Science is not just about discovering new things; it is also about applying what we know to improve our lives. In the past, science has helped us develop new technologies, cure diseases, and improve our understanding of the world. Today, scientists are working on some of the biggest challenges facing humanity, from climate change to the search for a cure for cancer.

As science continues to evolve, it is essential that we, as a society, understand its importance and its limitations. Non-scientists need to be aware of the implications of scientific discoveries and the potential risks and benefits of new technologies. By engaging with science and its applications, we can work together to shape a better future for ourselves and for future generations.

Here is the simplified text:

For several years, ebook sales had been growing rapidly. However, around 2015, major publishers started to report that sales had plateaued or even decreased in some cases. This led to concerns about the long-term viability of ebooks in the publishing industry. Some publishing executives admitted that the hype around ebooks might have led to overinvestment, causing them to lose faith in the power of physical books. Despite the evidence suggesting that digital and print can coexist, the debate about whether ebooks will replace print books continues. This debate is not just about predicting the future, but also about our emotional attachment to books and the fear of change.

The idea of a new technology replacing an old one is not new. In the past, critics have predicted the demise of various media, such as radio and television, but they have ultimately coexisted with new technologies. We develop emotional bonds with different media, and the emergence of a new technology forces us to adjust to change. As a result, we often nostalgically look back at what we used to have, which can lead to the development of industries around retro products.

The spread of the printing press, for example, led people to seek out original manuscripts, while the shift from silent to sound movies created nostalgia for the older form. Similarly, the transition from analog to digital photography and from vinyl records to CDs sparked a new appreciation for the material quality of older products. The rise of e-readers has led to a renewed appreciation for the physical quality of printed books, including their distinctive smell.

While the idea of the disappearing book may be unsettling, it is a narrative that reflects both our excitement about new technologies and our fear of change. We often use familiar narrative patterns, such as the story of tragedy and ending, to make sense of change. The story of the death of the book is a reminder of our attachment to what we have and our fear of losing parts of our lives.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 level learner:

I spent almost a year and a half every weekday morning, waking up at 5:30, brushing my teeth, making coffee, and writing about how some of the most brilliant people of the past 400 years managed to do their best work. I focused on the daily routines of famous thinkers, writers, and artists, including when they slept, ate, worked, and worried. By exploring these everyday habits, I aimed to provide a new perspective on their personalities and careers. 

The idea is that our daily routines reveal our true nature. As the French gastronome Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin once said, ""Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are."" I say, ""Tell me how you spend your time, and I'll tell you what you're like."" This book is about the daily habits of creative people, not just their final products. It's about how they managed their time and energy to produce great work.

My own struggles with balancing creative work and making a living are reflected in this book. I wanted to know how others dealt with similar challenges. How do you find the time to do meaningful creative work while earning a living? Should you dedicate yourself fully to a project or set aside time each day for it? When there's not enough time for everything, do you have to give something up, or can you learn to be more efficient?

I don't claim to have the answers in this book, but I've gathered examples of how successful people have tackled these issues. I wanted to show how grand ideas can be broken down into small, daily tasks, and how our daily routines can influence our work and vice versa.

The title of the book is Daily Rituals, but my focus is really on people's routines. The word ""routine"" often implies a lack of thought or creativity, but in the right hands, it can be a powerful tool for making the most of limited resources, such as time, willpower, and optimism.

I stumbled upon this idea by accident. One Sunday afternoon, I was supposed to write an article, but instead, I spent the day tidying my office and making coffee. I'm a morning person, but after lunch, I lose focus. That day, I started researching how other writers worked, and it led to the idea of creating a blog and eventually this book. The book is a collection of daily routines from various sources, including biographies, interviews, and letters. I've tried to let the individuals speak for themselves, using their own words whenever possible.<|eot_id|>"

Howard became interested in paleontology when he was six years old. His family had planned a holiday to Spain, but due to rising interest rates, they had to cancel it and went to the English coast instead. On the beach, Howard found an ammonite, which sparked his passion for paleontology. He decided to focus on the earliest periods of Earth's history, rather than the more spectacular dinosaurs. After completing his university studies, Howard struggled to find a job in the field. He applied for an Assistant Lectureship at Tavistock College in London, but was not optimistic about his chances. The interview went smoothly, but the professor who was supposed to chair the panel was involved in a car accident and couldn't attend. A less supportive professor took his place, and Howard was surprised to find that he got the job. Months later, Howard learned that the professor who replaced the injured one had a personal vendetta against his previous employer and had intentionally chosen Howard for the position.

Howard was initially disappointed, but grateful to have the job. He soon found that his professional life was predictable and organized, whereas his personal life was often chaotic. One day, his briefcase containing his lecture notes was stolen at an Underground station, forcing him to postpone the lecture. Later, he met a curator from the Natural History Museum in Nairobi and learned about a recently acquired collection of fossils that needed to be studied and cataloged. This discovery changed his plans and gave him a new goal. Without the theft, he might not have discovered this opportunity, which would have a significant impact on his career.

Charles Spence, a professor of experimental psychology at Oxford University, is known for his unusual eating habits. He and his team are researching how our senses interact to form our perception of food and drink. They study how things like the color, texture, and weight of plates and cutlery, as well as the background noise, affect our taste. Spence's work has influenced the food industry, from large companies to restaurants. His research shows that the person who orders first in a restaurant enjoys their food the most, and that eating with others can increase food consumption.

Spence's lab is not high-tech, but he can work with cooks who can't fund their own research. He is currently helping famous brands reduce salt and sugar in their products. Many companies have been making these changes secretly, as people tend to notice when they are told about the changes. Spence has also worked with famous chefs, including Heston Blumenthal, to create unique dishes. His research has shown that the sound of music can affect the way we perceive flavors, with higher-pitched music making food taste sweeter and lower-pitched music making it taste bitter.

Spence's work has many practical applications, such as matching music with food in restaurants and on airplanes. He also applies his research to his own life, experimenting with different sounds and flavors at home. His family has even had dinner parties with unusual themes, such as eating with rabbit fur-wrapped cutlery.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 learner:

Our brains are busier than ever. We're constantly bombarded with information, and it's hard to distinguish between what's important and what's not. At the same time, we're doing more things on our own, like booking flights and making purchases online. We're doing the work of multiple people, but we're also trying to balance our personal and professional lives. Our smartphones have become an essential tool, but they can also be a distraction.

Many of us think we're good at multitasking, but research suggests that's not the case. Our brains aren't designed to handle multiple tasks at once. Instead, we're constantly switching between tasks, which can be inefficient and stressful. This can lead to decreased productivity and even affect our mental health.

Multitasking has been linked to increased levels of stress hormones, which can impair our ability to focus. Additionally, our brains have a natural tendency to be distracted by new and exciting things, making it difficult to stay focused. The irony is that the very part of our brain responsible for staying on task is easily distracted.

Research has shown that multitasking can have a significant impact on our cognitive performance. In fact, trying to focus on a task while being interrupted by emails or other distractions can reduce our IQ by almost 10 points. This is because our brains are wired to respond to new information, even if it's not important.

The constant stream of information can also lead to decision fatigue, where we make poor decisions due to the sheer number of choices we're forced to make. This can be particularly problematic in a work setting, where making good decisions is crucial.

In conclusion, while technology has made it easier to access information, it's also created new challenges. We need to be aware of the potential pitfalls of multitasking and take steps to manage our time and attention effectively. By doing so, we can reduce stress, increase productivity, and make better decisions.<|eot_id|>"

In a Swedish zoo, a chimpanzee named Santino would break up concrete blocks at night and throw them at visitors during the day. Was he being mean-spirited? In caves in the US, female bats help other female bats that are having trouble giving birth. Are they being kind? Fifty years ago, scientists mainly focused on the behaviors of animals and the results they produced. They didn't think about whether animals had feelings or moral values. However, recent research on animals like bats, chimps, rats, dolphins, and chickens has changed this perspective. Scientists are now exploring the emotions of animals, and this has led to a debate about whether animals have consciousness, or the ability to think and feel. This debate has also raised questions about whether animals have a moral sense, or conscience.

A recent experiment with cows showed that those that learned to open a gate to get food seemed to enjoy it more than those that didn't. If cows enjoy problem-solving, what does this mean for the way we treat them and eat them? Some experts, like Dr. Jonathan Balcombe, think that this research means we should stop eating meat. Others, like Professor Aubrey Manning, believe we should rethink our understanding of animal intelligence. Professor Euan MacPhail suggests that we should stop attributing human-like thoughts and feelings to animals.

The debate is not just about science, but also about philosophy. It's difficult to define consciousness, and it's hard to know what it's like to be an animal. Dr. Balcombe has conducted research that suggests starlings can get depressed when they are kept in small, unpleasant cages. He believes that animals have feelings and moral values, and that we should treat them with respect. Professor Manning agrees that animals have a different kind of intelligence, but thinks we should be careful not to overstate their abilities. The debate will likely continue, with no clear answer in sight.<|eot_id|>"

Critical thinking is the ability to understand and analyze information deeply. Adrian West, a researcher at the Edward de Bono Foundation, believes that argument is a way to find the truth. However, he also thinks that the increasing amount of information available through technology is making it harder for people to think critically. We are exposed to more information, but this does not necessarily mean we are thinking more deeply.

According to West, the wealth of information can overwhelm our ability to reason. Moreover, the amount of data and information available does not necessarily lead to better decision-making or greater knowledge. In fact, the quality of our thinking has not improved significantly.

The National Endowment for the Arts has reported a decline in literary reading, which may be contributing to a decline in critical thinking. Patricia Greenfield, a professor of psychology, believes that a focus on visual media, such as video games and television, is reducing the time people spend reading and thinking critically.

However, Greenfield also notes that technology can have both positive and negative effects on critical thinking. For example, a computer game can promote critical thinking or hinder it. Reading on the internet can improve analytical skills, but chasing hyperlinks can make it harder to think deeply.

Exposure to technology changes the way people think, says Greenfield. Visual media, such as video games and television, can improve some types of information processing, but they do not allow for reflection, analysis, or imagination. As a result, many people, especially younger ones, may not be making the most of their capabilities.

The way we view technology affects how we perceive critical thinking. James Paul Gee, a professor of educational psychology, argues that video games are not only a form of entertainment but also a tool for learning. In fact, games like Sim City and Civilization can teach decision-making and analytical skills in immersive, virtual environments.

It is clear that in the digital age, we need to understand the subtleties of how technology affects thinking and analysis. As reading and math scores decline, it is time to take a closer look at technology and its impact on our minds.<|eot_id|>"

Matthew Crawford is a motorcycle mechanic and writer who has written several books about the importance of manual trades and how to cope with modern life. He noticed that advertisements are becoming increasingly difficult to avoid, even when we're just doing simple tasks like shopping. This constant distraction is making it hard for us to think and focus on what's important. We're also becoming less likely to engage with people in person, preferring to interact with representations of people through screens.

Crawford argues that this is a problem because it's affecting our ability to form genuine connections with others. He suggests that we're becoming too focused on our individual desires and needs, and not enough on the world around us. He believes that this is partly due to the way technology is designed to keep us engaged and distracted.

Crawford thinks that one way to solve this problem is to regulate noise and distractions in public spaces, and to develop skills that allow us to engage with the world in a more meaningful way. He gives examples of people who have to deal with physical reality in their work, such as cooks, ice-hockey players, and motorbike racers. These people have to use their judgment and manage the presence of others in order to succeed.

Crawford believes that engaging with the world in this way can be beneficial not only in terms of professional satisfaction, but also in terms of personal well-being. When we focus on one thing and resist distractions, we become better at paying attention to what's important. This, in turn, makes it easier to form connections with others.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

What do people usually ask when they meet someone? 'What do you do for a living?' It's a common question, and most people answer with a few words. However, when you're a philosopher, it's a bit more complicated. Saying you're a philosopher can sound pretentious, as if you're claiming to have some special knowledge or insight that others don't. But this isn't true. Philosophers are just people who think deeply about the world and human nature.

So, why do people often have a certain idea of what a philosopher is? One reason is that philosophers have a reputation for judging others and celebrating intellectual pursuits. In ancient Greece, the philosopher Aristotle believed that a life of contemplation was the most virtuous one. While few modern philosophers agree with this, there's still a cultural idea that philosophy is connected to intellectual pursuits.

Another Greek philosopher, Socrates, said that an unexamined life is not worth living. This means that we should take time to think about our values and beliefs, and not just accept what others tell us. This doesn't mean we have to be experts in philosophy or read a lot of books. It simply means taking a closer look at our daily experiences and making sure they're what we want.

There's another reason why people might think philosophers are remote from reality. Many philosophers work in universities and focus on very specific topics. This can make it hard for others to understand what they're talking about. To change this, philosophers need to find ways to share their ideas with a wider audience.

I often describe myself as an ethicist, as most of my work is in ethics, which is the part of philosophy that deals with evaluating human behavior. However, I've come to realize that this title doesn't fully capture my work, as ethics is often associated with formal codes and laws. In reality, ethics is about exploring how we think about responsibility, our attitudes towards art, and the influence of consumerism, among other things. By examining these ideas, philosophy can help people understand their daily lives better and make more informed decisions.

Here is the simplified text:

Food and philosophy have not always gone hand in hand. Historically, philosophers have used food as a metaphor for other topics, rather than exploring its own significance. However, food is more than just a means to an end. It is a fundamental part of our daily lives, and its cultural and social aspects are undeniable.

The ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus advocated for the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain, but his ideas have been misinterpreted as being solely about eating and drinking. In reality, his philosophy was about living a happy and fulfilling life, and food was just one aspect of that.

Food is inherently social and cultural, and our eating habits are shaped by our communities and historical contexts. The way we eat is closely tied to our relationships with others and the way we live.

Food critics and writers often talk about the taste and quality of food, but this is not a special expertise. Rather, it is a skill that anyone can develop. The way we perceive and describe food is an area that has been neglected in philosophical discussions.

Food can also be considered an aesthetic experience, but this is complicated by the fact that it is consumed and destroyed in the process of enjoyment. Some philosophers argue that food has earned its place in aesthetic discourse, but this is a topic of ongoing debate.

Food raises many ethical questions, such as what we should eat and why. These questions reveal our values and beliefs, and philosophers will continue to explore these issues.

Cooking in restaurants and at home are two different experiences. Home cooks have a special responsibility to their guests, while professional chefs have obligations to their employers and the food itself. This difference reflects the different relationships we have with food in different contexts.

Food can also play a role in bridging cultural gaps. By learning to appreciate and enjoy different cuisines, we can build bridges between cultures and form personal connections with people from other backgrounds. This is a powerful tool for international diplomacy.

Overall, food is a complex and multifaceted topic that deserves more philosophical attention. By exploring its cultural, social, aesthetic, and ethical dimensions, we can gain a deeper understanding of its significance in our lives.<|eot_id|>"

Rob Daviau, an American game designer, created a new type of board game called 'legacy' games. He wanted to make games more exciting and challenging than the ones he played as a child. He started by modifying a classic game called Risk, creating a new version called Risk Legacy. In this version, players' decisions had a lasting impact on the game. For example, they might have to tear up cards or damage the board.

Daviau was then asked to create a legacy version of another popular game called Pandemic. This game is about working together to save the world from diseases. His next project was a game called SeaFall, set in the age of sail. In this game, players become sailors exploring a new world.

To design legacy games, designers need to think about all the possible choices players can make and how they will affect the game. They test the games with players to see how they unfold. One tester, Jaime Barriga, said it takes a lot of time and effort to play-test a legacy game. He said that sometimes the game starts to get confusing or broken after a few games.

Daviau never expected legacy games to become popular, but many players loved the concept. They enjoy the sense of adventure and the feeling of making progress in the game. One player, Russell Chapman, said that legacy games are the biggest advance in game design in years.

The idea of legacy games is influenced by video games and TV shows. Players are used to experiencing a story over several episodes, and legacy games offer a similar experience. Matt Leacock, the creator of Pandemic, compared the legacy design process to writing a novel. He said that designers need to have a clear idea of where the story starts and ends, but also need to be flexible and open to changes.

Daviau is proud of his creation, but he also wants to see where others take the idea. He thinks that soon, players will be looking for new and innovative game designs. Colby Dauch, the studio manager for the publisher of SeaFall, is excited about the potential of legacy games. He believes that they can change the way people think about board games.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

In recent years, an octopus named Inky made headlines when he escaped from his tank at a New Zealand aquarium. He climbed out of his tank, crawled across the floor, and squeezed through a drain to reach the Pacific Ocean. This remarkable story was widely shared online and sparked a discussion about the intelligence of octopuses. Octopuses are known for their exceptional abilities, such as opening jars, recognizing faces, and even playing with objects. Some people like to imagine that animals, including octopuses, are like humans, which is known as anthropomorphism. However, Dr. Frans de Waal, a primate expert, argues that this is not anthropomorphism, but rather a refusal to recognize the human-like traits of animals, which he calls anthropodenial.

De Waal believes that animals are smarter than we often give them credit for. They have been observed exhibiting complex behaviors, such as considering the past and future, showing empathy and self-awareness, and anticipating the actions of others. In fact, animals have been demonstrating these abilities for decades, and it is only recently that we have begun to recognize their intelligence.

Historically, people have had different views on animal intelligence. In the past, animals were considered sophisticated enough to be put on trial for crimes. Even Charles Darwin, the father of evolution, believed that the difference in intelligence between humans and animals was one of degree, not kind. However, the rise of behaviorism in the 20th century led to a shift in public perception of animal intelligence. Animals were seen as either stimulus-response machines or robots with useful instincts.

Fortunately, this view is changing. De Waal believes that we are emerging from this period of anthropodenial and learning to appreciate animal cognition as a spectrum, although not necessarily at the same level as humans. The most effective way to test animal intelligence is to design tests that take into account the species' unique traits and skills. For example, squirrels may not excel at human memory tasks, but they can remember where they hid their food caches.

De Waal is skeptical of Inky's escape story, but he acknowledges the power of viral stories to raise awareness about animal intelligence. He has conducted experiments, such as testing capuchin monkeys' ability to experience envy, which have been widely shared and have helped to change our understanding of animal cognition.<|eot_id|>"

'The field of robotics is expected to bring about a significant technological shift, potentially even more impactful than industrialization. While robots have been used in the automotive and manufacturing sectors for decades, experts predict a rapid increase in their use across various industries. Many people recognize the potential disruption caused by robotic automation, but still believe that their jobs will remain unchanged. However, this is unlikely. Every sector will be affected by automation in the coming years. For example, a robot developed by an Australian company can lay 1,000 bricks in an hour, a task that would take human bricklayers much longer to complete.

Robots are not just limited to industrial settings; they are being used in supermarkets to ensure shelves are stocked and priced correctly. While some argue that robots will create new, high-skilled jobs, others warn that the loss of human touch will have a significant impact on society.

Dr Jing Bing Zhang, a world expert on robotics, emphasizes the importance of adapting to this change. According to his research, within the next two years, one-third of robots will be able to work alongside humans and within five years, salaries in the robotics sector will increase by at least 60%. However, many jobs in this field will remain vacant due to a shortage of skilled workers.

Zhang believes that people need to be retrained to adapt to the changing job market. He emphasizes that no one can expect to do the same job for life, and that education is key to preparing for the robotic workforce of the future.

In the coming years, we can expect to see robots that interact with us in more sophisticated ways, such as robots that can live in our homes. This presents both opportunities and challenges, including the need for new regulatory frameworks to ensure our safety and privacy. As the employment market becomes increasingly unstable, it is essential that we invest in education to prepare for the robotic workforce of tomorrow.'<|eot_id|>"

When asked why he wanted to climb it, the mountaineer George Mallory replied, ""Because it's there."" This answer may seem simple, but it's actually a reminder that sometimes people do things just because they want to, without needing a deeper reason.

Climbing is often seen as a mysterious activity, and many people wonder why anyone would risk their lives to reach the top of a mountain. However, for many climbers, the thrill of adventure and the sense of freedom they feel when climbing are enough to make it worthwhile.

In his book ""Games that Climbers Play,"" the Bolivian writer Tejada-Flores identified seven different types of climbing activities, each with its own set of rules. He argued that the way climbers approach a climb depends on the type of game they are playing.

For some climbers, the sense of freedom they feel when climbing is a major draw. However, climbing can also be a confining and restricting activity, especially when faced with bad weather or other challenges. This can create a paradox, as climbers may feel both free and trapped at the same time.

In his essay, the US rock climber Joe Fitschen suggests that the real question is not ""Why do I climb?"" but ""Why do people climb?"" He argues that climbing is an innate human impulse, driven by our desire to take risks and test our limits.

Another perspective on climbing comes from the US academic Brian Treanor, who believes that climbing can help develop important virtues such as courage, humility, and respect for the environment. He argues that these virtues are essential in today's world, where people often prioritize safety and convenience over personal growth.

Finally, some climbers believe that the most committed and dedicated climbers are the ones who achieve the greatest recognition. This is because they have to rely solely on their own abilities and resources to succeed, rather than relying on others or technology.

Overall, climbing is a complex and multifaceted activity that can be seen from many different perspectives. Whether it's the thrill of adventure, the sense of freedom, the development of virtues, or the commitment to one's goals, there are many reasons why people are drawn to climbing.<|eot_id|>"

For over 60 years, the renowned pianist Alfred Brendel was a dominant figure in the classical music world. He was a thoughtful and serious person who focused on performing and recording the most important European piano pieces. Although he wrote and performed a lot, he rarely taught others. Those who knew him well saw a playful side to his personality, but it was not often visible in his concerts. Brendel's life was a continuous cycle of studying, traveling, and performing.

One day, a 14-year-old boy named Kit Armstrong approached Brendel after a concert and asked for lessons. Initially, Brendel was not interested, but he was impressed by Kit's exceptional talent and ability to play complex pieces by heart. Brendel was particularly struck by Kit's musical overview and subtlety. As Brendel is now retiring from public performances, Kit is gradually gaining recognition – with Brendel's careful guidance, as he is cautious about Kit burning out too quickly.

Kit, now 19, is a restless and ambitious young man who is always learning new skills, such as languages, mathematics, and computer programming. He also composes music and is a quick learner. Brendel praises Kit's phenomenal memory, sight-reading ability, and sensitivity to sound. However, he also warns against setting too high expectations, as Kit is still developing and can play certain pieces well, but not others.

At 80, Brendel is now enjoying his post-performance years, reflecting on his life and career. He explains that he never had a strong desire for fame, but rather focused on achieving certain goals by the age of 50. Although he is no longer physically capable of performing, his mind is still active, and he is exploring new musical projects.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

When I was a child, I thought all gardens were beautiful and peaceful places. My grandfather's garden was no exception. It was situated on the bank of a river and sloped gently down towards the water. Although you couldn't reach the river, you could hear the sound of the water and the birds singing in the trees. I imagined that all gardens were like this - a place to escape, relax, and be alone. My grandfather's garden wasn't particularly special, with no greenhouse like some of his neighbors had. Instead, they used old window frames to create makeshift greenhouses. At home, my father was a quiet and reserved person. He wasn't always serious, though, and enjoyed making jokes. He often used the phrase ""It's immaterial to me,"" which I thought was funny. Deep down, I think he was a bit disappointed with his life. He left school without qualifications and became an apprentice plumber, which wasn't his passion. He wasn't ambitious, but he did have a moment when he and my mother considered moving to Canada. However, it didn't happen.

What my father was good at was fixing things around the house. He had an eye for detail and could do amazing things with bookshelves or cupboards. My parents only moved once during their entire marriage, but my mother loved to redecorate and would often surprise us with new furniture. The most dramatic change was when we got a piano, which intimidated me at first. I didn't like it, but I did like the two brass candlesticks on the front. They disappeared later, and I never got to play the piano. My sister received lessons instead.

I always preferred spending time by the river. I would walk along the bank, looking for a good spot to take off my sandals and go fishing with a net. I'd try to catch fish and then release them back into the water. I wanted to leave school as soon as possible, but it seemed unlikely until my father told me about a job opening for an apprentice gardener in the Parks Department. I was thrilled, and I think my father was secretly pleased too. He might have preferred it if I became a carpenter, but he noticed my passion for gardening and wanted me to pursue it.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Lawrence MacEwen and I are standing on his Scottish island, the Isle of Muck. The strong Atlantic wind is blowing, and we're both crouched down, trying to stay steady. His sheepdog, Tie, comes up to him, and he strokes him gently. The howling wind can't make him uncomfortable here, on his island, where he feels completely at home.

MacEwen is showing me around his neighborhood. He points to the north and says, 'That's the island of Eigg. The one to the west is the Isle of Rum, which gets twice as much rain as we do.' I watch as heavy clouds dump rain on its mountains.

As we walk down the hill, he tells me more about the island. Muck is three kilometers long and half as wide. The geese eat a lot of grass, and the MacEwens have been living here for 3,000 years.

We have to interrupt our walk to move the sheep. Tie, the sheepdog, is having trouble herding them, and MacEwen is not happy. 'Away to me, Tie. Away to me,' he says, meaning the dog should circle around to the right. But Tie goes straight up the middle of the flock, causing confusion.

The Isle of Muck is largely a MacEwen family business. Lawrence runs the farm with his wife, Jenny; their son, Colin, manages the island cottages; and their daughter, Mary, runs the island hotel with her husband, Toby. Mary and Toby love that their two boys can explore the island on their own and sail dinghies in the summer.

However, island life has its challenges. We don't always have electricity, and my first evening, I wait anxiously for the lights to turn on. The next morning, I find Mary making breakfast by torchlight. I get used to it, along with not having a mobile phone signal. 'There's mobile reception on the hill,' Mary tells me. 'Most people last a couple of days, then just put their phone away.'

Everything on Muck seems unusual. The boat brings over some groceries and three musicians, who play their instruments in the tearoom. The islanders love the music and tap their boots along. That night, Lawrence tells me how he met his wife, Jenny. Her father bought a farm on the Isle of Soay without even visiting it, and Jenny was sent to manage it. She didn't know much about farming, but she was good at typing.

I go to bed with the sound of rain and wake up to more rain. But I eat well, as almost all the food comes from the island. Mary sends me to fisherman Sandy Mathers for fresh fish, and I bring it back to her at the kitchen door. By 7 pm, our fish is on the table, and it's delicious. The next morning, I take the ferry to my next island, which is a relief, as many of the ferries had been cancelled due to high seas. If my ferry didn't come, I would have been stuck on Muck for two more days, which, without a phone, was what I secretly longed for.<|eot_id|>"

The video game industry has traditionally been seen as a niche field, with limited opportunities for entry. However, the industry is now taking itself more seriously and is in need of talented game designers. According to Jim Donelly, a representative of an online games magazine, the industry needs people with a range of skills, from high-level directors to lower-level designers of individual game elements. While many companies prefer candidates with a degree in computer science, Jim believes that making games is the best way to get into the industry. He emphasizes that game design is not just a job, but a way of life that requires dedication and creativity.

John Field, another industry expert, agrees that making games is essential, but notes that it's not as simple as just ""doing it"". He believes that there are many people who want to work in the industry, but few who have the necessary skills, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit to succeed. John suggests that a postgraduate course in game design can be helpful, as it provides support and guidance. Many game designers start their careers as programmers or artists and work their way up the ladder.

John also highlights the importance of connections and networking in getting ahead in the industry. He notes that the stereotype of the adolescent boy glued to his console has been replaced by a more accurate perception of the medium as a grown-up, sophisticated form of entertainment. With the rise of smartphones and social media, there is a growing demand for games and a wealth of new opportunities for designers. John sees the industry as an expanding field with plenty of room for growth and innovation.

From a young age, I've always been passionate about playing football. My dad encouraged me to play, but not in a pushy way. I had a friend who had a father who was very demanding, always telling him what he couldn't do. As a result, my friend lost interest in playing football and never pursued it further. I'm glad I didn't have that experience. When I score a remarkable goal from a distance, people often say it's just luck, but it's not. I've been practicing my long-range shots since I was a kid. You need to work hard to achieve spectacular goals that give you such a thrill. Even top players wouldn't be where they are today without years of dedication. I try to teach kids to enjoy learning new skills. At school, I was involved in various sports, from rounders to athletics. I know now that education is important, but football was my main focus back then. My teachers did a good job, but I didn't appreciate it at the time. I don't want my son to have the same experience. We're already reading to him, even though he's too young to sit still for long. I hope he doesn't develop the same passion for football as I do. In my early professional career, our manager made sacrifices so that younger players like me could join the first team. He never made a big fuss about it, but we knew we had to prove ourselves. Although I scored in our first game of the season, we lost, and a TV presenter famously said, 'You can't win anything with kids.' That made us realize how much we had to work. We had doubts, but we believed in ourselves as a team. I rely on my close friends and family. However, having a lot of money can sometimes cause problems. For example, people sometimes say I'm too generous with my parents. I've helped them financially, paying off their mortgage and buying them a car. My family is strong and independent, and I think they would be offended if they felt they were on my payroll. My mum works as a hairdresser, and she loves her job. On the other hand, it gives me pleasure to use my money to make things easier for the people around me. I have a lot of money, but it doesn't solve all my problems. After I retire from football, I plan to take a year off or more to do things I haven't been able to do while playing. I want to go skiing the day after I stop playing, but I can't do that now because if I were to get injured and couldn't play football again, I wouldn't be insured.'<|eot_id|>"

We lived at Reef Point because of Sam Carter, my father's agent in Los Angeles. He found us a place to stay because my father was struggling to write while we were in Los Angeles, and Sam was worried about losing clients and money. The beach at Reef Point was usually quiet because of the fog that rolled in during the summer. But now, with the hot weather, the beach was bustling with people. My father was working hard to finish a script by the deadline, while I spent my days reading and playing with my dog, Rusty. Rusty was a stray who had wandered into our lives and decided to stay. He loved the beach and would often dig up things and bring them to me. Sometimes, he would find things that didn't belong to him, like a new sneaker or a beach towel, and I would have to return them to their owners.

One day, my father left to deliver the script to Los Angeles, and Rusty and I spent the afternoon swimming and playing together. As the sun began to set, we sat on the beach and watched the surfers. One surfer in particular caught my eye - she was an expert and had a unique style. She noticed me watching her and asked why I hadn't joined them. I told her I didn't have a surfboard, and she suggested I could get one. She asked if I was British and visiting, and I told her I lived there. She asked if my father was American, and I said he was there to write a film script based on a novel he had written. She seemed interested and asked if my father was Rufus Marsh, the author of ""Tall as the Morning"". When I nodded, she looked at me with new interest and asked me more questions.<|eot_id|>"

Violet Hetherington stood in a long queue at the Southampton dock, waiting to board the Queen Caroline. She was getting anxious, as the queue wasn't moving. Her friend Annie had advised her to arrive late, but that didn't seem to be working out. Suddenly, an announcement came over the loudspeaker: the computer system had broken down. The atmosphere among the passengers turned gloomy, with some people getting frustrated and others trying to stay calm. Violet was feeling annoyed and worried. She had paid a lot of money for this cruise and didn't want it to be a disaster.

As she waited, Violet realized she had lost her phone. This was a major problem, as it had all her important numbers stored in it. She couldn't even call the taxi company to check if she had left it behind. She was starting to regret her decision to take the cruise.

A friendly couple behind her in the queue offered to let her use their phone to call her son Harry. Violet asked him to check with their neighbor Kristina to see if the phone had been left at their flat. She was relieved to have found a solution, but didn't want to admit it to Harry.

As the queues started moving, Violet made her way to the ship's foyer. She was disappointed by the tacky decor, with its fake walnut panels, chandeliers, and patterned carpets. She took the elevator to the twelfth floor, where she finally reached her room. She was relieved to find that it had a balcony, which she had been worried about. She had paid a high price to ensure she got a balcony, and was glad it had all worked out.

John Maloof bought a box of old photo negatives at an estate auction without knowing he was about to uncover the mystery of Vivian Maier, a talented street photographer. Maloof was looking for images to use in a book about the Portage Park neighborhood in Chicago, but instead, he found 30,000 photographs by Maier. Since then, Maloof has been studying Maier's life and work. He has an extensive archive of her photographs, including cameras, film, prints, and negatives, as well as 8mm movies and audiotapes. Maloof and his friend Anthony Rydzon have been researching Maier's life, trying to fill in the gaps. They have spoken to families who employed her as a nanny and to people who knew her.

Vivian Maier was born in 1926 in New York and spent part of her childhood in France. She returned to New York and later moved to Chicago, where she worked as a nanny. Maier was known for carrying a camera with her everywhere she went. She was a private person, but she had strong opinions about movies and politics. She was knowledgeable about theater and movies and wasn't afraid to talk to people on the street, sometimes recording their conversations on audiotape.

Maier's photographs are a true work of art, taken for no commercial purpose. They feature women, children, the elderly, the poor, and abstract scenes. Photography expert Larry Silverman notes that her work is influenced by many other photographers, and he wonders if she developed her own style independently. Maloof is still working through the thousands of negatives he has, and he is inspired by Maier's architectural shots, which have led him to take his own photographs. He has realized that Maier's work is more than just cityscapes - it's about people, street scenes, and composition. Now, Maloof and Rydzon are working to get Maier's name recognized and her work into the history books.

Here is the simplified text:

Eleanor Catton's novel, The Luminaries, is a remarkable book that has received great success. When I met her in the UK, she was still in her twenties and had just flown in from Germany. Despite being in the spotlight, she seemed calm and down-to-earth. She told me a funny story about being stopped at passport control and being asked to prove she was a writer. She showed them her novel and was asked what it was about.

The book is set in New Zealand during the 1860s and follows a group of 12 men who are trying to solve a series of crimes. The plot is complex, with many twists and turns. Catton said she originally set out to write a murder mystery, but the historical setting offered many opportunities for complications and misunderstandings.

The book is over 800 pages long, which is necessary to give each of the 20 main characters a decent amount of space. When I asked her how it felt to be so successful at such a young age, she deflected the question by saying it was nice to have the support of her home country, New Zealand. She also mentioned that some people assume that her book is not a philosophical work, which she finds annoying.

Catton explained that she wanted to write the book in a unique way, with each part getting shorter than the one before it. She wanted to create a book with structural patterns that readers could discover if they wanted to, but that didn't detract from the overall story. Despite its experimental structure, the book remains an exciting murder mystery with a gripping plot.

I asked her if she had planned out the book beforehand, and she said she didn't. Instead, she wrote herself into difficult situations and then tried to find creative ways to get out of them. She also wanted to make the book fun to read, with cliffhangers and multiple viewpoints.

We talked about her love of television drama series, and I asked if she might be interested in screenwriting. She seemed enthusiastic about the idea. When we talked about her craft and her love of New Zealand, she lit up. She mentioned that being in a different place can change her imagination and that she notices how the landscape of her imagination changes when she's in a new environment.

For now, New Zealand will remain her home, and I hope it continues to inspire her for many more novels.<|eot_id|>"

Jonny Kinkead has been building steel-string, acoustic guitars by hand for over 40 years. As a child, he would spend his free time playing the guitar and experimenting with different sounds. When he was 11, he learned to play his brother's guitar, and at 16, he built his first bass guitar from scratch. Jonny's passion for guitar-making was sparked by his curiosity about how different types of wood and shapes affect the sound. He studied guitars and figured out how to combine different materials to create unique sounds.

After dropping out of architecture school, Jonny realized that his true passion lay in guitar-making. He continued to develop his skills and eventually started making guitars for a living. Initially, he sold his guitars for the cost of the materials, but as his reputation grew, he was able to charge more. Despite his success, Jonny still produces only about 10 guitars a year, which limits his earnings.

To promote his work, Jonny attended music festivals and encouraged musicians to try out his guitars. He also learned how to price his instruments, which was a challenge for him. Today, Jonny believes that new guitar-makers in the UK have an easier time establishing themselves, as the quality of UK-made guitars is now recognized worldwide.

Jonny emphasizes the importance of both formal education and hands-on experience. He suggests that new instrument-makers should take advantage of the courses available, but also be willing to experiment and learn from their mistakes. According to Jonny, there is no substitute for trial and error, and he believes that self-taught individuals like himself learn more by doing.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 level learner:

When discussing English conversation, it's common to start with the weather. This is because, as the 18th-century diarist Dr. Johnson noted, when two English people meet, their first topic of conversation is usually the weather. This observation remains accurate to this day. However, many commentators have failed to explain why the English are so fascinated with the weather. They often assume that English people are interested in the weather itself, but this is not the case. Instead, our conversations about the weather are a way to overcome our natural reserve and start talking to each other.

For instance, phrases like ""Nice day, isn't it?"" or ""Ooh, it's cold today"" are not genuine inquiries about the weather, but rather fixed greetings or conversation starters. They are a way to break the ice and begin a conversation. This phenomenon is similar to ""social grooming"" among monkeys and apes, where they spend time grooming each other to strengthen social bonds.

There are specific contexts in which weather-speak is used. It can be used as a greeting, as a way to transition to other topics, or as a filler when conversation stalls. This can lead outsiders to believe that English people talk about the weather all the time, but in reality, it's just a way to facilitate conversation. An English conversation may start with a weather-related greeting, progress to some small talk, and then default to weather-speak at regular intervals. It's easy to see why people from other countries and even many English commentators have misunderstood the English obsession with the weather.

Changes made:

* Simplified sentence structures and vocabulary
* Removed complex phrases and sentences
* Clarified the main idea and supporting details
* Removed technical terms like ""unpredictability and danger"" and ""edge of excitement""
* Changed complex concepts like ""social grooming"" to a more accessible explanation
* Removed examples that are not essential to the main idea<|eot_id|>"

Alice Leader was standing in front of the remains of Hadrian's Wall in Britain, explaining to her class of 12- and 13-year-olds how impressive it was that the Romans built this 120 km long and 5 meters high wall over 1900 years ago. She had already sparked their interest, as they had chosen this trip over more glamorous destinations. However, they wanted to know why the wall was built. Alice felt her answers were not satisfactory. She realized that she needed to find a way to make history more engaging for her students. After retiring from teaching after 31 years, Alice decided to become an author in 2001. She wanted to write a historical novel that would bring the past to life for her students. 

Alice believes that teaching and writing are similar, as both require creativity and the ability to engage with people. She loves the process of writing and feels that it is less exhausting than teaching. Her former colleagues admire her for staying connected with children through her writing. 

Alice's goal is to fill a gap in children's literature by writing stories that are neither too dark nor too fantastical. She wants her books to be entertaining and educational. Her love for children and her experience as a teacher inspire her to write. She sees writing as an extension of her teaching, and her stories are designed to make children curious and interested in history. 

Alice's journey as an author began when she was encouraged by her head teacher to take a creative writing course. She was hesitant at first, but the course helped her discover her talent for writing. She wrote a story about a Roman couple and their unborn baby, and the tutors were impressed. They suggested she publish her work, and with the support of her husband, a critic and editor, she wrote her first novel.<|eot_id|>"

To raise money for charity, a newspaper and a TV company challenged brothers Jonny and Alistair Brownlee, professional triathletes, to take part in a unique race. The challenge was to see who would reach a certain point first: Jonny would drive a car on roads, while Alistair would ride a mountain bike across country. The race started at Semerwater lake in Wensleydale and ended at Fleet Moss, the highest road in Yorkshire. The brothers were excited but also a bit nervous. Jonny, who was driving, was looking forward to the beautiful views and the warmth of the car. Alistair, on the other hand, was dressed in full winter cycling gear and was confident he would win.

The race began, and the brothers went their separate ways. Jonny drove on the roads, while Alistair rode his bike up steep hills and across fields. The terrain was challenging, and Jonny faced obstacles like a giant tractor blocking the road. Alistair, meanwhile, had to carry his bike up the hills and navigate through fields. Despite the difficulties, both brothers were determined to win.

As they neared the finish line, Jonny was surprised to find that Alistair was closing in. In the end, Alistair crossed the line first, and Jonny was disappointed but proud of his brother's achievement.<|eot_id|>"

When I play on Centre Court at Wimbledon, the silence is what strikes me. I bounce the ball on the soft grass, toss it up to serve, and hit it. The only sound I hear is the echo of my own shot. The grass, the history, the old stadium, the players in white, and the respectful crowds all create a sense of isolation. The quiet of Centre Court is perfect for my game. What I struggle with most in a tennis match is to focus solely on the game and the point I'm playing. The silence of Centre Court is broken only by the noise of applause and cheers when a point is finished. I hear them, but it's as if they're coming from far away. I'm so focused that I don't even think about the 15,000 people watching me or the millions around the world. I'm completely absorbed in the game.

I've always dreamed of playing at Wimbledon. My uncle, who has been my coach since I was young, told me that this was the biggest tournament. By the time I was 14, I was sharing my fantasy with friends that I'd play here one day and win. Before 2008, I had played and lost to Roger Federer twice - in the final in 2006 and 2007. Losing in 2007 was devastating. I felt like I had let myself down, and I was consumed by regret. I cried for half an hour in the dressing room. Losing hurts, but it hurts even more when you have a chance and let it slip away.

My uncle, who is usually tough on me, was the only one who tried to console me. He told me that there would be more Wimbledons and more chances to win. I told him that this might be my last chance, and I was keenly aware that the life of a professional athlete is short. I wanted to make the most of it while I could. I was determined to learn from my mistakes and not let my head get in the way again.

The day before the final, I was already thinking about the match and how I would play. I didn't want to talk about it with my family and friends, but they knew better than to bring it up. From now on, I needed to focus and stay in my own mental space.<|eot_id|>"

Jane Goodall, a young and idealistic Englishwoman, arrived in Africa in 1957. She was thrilled to be living in the Africa she had always dreamed of. Goodall spent most of her life in Africa and became a renowned scientist, journalist, and environmentalist. Her groundbreaking research on chimpanzees made her a celebrated figure. In 1963, the British National Geographical Society published articles and documentaries about her work, which further boosted her fame.

Goodall's celebrity status has sometimes overshadowed her actual achievements. Many books and articles have been written about her, but they often focus on her adventurous spirit, her passion for animals, and her determination as a woman in a male-dominated field. However, these portrayals downplay her remarkable contributions to the field of biology.

In reality, Goodall's work has been instrumental in shaping our understanding of chimpanzees. Before her research, people thought chimpanzees were just aggressive animals that ate only plants. Goodall discovered that they eat meat, use tools, and even have complex social structures and emotions similar to those of humans. Her book, ""The Chimpanzees of Gombe,"" is considered the definitive work on the subject.

Goodall's study of chimpanzees in Tanzania's Gombe State has been called one of the greatest scientific achievements of the Western world. Her work has revolutionized the way we study animals and has also changed the way we think about ourselves as humans. Even as a child, Goodall showed signs of her future career as a biologist. When she was just five years old, she crawled into a henhouse to observe how hens lay eggs, demonstrating her curiosity and determination.

Many people ask me how I became a cartoonist. It's a dream job that some people have as children, like wanting to be a racing driver. However, most people give up on these childhood fantasies and choose more realistic careers, such as becoming a lawyer or engineer. It's surprising that some people can make a living by drawing simple doodles, but it's true. People become cartoonists in different ways, but most have always wanted to do it. For me, I studied graphic design in college and then showed my illustrations to different companies. I was lucky to find a newspaper that wanted political cartoons on local issues. After a few months, I was making enough money to support myself. You don't need a university degree, a lot of money, or even drawing skills to become a cartoonist. You just need your brain, your hand, and something to make marks. However, it's not an easy job. You need to be passionate about it and willing to work hard. The more skills you have, the better your chances of making a living with your art. I've done various types of cartoons, comics, and even written and designed. I've also learned from work I didn't particularly enjoy. Being intelligent, well-read, and curious also helps. When it comes to the business side of being a cartoonist, things have changed. Today, most cartoonists are entrepreneurs, which means they have to produce and sell their work. The more comfortable you are with this process, the better you'll do. I've seen cartoonists with average creative skills but excellent business skills do better than those with great artistic talent but poor business skills. Some people worry about others stealing their ideas, but it's rare. To protect your work, you just need to add a 'c' for 'copyright' and your name and date. If someone does steal your work, it can be a lucky break.<|eot_id|>"

Twenty years ago, I was moving house and decided to get rid of some old things. I had an electric guitar that my dad had given me for my 16th birthday, but I decided to throw it away. I took it to the dump and was about to put it in the rubbish when a young man stopped me and asked if I was sure I wanted to get rid of it. I said yes, but later I felt guilty for doing so. Years later, I received an email from a guitar dealer named Keith Rushton. He told me that he had found my old guitar and was willing to sell it back to me. I was overjoyed and felt like crying. It turned out that Keith had found a label on the back of the guitar with my name and address, which he used to track me down.

I had forgotten that my dad used to put labels on all my belongings, including my guitar. My parents had wanted me to learn classical guitar, but I switched to electric guitar instead. I loved the sound of the instrument and found it easier to play than the violin. However, I didn't make much progress and eventually stopped playing. When Keith sent me the guitar, I was surprised to find that it felt smaller and smoother than I remembered. I picked it up and started playing, and my fingers knew where to go. I felt a strong urge to play with a strap and stand up, which is typical for electric guitar playing.

I realized that I had been given a second chance to learn and play the guitar again. I might even start a band with my son, who is learning the saxophone. I could also look for other people who have had a similar experience and start a band called ""The Regainers"".

I made some minor changes to the text to make it more accessible to a C1 learner, including:

There has been a lot of discussion about sleep lately. When I wrote my book Insomniac, I felt like a lone voice warning about the dangers of sleep deprivation and its impact on our minds, bodies, and moods. As any insomniac will tell you, sleep is crucial for our mental, physical, and social well-being. It's great that sleep is finally getting the attention it deserves. However, I'm wondering why dreams haven't been discussed as much. We're losing dreams all the time, especially when we wake up to an early alarm, cutting off the last hour or two of sleep. Our most vivid and memorable dreams occur during the REM stage, just before we wake up. A good sleeper spends about a quarter of their sleep time in REM, so a person who lives 90 years will spend six or seven years in REM.

Researchers have found that when people are deprived of REM sleep, they have an increase in REM the following night. This suggests that dreams are important for something. In the past, researchers believed that interpreting dreams could help us understand how our minds work, but this idea was later disputed. Today, there is little agreement among researchers about the purpose of dreams.

However, some researchers have found that people who are creative, such as actors, writers, and directors, have a better ability to remember and use their dreams. This makes sense, as creative people often use their dreams as inspiration. But I think that everyone, regardless of their profession, needs to think creatively. Dreams can help us bring together different ideas and find new connections.

For example, researchers have found that when people are awakened from REM sleep and asked to respond to a certain word, their responses are more original than when they are awakened from other stages of sleep. This is because REM sleep helps us think outside the box and come up with new and creative ideas. I personally find that I write better when I wake up from a dream, even if it's a troubling one. This is because dreams can provide a spark of creativity and inspiration.

In today's complex world, we all need to think creatively and flexibly to navigate our relationships with others. This is why we need to dream and make the most of our dreams.<|eot_id|>"

Twenty years ago, Susie Ray left London to live in a small coastal town in southwest England. As you enter her studio, you'll notice empty frames on the walls, surrounded by happy photos of her two daughters. Despite being a renowned copyist artist, it might seem surprising that she doesn't have any of her own artwork on display. 'I finish them and they go,' she shrugs. The reason is that Susie is in high demand. For over 30 years, she has been reproducing the works of famous artists like Renoir, Monet, and Van Gogh. Her copies are so accurate that art experts often mistake them for the originals. While the originals could fetch millions of pounds at auction, her reproductions sell for a few hundred pounds to £12,000, depending on how much time she spends on them.

Susie's clients include galleries and private collectors, some of whom are genuine art lovers, while others are motivated by status. Some even pass off her copies as originals, but Susie doesn't mind. She believes that as long as she's not the one doing it, it's up to them.

Susie has always been open about what she does. When she reproduces a masterpiece, she aims to make it as authentic as possible, believing that doing it badly would be a disservice to the original artist. However, she always signs her name on the back of the canvas. She knows that passing off a copy as the real thing is illegal, and she has never been tempted to do so.

Before becoming a copyist, Susie worked as an illustrator for a botanical garden. Although it was a low-paying job, it gave her a passion for plants and taught her the importance of accuracy. She advises young artists to learn to draw accurately and to study extensively before attempting to reproduce masterpieces.

Susie specializes in reproducing French impressionist art, particularly the works of Manet, Cezanne, and Degas. She emphasizes that people often underestimate the level of skill required to accurately reproduce impressionist paintings, which were often created quickly and freely, but also required great attention to detail. Despite her skills, Susie doesn't create her own original artwork, preferring to focus on reproducing the works of others. She believes that her years of training and application have allowed her to make a good living from her work, and she has no regrets about her career choice.

Ellen MacArthur's passion for the sea started when she was a child. She loved sailing and racing, and nothing mattered more to her than being the fastest on the water. As she grew older, her obsession with the sea only grew stronger. She spent years sailing around the world, and her boat became her home. After finishing second in the Vendée Globe, a solo round-the-world race, Ellen took me on a tour of her boat, showing me the careful planning and organization that went into preparing for her journey. She emphasized the importance of preparation and taking care of her boat, as her life depended on it.

Ellen's perspective on the world changed during a trip to South Georgia, where she helped with a bird survey. Seeing the abandoned whaling stations and the damage to the environment made her realize the importance of taking care of the planet. She began to see the world as a fragile, beautiful thing that needed to be protected.

Ellen now believes that it's essential to take action to save the planet. She argues that we should focus on reusing and recycling, rather than just using less. She has been touring factories, mines, and power stations, talking to government and business leaders about the importance of sustainability. Ellen has also launched the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a charity that works to give young people the vision to create a sustainable future.

Ellen misses the adventure and connection she felt while sailing, but she believes that her new message is more important. She says, ""I may have been the fastest person around the world, but this beats everything I've ever done.""<|eot_id|>"

Jordan Romero, a 13-year-old boy, is planning to climb Mount Everest, the highest mountain in the world. If he succeeds, he could become one of the most famous teenagers of his generation. Jordan wants to inspire other young people to spend more time outdoors and engage in adventurous activities. He is climbing Everest with his parents, Paul and Karen, who are also experienced climbers. They call themselves 'Team Romero'.

Jordan's goal is not only to climb Everest but also to climb the highest mountain on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He has already climbed five of them and hopes to finish the challenge before he turns 18. However, many experienced climbers have expressed concerns about Jordan's decision to climb Everest at such a young age. They think he may not be emotionally strong enough to handle the challenges of the climb.

Jordan's parents have heard these criticisms before, but they believe their own experience as climbers will help them navigate the risks. They also think Jordan is becoming stronger and more mature every day. Jordan's motivation for climbing Everest is not just to gain fame, but to achieve his goal. He focuses on the challenge and doesn't think about the attention he might receive.

The problem is that every adventure is now a competition, and Jordan has to make his climb a record-breaking one to get attention. This means he has to blog, take photos, and give interviews. His parents are aware of this and will stop the project if Jordan loses his motivation or decides to pursue a different interest.<|eot_id|>"

When you see a teenager with an MP3 player, it's unlikely they're listening to classical music. Most people can name many pop groups, but ask friends if they know who Brahms is, and they'll probably look puzzled. I'm studying music, but my classmates know as little about classical music as anyone else our age. If you don't know who composed the music, you're unlikely to buy their records. The statistics are worrying for classical music fans. Only 3% of concert tickets sold last year were for classical music events, and the average classical recording sells only 300 copies. I find this hard to believe. So, what has caused the decline in interest for a type of music that has been around for centuries? The older generation blames our obsession with TV and video games, but I don't think that's the main reason. The truth is that classical music doesn't appeal to most people, especially teenagers, who are the main music buyers. I know some teenagers who love classical music, but they're a minority. As a musician, I play in an orchestra, but I'm not a huge classical music fan. I enjoy many types of music, but my classical music collection is probably like that 3% figure. Why don't teenagers like classical music? First, the pace and rhythm of classical music are difficult for us. We like fast-paced activities, and classical music can be slow and complex. Additionally, we have trouble concentrating for more than three minutes, which is longer than most classical pieces. Pop music is simple and easy to listen to, while classical music requires time and attention. Pop music also deals with issues that are more relevant to teenagers. The way we listen to music has changed. In the past, families would make music together, and playing an instrument was valued. Nowadays, you can find any music online, and classical music is rarely part of our daily lives. When did you last hear classical music playing in a shop? My teacher says that classical concert audiences have increased recently, but I bet most of those new audience members are not teenagers. When we play classical music in different locations, I rarely see young people in the crowd. I don't know why people are more interested in classical music as they get older, but I do know that if your parents like something, you're less likely to be interested in it. Some people blame our schools for the lack of interest in classical music among teenagers, but there are many kids who enjoy playing classical music in school orchestras. They practice eagerly and stay after school to rehearse. Classical music appeals to them when they perform, but it's not their preferred choice otherwise. The two activities have become separate. When we want to relax, it's usually pop music we listen to.<|eot_id|>"

Bonnie Wyndham stepped out of her mother's car and looked at Almonside School. 'I'll show you who's boss,' she said, smiling. Her mother was getting out of the other door, but Bonnie didn't care if she overheard. Bonnie's mother knew her feelings well. Mrs. Wyndham took a moment to look around. Almonside School was an unusual place, with buildings hidden among the trees on a hillside. It was confusing at first, but then she saw the signs: Science block, gymnasium, riding centre... 'Riding centre,' Bonnie said, showing interest. 'The headmaster's office is that way,' her mother said. Bonnie followed her mother along a wide path between the trees. 'I wish you'd walk beside me instead of following me like a dog,' her mother said wearily, but she didn't expect Bonnie to do so.

A few minutes later, Bonnie's mother was talking to the headmaster in his office, while Bonnie waited outside. Bonnie suddenly stood up. 'Why should I just sit here?' she thought. 'I'll probably get kicked out anyway, so why not get it over with?' She left the building and headed towards the riding centre. There was a nice old building where the horses were kept, and a large indoor riding area. Bonnie looked around, but there was no one in sight. She approached the horses with respect, as she always did. The horses were well taken care of, and she could tell that right away. Almost every stall was occupied, and she walked along, looking at each horse and judging it. 'I know what they're doing here,' she told a small pony as she stroked its nose. The next horse caught her eye - a brown one with a touch of white. 'You're the best of the lot!' she said. He was lively, but Bonnie liked that. 'I have a feeling we've met before,' she said, stroking his neck. 'In my dreams, I was riding you to victory in a big competition...' Above the stall was his name: Maverick. Bonnie couldn't resist the urge to ride the horse. 'I wonder where I can find a bridle and a saddle,' she thought. The room with all the riding equipment was unlocked, and Bonnie was thrilled. She forgot all about her mother and the headmaster as she put a saddle on Maverick's back. When she sat up high on the horse outside, she felt like a queen, in charge of everything she could see. Her nickname at her old school was Queen Bee, and she laughed as she remembered it. 'You're the best horse I've ever ridden, Maverick,' she said, admiringly. 'And I'm not kidding, because I know about horses, even if I don't know about anything else.' She nudged him into a walk, then a trot. 'If I stay here, I think you and I could be great friends,' she said. She rode around the paddock, feeling exhilarated, the wind whipping past her cheek and making it glow. She knew Maverick trusted her, and she was certain he'd jump well.<|eot_id|>"

However, he didn't always focus on music. He was also an excellent swimmer and spent a lot of time surfing. When he was 13, he posted some videos of himself singing online, and they became very popular. This led to record labels contacting him, and he had to make a difficult decision: to continue swimming in Australia or take a risk and move to the US to pursue a music career. Cody chose the latter, which meant leaving his swimming coach and friends behind. He had to break the news to them, and it was a shock. Cody's family is not involved in his music career, but they are always there to support him. He sometimes worries about the impact his decision has had on his younger brother, who is eight years old and has to travel a lot for school.

I jumped out of bed, pulled back the curtain, and looked down at the river. A fresh crack in the ice sparkled in the morning sun. I shaded my eyes and looked upstream at the sandbags protecting the buildings from flooding as the river ice melted. I still felt sore from lifting them into place with the rest of the town's adults last week. My grandfather barely noticed my efforts. With one hand still on the curtain, I gazed along the dark, steaming water from the factory in Milltown. The ice shelves on either side of the dark patch were fragile, but solid ice lay downstream. As I got dressed in my kayaking gear, I spotted a boy on the opposite bank. I didn't recognize him. He was trying to balance on an ice shelf warmed by the factory. I zipped up my wetsuit and grabbed my jacket. I checked my pocket for the lucky chain my grandfather brought back from his expedition in South America. It's a family secret, known only to him, my mom, and me. I also keep his expedition diary under my pillow and read parts of it before bed. I patted the chain and headed to the kitchen. 'Good morning, Rex,' my mom said as I grabbed a banana. 'You're up early for a Saturday. I'll cook brunch after your training session. Be careful.' 'Thanks, Mom,' I replied. I headed down the hallway, almost bumping into my grandfather as he came out of his room. 'Can't you watch where you're going?' he snapped. 'Where are you going?' 'I'm going kayaking,' I said, as if it wasn't obvious. My grandfather is always grumpy, but lately, he's been making it harder for me to ignore him. 'What's the point of training if you didn't win the competition?' he said. For a moment, his words stung. But I took a deep breath and counted to three. He went into the bathroom, and my mom appeared with a sympathetic smile. 'Don't mind him, he's...not himself right now.' I finished the sentence for her. I try to be understanding, just like my mom. When I was a kid, he was my hero, and I still look up to him. But I have my own goals and ambitions now. My mom smiled. 'At least he's getting out of his room more. Have a good session, Rex. I admire your determination to keep going, even on cold days.' I smiled back and ate my banana. 'It'll be warmer in South America,' I said, 'if I can find sponsors for my expedition.' My mom laughed and went back to the kitchen. I finished my banana and headed to the boathouse.'

Mum caught Jess by the arm and said, 'Come with me.' Jess followed her to the study, where she saw an unfinished painting on the table. It was one of Grandpa's, but unlike anything he had done before. 'Do you know anything about this?' Mum asked. Jess shook her head. 'I've never seen it before. I didn't know he was working on anything.' Jess looked at the painting. It was a river, but not one she recognized. The riverbank was almost invisible, and the eye was drawn to the pale water. There were no animals, no birds, no people. The painting was strange and beautiful in an eerie way. Mum said, 'It has a name.' Jess knew why Mum was being casual and detached - Grandpa never gave his paintings names. Mum turned the painting over and pointed to the words 'River Boy'. Jess read them out loud. The words seemed important, but she didn't know why. There was a mystery. 'There is no boy,' Jess said. 'Exactly,' Mum replied. 'It's strange that Grandpa would be so specific. Maybe he'll add a boy later.' Mum had asked Grandpa about it, and he said that the artist doesn't need to explain their work. Each painting has its own life and language, and people either understand it or they don't. Mum was hoping Jess might know something about the painting, as she seemed to inspire Grandpa. But Jess knew that Grandpa didn't need her inspiration. He had been painting all his life.

I woke up this morning and accidentally cut a hole in my bedroom carpet. I didn't mean to, but it happened. I was trying to fit a small cabinet into a corner, but it didn't fit because my room is shaped like a wedge of cheese with only two corners. The cabinet is from my grandmother, and I was excited to receive it. It's a beautiful, small cabinet with pink and blue flowers and tiny glass doors. My grandmother used to keep china ornaments in it, and now I keep my collection of shells and fossils.

I was trying to fit the cabinet into a corner, but it was too tall for the angle between the roof and the floor.

Here is the simplified text:

""The novel 'The Borrowers' tells the story of a family of tiny people who live in the walls and floors of a house and 'borrow' things from the normal-sized people to survive. When I was asked to direct a TV adaptation of the novel, I knew it would be challenging to meet people's high expectations. I relied heavily on the original illustrations from the book to ensure accuracy. The author wanted the series to be told from the Borrowers' perspective, which made filming more complicated. The key was to get the scale right - the Borrowers are ten times smaller than humans, so we had to film them from a distance and use special techniques to capture their perspective. We even had to crawl on the ground to get the right shots.

One of the biggest challenges was combining the tiny Borrowers with the normal-sized surroundings. We developed a unique technique to achieve this. After the series was finished, the famous director George Lucas even called to ask how we did it.

We built a permanent set for the Borrowers' home under the floorboards, filled with giant objects to make the actors look small. The actors had to carry around giant props, which often made the crew laugh. In one scene, the Borrowers get swept down a drain, which was a thrilling experience for the actors. We also had to get the costumes right, making them out of heavy canvas material to make them look like dolls' clothes. This made it difficult for the actors to move around.

We filmed most of the scenes with the actors separated from their surroundings, using a blue screen and drawing pictures of each scene to guide them. It was a lot of hard work, but it all came together in the end, and I think the series was successful in capturing the magic of the books.""<|eot_id|>"

In the United States, the average teenage girl is expected to excel in many areas. She should be a good student, have a part-time job, volunteer, and be involved in extracurricular activities. Teenagers are under a lot of pressure to achieve a lot. They have a lot of homework, tests, and responsibilities at home, in addition to trying to maintain a social life.

Many people, including adults, forget how much pressure teenagers face today. Teenagers are often stereotyped as being lazy, disrespectful, rebellious, loud, reckless, and self-absorbed. However, not all teenagers fit this stereotype. Many are hardworking and responsible.

Some people assume that teenagers spend most of their time watching TV and using their cellphones. However, this is not always true. Teenagers use their cellphones as a tool to make their lives easier and more efficient. They can access information and complete their homework anywhere, anytime.

Teenagers have a lot on their plates. They often start their day early and end it late, with little time for leisure activities. According to a survey, only 20% of teenagers get the recommended nine hours of sleep a night. Many teenagers fall asleep in school because of sleep deprivation.

Despite the pressure and stereotypes, many teenagers are kind and caring. They volunteer and make a positive impact in their communities. One teenager, Lindamarie Olsen, says that her favorite part of the week is volunteering. She believes that the stereotype of teenagers as selfish is not accurate.

In the future, the stereotype of teenagers may change, but one thing is certain - they will continue to surprise people and make a positive impact on the world.<|eot_id|>"

The Earth to Sky Calculus Club is a group of teenagers from Bishop, a small town surrounded by wilderness in the US. They have launched over 50 high-altitude balloons into space, a project that combines astronomy, adventure, and science. I joined them on a weekend in late spring to see how they do it.

This time, they were launching a balloon to record shooting stars. These are caused by small rocks or pieces of metal entering the Earth's atmosphere and producing a trail of light. To prepare, they attached a camera, an altitude meter, and a thermometer to a lunch box, which was then secured to the balloon. Two GPS trackers were also attached to help them find the balloon later.

The balloon was inflated with a special gas tank, which was donated by a local enthusiast. The group had to work together to get the tank, and one member even made a seven-hour round trip to get it. When the balloon was ready, they counted down and released it. The students then tracked its path with flashlights, watching as it rose into the night sky.

After the launch, most of the students went home, but a few stayed to watch for shooting stars. They lay on blankets on the mountainside, gazing up at the incredibly clear sky. One boy fell asleep in his sleeping bag, while the others whispered about how they were the only ones talking.

As the night wore on, the group waited for the balloon to pop and return to Earth. It eventually did, and the students used the GPS trackers to find it the next day. Getting the lunch box back wasn't easy, as it had landed in a remote area. The group's leader explained that part of the fun is the challenge of recovering the equipment.

On this occasion, the lunch box had landed 84 km west of Bishop, and the recovery team had to drive and hike to get to it. They eventually found it in a canyon, high on a flat rock, near a waterfall. Although the camera hadn't recorded any shooting stars, the group was happy to discuss the science behind atmospheric waves and how they affect the stars. It was also another exciting story to share with others.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Chloe Morgan never thought she'd be interested in science, especially not palaeontology. However, it all changed when she was 15 years old. Her younger brother was going through a dinosaur phase, and she reluctantly helped him with a school project. When she read an article about recent discoveries in the field, she was amazed and knew she wanted to pursue it.

I'm curious to know what inspired her to choose this path, as palaeontology wasn't a common career choice for young people at the time. She recalls meeting her first professional palaeontologist, Matt Cornelius, who was famous and approachable. Despite her initial nervousness, she felt at ease when he showed patience and willingness to listen.

I ask her about the portrayal of palaeontologists in movies and TV shows. Chloe frowns, saying that while films like Jurassic Park have sparked public interest in dinosaurs, they often stereotype palaeontologists as eccentric geniuses or geeky losers. In reality, her job is varied and includes digging up dinosaur bones, analyzing fossils, and writing scientific papers.

Chloe also spends time communicating scientific findings to the public and explaining complex concepts to young people. She believes it's essential to dispel myths and misconceptions about science and encourages young people to explore the natural world. The recent TV documentary Walking with Dinosaurs was an opportunity for her to influence how dinosaurs are portrayed on screen.

I ask why dinosaurs continue to fascinate us. Chloe thinks they speak to our innate sense of exploration and discovery. At a time when our world seems to be shrinking, prehistoric creatures remind us that there's still more to be discovered. And for her, palaeontology is a form of time travel.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

When you're on a long car trip with your family, especially when you're a child, you know you're not there yet, even when you ask 'Are we there yet?' repeatedly. However, once you finally arrive, it's not 'there' anymore; it's 'here'. So, if you really think you're 'there' yet, you should ask 'Are we here yet?' instead. Parents often wish they could escape the constant 'Are we there yet?' questions during long car rides.

As a kid, you get to relax in the backseat, watching movies, listening to music, or doing puzzles while the scenery passes by. You might even get to be the co-pilot, helping with the navigation and making requests. But, of course, there's always someone who wants to stir up trouble. In my case, my brother Tim would often do something annoying, like putting his foot on my side of the seat. This would lead to a fight, and our parents would have to intervene, reminding us to respect each other's personal space.

Over the years, my dad developed some clever ways to deal with us kids on long car rides. For instance, when I asked 'Are we there yet?', he would say, 'We're here. Get out of the car.' When I pointed out that we were still on the highway, he'd respond, 'Well, then maybe we're not there yet.' This would keep us quiet for a while. You know you've finally arrived when you see the grown-ups rushing away from the car, eager to escape the chaos.

So, remember: if your parents are still nearby, the answer to 'Are we there yet?' is always 'no'. You're not there yet.<|eot_id|>"

John and Zuzi Morgan have opened a café in Oxford where people can enjoy coffee, cake, and board games. They want to create a unique experience that brings people together and encourages social interaction. Zuzi explains that they were motivated to start the café because people are spending too much time staring at their phones and devices. They wanted to create a space where people can connect with each other and have fun.

The type of games played in their café are called Eurogames, which have gentle themes like farming and landscape-building. The first Eurogame was The Settlers of Catan, created by a German designer. Players work together to build settlements and trade resources, keeping everyone engaged and excited until the end.

The co-operative games that followed allowed players to work together as a team, promoting even more social interaction. Pandemic, a popular Eurogame, was created by Matt Leacock, who was inspired by a game called Lord of the Rings. Leacock's passion for board games started when he was a child, but he was often disappointed with the games he played. He began designing his own games with the help of his uncle, and his game Pandemic became a huge success.

The growth of the video game industry has actually helped the popularity of board games. Many people who play video games are now open to playing board games too. As a result, tabletop gaming has become a way for people to connect with each other in the real world, rather than just online. John and Zuzi's café is a great example of this trend, and it's likely to continue growing in popularity.

Jamie Scott has written and produced many successful songs in the UK. His story shows how important it is to be persistent and patient in the music industry, even if your career doesn't start as planned. He says his mother was an excellent singer who encouraged him to play the guitar. The only music he listened to at home was a local radio station that played music for older people, which influenced his taste in music as he grew up. He didn't hear a contemporary song until he was 12. At the same time, he had to choose between playing tennis at a high level and pursuing music. He decided to focus on music, spending his lunch breaks at school working on songs on the piano.

At 17, Jamie left school to try to become a performer. He formed a duo with a friend who was a good guitarist, but they didn't share the same passion for performing. Jamie's parents gave him 18 months to make it in the music industry, and if he didn't succeed, he would have to get a job. After a few close calls with record labels, Jamie was signed to a music publisher at 19, thanks to one of his songs. However, record labels only wanted him as a solo artist, so he had to split with his friend.

Jamie eventually found success behind the scenes, rather than on stage. He was signed to a record label in the UK, but it didn't work out, so he switched to another label. Despite this, he didn't achieve fame and fortune. Jamie believes that as a writer, he has been in the right place at the right time. He has become one of the main writers in the UK that record labels send to up-and-coming artists, helping them launch their careers. Jamie thinks it's okay to write songs that are likely to be popular and sell well, and he has no problem being honest about his goals. He just wants to write songs that are amazing and will be loved by many people.

Tony Connor is a well-known figure online, but not necessarily among people who don't follow extreme sports videos. He's a professional street trials cyclist, known for performing incredible stunts on his bike. These stunts are filmed and shared online. When I met him, we went to a BMX park on a Saturday morning. The local kids knew who he was, and even some adults came to pay their respects, calling him a 'legend'. After seeing him in action, I have to agree. Despite my initial skepticism, I was impressed by his courage, creativity, and willingness to take risks. Before each stunt, he explains what he's trying to do, and I'm often amazed he'll actually pull it off. Afterward, I complimented him, but he seemed unimpressed. Despite his online fame, Tony is reluctant to be a celebrity. He finds the social aspect difficult and prefers to focus on his skills rather than talking about them. His fame is due to social media and lightweight camera technology, which allows him to make a living doing what he loves. However, he's not complaining. He's grateful for the opportunities this technology provides.

I've learned from many years of interviewing top athletes that there are two key factors that turn a passionate child into an elite competitor: energy and the ability to overcome emotional disappointment. These qualities are more important than talent and enable athletes to persist even in the face of failure. The riskier the sport, the more crucial it is to have mental strength. Even in the park, Tony fell a few times when facing obstacles that were unfamiliar to him. He simply got up and kept trying until he mastered them. Some people criticize Tony for being reckless, but he argues that they don't understand the technical aspects of his sport and the measures he takes to minimize risks. He's not careless about the risks he takes and spends hours planning and preparing for each stunt. He knows he needs to stay focused and not let fear take over.<|eot_id|>"

Television presenter Helen Skelton has taken on many challenging charity projects. For her latest adventure, she walked on a thin metal wire, 66 meters above the ground, between two power station towers. There was no safety net, only a belt around her waist attached to a wire above. To stay balanced, she carried a heavy stick weighing 8 kilograms. Helen received training from an experienced high-wire walker. Although she had some circus skills, she quickly realized that high-wire walking was much more demanding. 'The training was a shock', she said. 'I didn't know how strong I'd need to be. Every day started with a morning run up a steep hill, followed by an hour of exercises and another hour of practice on the wire. I also had to learn how to fall safely onto the wire in case I slipped. It was painful every time I fell, but I had to stay positive. If I got nervous and started shaking, the wire would too.'

On the day of the challenge, it was windy, but Helen controlled her nerves by taking deep breaths as she took each step along the wire. The 150-meter walk took 15 minutes. 'That was the scariest thing I've done', she admitted afterwards. 'I'm glad it's over!' Despite the experience, Helen is already planning her next charity project: to reach the South Pole by skiing, kiting, and biking.

Changes made:

* Simplified vocabulary: ""dangerous challenges"" -> ""challenging charity projects"", ""empty power station"" -> ""power station towers"", ""long thin piece of metal"" -> ""thin metal wire""

In 2006, Jeff Somers embarked on a remarkable journey around the world on a penny farthing, an old-fashioned bicycle with one large and one small wheel. Having previously written a book about his experiences traveling across Canada in a 50-year-old car, Jeff was an avid motor sports enthusiast and worked as an engine builder. To save money, he would often ride his old bicycle to work and even used it to travel to Amsterdam for holidays. This trip sparked an idea in him: ""I decided to see the world by bike."" Jeff wanted a unique touring bike and decided to build one himself. He chose a penny farthing, which he had always been fascinated by. After two failed attempts in 2001 and 2003 due to a knee injury, Jeff finally set out on his journey in 2006. Over the next three years, he traveled through 23 countries on four continents. The highlight of his trip was arriving in Tibet and seeing Mount Everest. Although he met cyclists who could ride up mountains, which he couldn't, Jeff never regretted his choice of penny farthing. As he traveled further away from home, people's amazement at his unusual bike only grew. However, his worst experience was when he had to drink contaminated water from a stream, which led to a serious fever that left him bedridden for ten days without access to medicine. Despite the challenges, Jeff would still consider embarking on another adventure on his penny farthing if he could afford it.

I work at a university in the US, where my team and I are studying a type of water bird called the American black duck. We're particularly concerned about their numbers, which have drastically decreased, and we're unsure if there's enough food for them on the east coast. While we have a lot of information about their daytime behavior, we know very little about their nighttime habits. That's because we didn't have the necessary equipment until now. Our new 'night-vision scope' allows us to take clear pictures, even on moonless nights, which will help us make better decisions about protecting their habitat. It's a challenging project. There are four of us, and we work six hours a day. We've studied ducks in different locations, and I've had to take a boat to some sites to observe and take notes. The weather hasn't been ideal, with some nights being mild and others wet. It's also very quiet, so I need a lot of coffee to stay awake. We've only missed one day of work so far due to heavy snow. Despite the challenges, I enjoy the project, especially compared to what's ahead - spending hours in a laboratory analyzing our findings. It won't be easy to be cooped up indoors, but it's essential for our research. And I wouldn't trade it for anything!

When I tell people what I do for a living, they often can't believe it's a real job. But it's true - I spend my days at work eating chocolate! As part of my job, I taste chocolate to ensure that the company I work for produces high-quality bars. Every week, I receive small samples from our factory and check them for taste, texture, and smell. I also taste the raw materials we use, such as nuts and fruit, to choose the best ones for our chocolate. In my office, I have a kitchen where I can test and taste products. I also share samples with my colleagues, which keeps them happy! My kitchen is equipped with machines and ingredients, and it's great to have a private space to work in. No two days are the same in my job. Sometimes I work in our food lab, and other times I travel abroad to buy raw materials. As a parent, this can be challenging, but I love the variety and unpredictability of my job. The only question I get asked most often is whether I ever get tired of chocolate.

Have you ever imagined what it's like to perform in a circus? Sophia Grayson, from Circus Experience, teaches young people circus skills. She says her course is popular because it includes many different skills, such as juggling, trapeze, and even fire tricks. On the one-year course, students gradually take on more challenging activities, and parents are welcome to attend some classes to see their progress.

To be a successful circus performer, it's essential to keep things fresh and exciting. Practicing regularly is crucial, and it's also important to be fit and healthy, just like athletes. The best performers are those who are dedicated to improving their skills and have a strong desire to succeed.

Some people might think that circus performers are prone to injuries or only work for short periods. However, the biggest challenge is planning for the future, as performers can only travel and perform while they're young. After that, they need to consider other options.

The course also covers business planning, and many previous students have set up successful businesses around the world. Sophia warns that being a circus performer is not a lucrative profession, as it often means irregular income and intense competition. However, it can be a lot of fun!

You may not know Mariam Hobson's name, but you've probably heard her many times. She's a professional backing singer, which means she sings behind the main singer. Some people think backing singers aren't good enough to be lead singers, but that's not true. They actually have to be more talented. Mariam is one of the best in the industry.

What Mariam loves about her job is that she never knows what she'll be asked to sing when she walks into the recording studio. It could be classical, jazz, hip-hop, or rock music. Sometimes she's even asked to sing in a funny way, like singing like a fish underwater! Mariam never argues with the producers; she just gets on with the job.

To be a good backing singer, you need excellent musical skills and the ability to learn quickly. Mariam often has to learn new songs without any written music to help her. She remembers her first experience recording music for a film was very challenging. There were eight singers, each singing a different tune, and an orchestra as well. Mariam was nervous because if she made a mistake, they would have to record everything again. Recording sessions can be long enough without having to redo parts.

One of Mariam's favorite jobs is working with songwriters. Less experienced writers often don't know what kind of music suits a female voice best. By listening to Mariam sing their song, they can learn how to improve it.<|eot_id|>"

Julie Deane started a successful business by creating traditional satchels, a type of bag commonly used by schoolchildren. Her satchels are now sold in famous stores and are popular among celebrities. Before starting her business, Julie considered different options, such as cake decorating and party planning, before deciding on satchels. However, not everyone agreed with her decision, with some saying there was no demand for them. Julie was convinced that there was a market for her product and involved her family in the business from the start. Her mother, who had never had a career, showed a natural talent for business, and the design of the satchels was inspired by children's storybooks.

Julie didn't know much about fashion blogs at first, but she soon realized their importance to her success. She started by sending satchels to fashion writers and bloggers, hoping they would write about them. This helped create interest in her product, and as a result, her company has been able to grow rapidly. Julie is now excited to see which celebrities will be seen carrying her satchels. Unlike other companies, Julie doesn't spend money on online advertising. Instead, she uses social media to get inspiration for new designs and keep her products fresh and exciting.

There was a difficult time when a competitor copied Julie's design, but she has since taken steps to ensure that her production team is as reliable as her own staff.

Ana's first time singing in front of an audience was at school, but she was so nervous that her teacher had to help her off the stage. The teacher suggested she join the school theatre club, which helped her build confidence. She sang with 50 other students at a school concert and later wrote her first song, ""Falling Stars,"" for her brother's band.

Ana enjoyed writing so much that she took a songwriting course with a professional songwriter. Despite being the youngest student, she already knew a lot about music. However, the teacher didn't pay attention to her ideas, which frustrated her. She wrote a song called ""Something to Say"" about her feelings and posted it online. It became very popular, with many people commenting that they loved it and found new meanings in the lyrics each time they listened.

Joss Alton, the owner of Isotope Music, flew from the other side of Ireland to ask Ana to join his company. At first, Ana was hesitant, as she didn't know much about the company and didn't want someone telling her what to sing. However, Joss reassured her that she would have creative freedom, and soon she performed at a concert in Dublin organized by Isotope. The concert was a huge success, and Ana enjoyed it immensely.

Ana prefers writing about personal experiences, especially when life is challenging.

Last year, I went on an incredible journey with my brother Harry. He's a journalist, and he wanted to write articles about our trip. He's also passionate about boats, which is not an interest I share. However, I had always been fascinated by the west coast of Canada, where our great-grandparents used to live. I had seen it on TV as a child and had always wanted to visit. So, I kept asking Harry if I could join him, and eventually, he agreed.

Before we left, there were storms in the area, but the forecast looked good for the time we were going to be there. I was busy at work and didn't have much time to think about the preparations, but Harry assured me that everything was taken care of.

When we arrived in Canada, we joined the group and set off on our journey. The guide told us that there were very few people living along that coast, and we only saw dolphins and birds on our first morning. We knew there were islands in the distance, but the fog made it hard to see far, so I focused on the beautiful patterns our boat made in the water.

We often stopped for hours to explore the rock pools on the beaches, which were full of colorful fish I had never seen before. It was great to be able to relax and not worry about time. We always made time for lunch and dinner, which we cooked together over campfires. When we went to sleep on the boats each evening, it felt like a stress-free lifestyle.

When it was time to leave, I was sad to go back to normal life. I knew I would miss my family and friends, but I was also looking forward to sharing our adventures with them.

My father was a professional basketball player in Germany, just like his father before him. I used to watch his games when I was a kid. You might think that watching so many matches would make me love the sport, but actually, it had the opposite effect. I loved bragging to my friends about how good my dad was, especially when he won. But I usually brought a book with me to read instead of watching the game.

When I started secondary school, I was still two years away from being a teenager, but I was already 2 meters tall. My sports teacher noticed my height and asked if I'd be interested in training with the basketball team. I enjoyed the session, but I thought I needed to improve my skills before playing in a real game. My teacher was more confident in me than I was, so it took me a while to agree. A few weeks later, I found myself playing against another school. My parents coming to watch made me more nervous, but it was okay in the end.

For the next four years, I practiced every day and did really well. I even joined an adult team before moving to a special sports academy in the USA when I was 15. The coach there trained Olympic basketball players, and it was great to work with him. However, I have to admit that I didn't enjoy my first experience of living far from my parents. At home, I never had much time for my friends due to all the training, so it wasn't a big change for me. But I got used to my new life, and my English improved quickly too! I turned professional at 18, three years after moving to the USA. I was taller than most players in the league, but I was too light for my height, so I had to work on that first.

Seven years ago, I was studying tourism in college, but I needed a part-time job to help pay my tuition fees. I decided to become a weekend tour guide in my hometown, Chicago. This was a great experience, as I got to show visitors around the city and discover new things about it. After completing my studies, I decided to make tour guiding my full-time career. However, I soon realized that becoming a licensed guide required a lot more knowledge than I had initially thought. To get certified, I needed to be able to answer hundreds of questions about Chicago's history, architecture, and public transportation. After several months of hard work, I obtained my guide qualification and started working as an independent guide.

Being a tour guide is not just about knowing facts and keeping track of the group. It also requires being able to entertain and tell engaging stories, as well as being able to adapt to unexpected situations. For instance, if a place is closed or a route changes, I need to be able to think on my feet and come up with a solution. Tourists don't want to hear about the problems or what they're missing out on; they just want to enjoy their tour. My goal is to make sure they have a great time, so they'll leave a positive review online. As a tour guide, I know that reviews are crucial, as they can attract more customers. To ensure this, I strive to make my tours fun and stress-free. My enthusiasm and energy are key to my success, and my reviews are usually very positive, which leads to my tours being recommended to other visitors to Chicago.

My name is Ella, and I'm 22 years old. Last year, I went to Thailand with my sister Josie. We're not too far apart in age, and despite our differences, we get along well. We volunteered at an elephant sanctuary, where we helped take care of sick and rescued elephants. At first, I was worried that we wouldn't fit in with the other volunteers, who were much older than us. We were also nervous because it was our first time doing something like this. However, we quickly settled in and found that we had a lot in common with the others.

Our main task was to collect food for the elephants. They eat a lot of grass and banana plants, so it took most of the day. Josie found it challenging, but seeing the elephants enjoy their meal made it worth it for me. We also helped wash the elephants in the river using big brushes and soap. I had a lot of fun, even though I got wetter than the elephants!

The part of the day I looked forward to the most was the evening. We would lead the elephants into the forest under the light of the moon. All the volunteers stayed in the same house, and Josie and I shared a bedroom. We didn't have much space, but it was our decision because Josie didn't want to be alone. The weather was hot and humid, especially at night, but we expected that. The meals were delicious and didn't include meat, which we both prefer.

In the evenings, we would talk and play games with the other volunteers and staff. Now that we're back in the UK, Josie doesn't talk about Thailand much. However, if someone asks her if she enjoyed her time at the sanctuary, she says she loved it. I'm not sure if she's being completely honest, though. I think she might be a bit annoyed with herself for not making the most of her time because she missed her friends. But when she looks back, she can see how lucky she was to have gone. Maybe she'll go back one day – I certainly will!<|eot_id|>"

My name is Gina D'Costa and I run a flower shop in the UK. We don't just sell flowers to people who want them for their homes or as gifts. Hotels, offices, and even businesses use flowers for decoration and advertising. I've even decorated a castle with flowers for a wedding! It was a lot of work, but I was very proud of what we achieved.

My day starts at 4 am, when I go to the flower market to buy fresh flowers. It's not always easy, as it's often cold and dark, but I don't let that bother me. The market is amazing, with flowers from all over the world. Choosing the right flowers can be tricky, as there are so many options and different smells. I have to think about what I like and what my customers want.

Sometimes, I have to negotiate prices with the flower sellers, which can be challenging. Flowers aren't cheap, so I need to get the best price possible. Back at the shop, we arrange the flowers in vases and create bunches. We also work out how much each order will cost. Some customers are surprised by how much flowers cost, and I have to ask them to reconsider their choices. I enjoy thinking about how I can create the most beautiful flowers for the money my customers want to spend. That's what I love about my job - I wouldn't want to do anything else!<|eot_id|>"

My city has a modern cinema that shows the latest films and children's films on weekends. It's close to my home, but I noticed that there was something missing - the opportunity to discuss a film with others after watching it. So, I started a film club with two friends. We decided not to rent a cinema, but instead choose a different location in the city each month. For example, we showed a film set in Antarctica in an old factory, which created a unique atmosphere. Some locations are free because the owners make money by selling snacks during the film, which allows us to keep our prices low. We're happy to break even, not making a profit. Each time we show a film, things get easier for us, especially since we have our own reliable equipment. We also know how many tickets we've sold online, so we don't have to worry about empty seats. People of all ages come to discuss the film after it's shown, which is wonderful. Our website has been helpful, and we're now in touch with other film clubs across the country. We've visited other clubs to see how they do things, but it's always great to come back to our own club. We've also started a blog because most people look for information about films online. We've put up posters in cafes, but word of mouth is still the most effective way to promote our club. The audience enjoys the special activities we organize with each film, such as a movie quiz last month, which everyone enjoyed.

As a child, I loved taking photographs. When I turned 15, I wanted to take my hobby to the next level, so I decided to take one photo every day for a year. Many other young photographers had done this before, but I thought it was a great idea. After a few weeks, I put my photos on a website for young photographers to share and get feedback. I was surprised to find that others liked my style and appreciated my unique perspective. I enjoyed photographing different subjects, but someone suggested that having a common theme would make my project stronger. I decided to focus on nature scenes, particularly birds and the sky. Most of my photos were in black and white, which was different from what others were doing. At times, I doubted my project and almost gave up, but I trusted my instincts and became more confident in my style. My art teacher suggested entering a national photography competition for young people, so I did. I was thrilled when I won first prize, which boosted my confidence and made me realize that my photography was good enough to make a career out of it. Today, I have my own photography studio and I've never regretted my choice.<|eot_id|>"

I joined the National Youth Challenge (NYC) last year because I wanted to try new things like camping and sailing, and learn skills like public speaking. The NYC offers various activities to challenge yourself and learn new things. There are different levels, from beginner to advanced, led by adult volunteers. When you complete each level, you get a certificate. When I first joined, my leader suggested that my first challenge should be helping to organize activities at a local children's club for two hours a week. I was hesitant at first, as I had previously struggled to make friends at the same club when I was younger. However, I decided to take on the challenge to earn my first certificate. Surprisingly, I soon found that I really enjoyed it and wanted to spend more time at the club. It became more important to me than just getting the certificate. After completing the challenge, the NYC leader allowed me to continue volunteering at the club, as I had built strong relationships with the children. Now, I volunteer for about four hours a week and always look forward to it. The experience at the children's club has inspired me to consider a career as a youth worker, which I had never thought about before. I've also improved my communication skills while helping others. I've earned several NYC certificates, including one for camping.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

I was born in Denver, USA and started snowboarding at the age of eight. My dad took me to a resort in the mountains, which was about two hours from Denver. The hill was very steep, so my dad had to convince me to try it. I was too young to ask if I could start snowboarding, but my dad was already passionate about it and wanted me to love it too. He made it look easy, and in the end, I managed to do it. After that experience, I developed a strong passion for snowboarding and improved my skills quickly. I started competing at the age of ten. Some people get bored of competing, but my love for snowboarding has only grown stronger as I've gotten older. I enjoy not having a fixed plan, and sometimes this works out well, like when I became the first female to achieve a perfect score at a local competition. I wasn't sure if I would attempt the jumps until I started doing them. This achievement increased my confidence in my abilities.

During the summer, I focus on training and my studies, as there is no snow. Although I train daily, it's nice not having to follow a strict diet like I do in the winter. I also get to spend a lot of time with my friends. It's a good way to deal with not being able to do what I love as much during the winter. I need to think carefully about my future. Snowboarding is a big part of my life now, but I also think it's important to have something else I can do, just in case I don't succeed as a professional snowboarder or get injured. I'm considering becoming a doctor, but I'm not sure if I have time for a college degree with my active lifestyle. It's hard to imagine myself getting tired of snowboarding, but I can't do it forever.

When I was 15, I wanted everything my friends had, and I didn't plan for the future. I had no idea what I wanted to do after school. One day, my best friend got a new phone for her birthday, and I thought I needed one too. My parents said I could have it if I paid for it myself, so I started working part-time to save up. My parents taught me a valuable lesson by making me work. I worked every Saturday at a café, but I didn't enjoy it. My parents suggested I start my own business instead. I had seen my mum making necklaces for herself, so I asked if I could try too. I was surprised to find it easy, as it had seemed complicated when I watched my mum. My friends thought it was boring, but I was excited. My mum showed me how to make something attractive at home with basic tools and materials. I sold my first pieces of jewelry to my friends and family. They said they liked them, but I wasn't convinced they were good enough to sell to the public. To find out, my mum and I rented a market stall. We sold a lot to tourists, who bought them as gifts for their family and friends. Soon, we were getting calls from all over the country asking to buy more. People thought we were a big company, but we were just two people on a market stall! That's when I knew it could work, and it was time to take the next step – creating a website. Now, I've made thousands of pounds from my business, mostly online, and we still have our market stall. It's been a lot of fun so far.

Janine Stuart wrote her first novel, Being Amelia, when she was just 13 years old. The book became a bestseller. Janine based the story on her own life, drawing from her experiences of moving around the country with her family. She said in an interview, 'Because we moved around a lot, I learned to make new friends easily. I understand what it's like to be the only new student in a class, which helped me write about Amelia's experiences in a new school.'

Janine started writing the book during a summer holiday when she was feeling bored. Her mother had always wanted to be a writer, and her teachers encouraged her to write, so it seemed like a natural thing to do. The year before, Janine had won a short story competition, which gave her the confidence to send her novel to a publishing company. They loved it, and a year later, the book was on the shelves in bookstores.

A reviewer praised the book, saying that despite the happy-looking cover, the characters in the story face some tough challenges, which makes them more believable. The reviewer was impressed that Janine, who is still very young, has shown that she is a better writer than some well-known authors. Janine is still getting used to being a famous writer, but she's learned to cope with recognition in public. She advises other young writers to find what works for them, and for her, hanging out with friends is a great way to get inspiration for her writing.

I'm Tom, 15 years old, and my family and I moved into a castle on a small island three years ago. My dad got a job as the castle's manager, taking care of historical buildings and making them accessible to the public. We were all excited, but also a bit worried about leaving our cozy home and school behind. We were concerned about the castle's living conditions and the lack of school on the island. However, we quickly adapted to island life. The castle isn't the most beautiful, but our apartment is comfortable. In summer, the island is lively with many visitors, and we often have parties on the beach. In winter, we mostly see the other families who live on the island, and there aren't many teenagers. The adults are very supportive and help each other with repairs, which can be hard work. The biggest change for me was having to travel by boat every day to school. I was looking forward to the stormy days, but the ferries don't run then. If I miss the bus to the harbor after school, I also miss the last ferry home, which is worrying. When friends come to visit, I tell them to hurry up! We often get amazing views, like when the sun sets over the sea. Sometimes, though, it's foggy, and then suddenly it's sunny again – it's still amazing. We do get bad storms, and I wonder if the castle is strong enough to withstand them. But then I remember it's been here for centuries and is still standing.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

I live in a beautiful countryside in Scotland, surrounded by nature. I've always loved animals and the outdoors, so I started birdwatching six years ago. I went on a trip to the Scottish mountains with my family and saw many birds in their natural habitat. My parents taught me how to identify different species and find the best spots to see them. I was amazed, and after that, I joined a local birdwatching club for young people. My goal is to spot 200 different bird species, and I've almost reached it. When I go on family holidays abroad, I look for places with birdwatching activities so I can add new species to my list. I've been to Egypt and South America, where I tried to spot my 200th species, but it didn't happen. However, I've learned that patience is important in birdwatching. I posted a video about my challenge online, and many teenagers thought it was an interesting hobby. My teachers liked it so much that they asked me to give a presentation about birdwatching at school. I was a bit nervous, but I knew what to say and had notes to help me. After the presentation, my teachers said I did a great job, and I might even do another one next year.

I'm lucky to live in the countryside, where there are plenty of birds to see. I think many city teenagers might not think of birdwatching, but there are actually many birds in green areas. I also think that birdwatching clubs should encourage more young people to join. Everyone should connect with nature, regardless of age, and it doesn't have to be expensive.

I played in local tournaments and caught the attention of a professional women's team. The manager asked me to join the team, and I started training with them when I was just 13. I improved a lot, but some people still doubted I could become a star player. This made me feel a bit down. However, my coach encouraged me to believe in myself and just be myself. He even let me play in a championship match earlier than expected. I was nervous, but I played my best game and scored the winning goal. The team carried me around the pitch, and it was an amazing feeling. Since then, I've scored many more winning goals. Next month, I'm organizing a football tournament in my area to encourage teenagers to play and show them what it takes to be a professional player.

Here is a simplified version of the text, adapted for a C1 learner:

One of the most significant developments in higher education over the past few years is the emphasis on involving students in research from an early stage. This recognizes that research is not just for renowned scholars or scientists, but a natural way to build knowledge and skills. Research skills will be valuable not only in your studies but also in your future career, as they involve critical thinking and problem-solving.

As a student, you contribute to knowledge by asking questions and seeking answers. You don't just absorb information; you create it. Making knowledge involves asking questions like ""Why?"", ""How?"", and ""What if?"" instead of simply accepting what you're told. These questions are at the heart of research.

Research can take many forms, from groundbreaking, complex projects to everyday investigations. At its core, research is about asking thoughtful questions, exploring problems, and seeking answers. You've likely been conducting research in some form since you started studying or working. For example, you may have researched where to go on holiday, how to fix a problem, or how to choose the right product online.

In higher education, it's expected that you'll develop your research skills by questioning established knowledge, evaluating information, and constructing your own responses. Some students may struggle with this, as they may be used to accepting what they're told by authorities. However, in UK, US, European, and Australasian higher education, it's encouraged to question established knowledge and authorities.

Critical thinking is essential in research. While it's important to consider the research of others, you need to engage with it, think critically, and evaluate the evidence. Don't just accept what you're told; instead, test ideas, identify potential biases, and consider alternative perspectives.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 learner:

Cities have long been hubs of intellectual activity, from 18th-century coffeehouses in London to modern-day cafes in Paris, where artists like Pablo Picasso would discuss their work. However, city life is not without its challenges. The same cafes that sparked lively discussions also spread diseases like cholera, and even Picasso eventually left the city to live in the countryside. Despite its creative potential, the modern city can be an overwhelming and unnatural environment. Scientists have started to study how cities affect our brains, and the results are surprising. While it's well-known that city life can be exhausting, research suggests that cities can actually dull our thinking, sometimes significantly. One key factor is the lack of nature. Studies have shown that hospital patients recover faster when they can see trees from their windows. Even brief glimpses of nature can improve cognitive performance, as they provide a mental break from the urban routine.

As humans have become increasingly urbanized, with the majority now living in cities, it's essential to understand the impact of this environment on our mental and physical health. The constant stimuli in cities can be mentally draining, as our brains need to constantly redirect our attention. This is because cities are overcrowded and noisy, with many distractions competing for our attention. In contrast, natural settings don't require as much mental effort, as they provide a sense of calm and relaxation.

The concept of attention restoration theory, developed by psychologist Stephen Kaplan, suggests that immersion in nature can have a restorative effect on our minds. Natural environments are full of objects that capture our attention, but they don't trigger negative emotions, allowing our mental machinery to relax and replenish itself.

Despite the challenges posed by city life, cities continue to thrive as hubs of intellectual activity. Research has shown that the very same features that can trigger lapses in attention and memory – crowded streets and close proximity to others – also contribute to urban creativity. The concentration of social interactions is what drives innovation, as seen in cities like Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is a hotbed of technological innovation. The key is to find a balance between the benefits of city life and the need for mental relaxation and restoration.

Here is the simplified text:

The question of where the mind is located is an interesting one. Many people assume that thinking takes place inside our heads, and modern brain imaging techniques have confirmed this. However, I believe that the study of the mind should not stop at the skin or skull. There is a wealth of evidence from archaeology that shows that objects, as well as neurons, play a crucial role in human cognitive life. From ancient times to the present, humans have used tools, symbols, and other objects to help us think and make sense of the world.

It's easy to see why the mind and brain are often equated, as most research has focused on isolating people from their surroundings to study their brains. However, this approach overlooks the fact that much of our thinking takes place outside our heads. I'm not questioning the importance of the brain, but rather suggesting that the mind is more than just the brain.

Instead, I propose that human intelligence extends beyond the skin into the material world. This is the idea behind my theory, Material Engagement Theory (MET). MET explores how objects become extensions of our bodies and minds, and how this has changed over time. It also looks at how these changes have shaped the way we think.

For example, consider a blind person using a stick to navigate. Where does their sense of self begin and end? The stick becomes an extension of their body, and their brain treats it as part of themselves. This example illustrates the plasticity of the human mind, which is capable of reorganizing itself in response to new experiences and technologies.

My approach sees the human mind as an ongoing project, constantly evolving and changing as we interact with the world around us. This is what I call metaplasticity – our minds are shaped by the material world, and we, in turn, shape the world through our creations.

I believe that it's time to recognize the importance of material culture in shaping our minds and thoughts. By incorporating materiality into our understanding of cognition, we can gain a deeper understanding of how humans have used technology to transform themselves and their environment throughout history.<|eot_id|>"

Photography has had a profound impact on our understanding of the world and our way of life. In the United States, photography quickly became an integral part of the country's culture, influencing various aspects of life, from science and industry to art and entertainment. Historians consider photography to be the US's most significant contribution to the visual arts. This is a significant claim, but it reflects the importance of photography in US intellectual and aesthetic discourse.

Photography's appeal can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, its mechanical process matched the growing enthusiasm for technology, which was a part of American culture. The camera brought the world into people's homes, making it possible to see and experience things that were previously inaccessible. Secondly, the camera was a tool for representing oneself, allowing people to present their image to the public in a country where individual and national identities were constantly evolving. Thirdly, the camera played a crucial role in creating and sustaining family memories, providing a record of one's life and family history.

Photography's realism was also in line with the tendency towards realism in American art. Every photograph is a way of drawing attention to something, and each image conveys a message. The fact that photographs are made by machines adds a unique characteristic: they are records of events, people, and things, and as such, they embody a certain objectivity. However, photographs can also carry an element of subjectivity, depending on the photographer's perspective.

To understand a photograph, it is essential to consider its purpose and function within a particular cultural context. Why was the photograph taken? How did people initially perceive it? Moreover, the same image can have different meanings in different contexts and cultures. The camera's importance to artists has become increasingly acknowledged, with many contemporary artists incorporating photographs into their work in various ways.

Here is a simplified version of the passage, suitable for a C1 learner:

William James, an American philosopher and physician, defined psychology as the'science of mental life' in 1890. This definition still provides a good starting point for understanding psychology today. We all have a mental life, and as humans, we have some idea of what this means. However, despite being able to study psychology in animals like rats and monkeys, it remains a complex and elusive concept. James believed that human psychology consists of basic elements: thoughts, feelings, a physical world, and a way of understanding these things. For each of us, this knowledge is primarily personal and private, coming from our own thoughts, feelings, and experiences. This is why it's easy for us to make judgments about psychological matters based on our own experiences. We often act as amateur psychologists when we share our opinions on complex psychological phenomena, such as whether brainwashing works or why people behave in certain ways. However, problems arise when two ordinary people have different understandings. Formal psychology aims to provide methods for determining which explanations are most likely to be correct and under which circumstances they apply. Psychologists help us distinguish between subjective thoughts, which may be biased and unreliable, and facts. Psychology is about the mind or brain, but despite studying the brain, psychologists don't fully understand its workings. They have discovered more by studying behavior and using observations to derive hypotheses about what's happening inside us. The study of psychology is challenging because scientific facts should be objective and verifiable, but the workings of the mind are not directly observable. Psychologists have to infer what's going on inside us by observing behavior. The study of psychology is like solving a crossword puzzle, involving evaluating and interpreting clues. These clues are derived from careful observation, accurate measurement, and logical arguments that can be scrutinized publicly. Psychology aims to describe, understand, predict, and control the processes it studies. Once these goals are achieved, it can help us understand our experience and apply findings directly to people's lives. Psychological findings have been useful in fields like education, machine design, and mental health. Although psychological questions have been discussed for centuries, they have only been studied scientifically for the past 150 years. Early psychologists relied on introspection, or reflecting on their own conscious experience, to find answers. However, this method has limitations. Today, psychologists prefer to base their theories on careful observations of behavior rather than introspection.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

In a warehouse in Michigan, USA, there is a unique collection of failed consumer products. It's a museum that showcases products that didn't sell well. The owner, Carol Sherry, believes that each product has a story to tell about the designers, marketers, and salespeople who created it. What's surprising is that this museum exists as a successful business. Many companies would expect to have their own collection of failed products, but few do.

The museum's originator, Robert McMath, started collecting products in the 1960s, intending to create a reference library. However, he ended up with mostly failed products because most products fail. This might be due to the culture of optimism in business, where people often invest more money into a product to try to make it successful, even if it's not working. This approach can lead to a lack of understanding about what went wrong and a reluctance to discuss failures.

In the self-help industry, there is a focus on positive thinking and visualization. The idea is that if you imagine something going well, it's more likely to happen. However, research suggests that this approach may not be effective. In fact, studies have shown that people who are overly optimistic may actually be less motivated to achieve their goals. On the other hand, people who view failure as an opportunity to learn and improve are more likely to be successful.

Psychologist Carol Dweck suggests that our experiences of failure are influenced by our beliefs about ability. People who believe that ability is fixed may view failure as a sign of inadequacy, while those who believe that ability can be developed through effort and hard work may see failure as an opportunity to learn and improve. Dweck argues that having a growth mindset is a more positive and effective way to approach challenges and setbacks.

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a C1 learner:

Everyone knows that sports teams tend to perform better when they play at home. But why is this the case? Many of us think it's obvious, but professional sports are changing rapidly, and what we used to take for granted is no longer certain. Two factors have led to questioning the traditional explanation for home advantage: science and money. Sports scientists want to understand what makes players perform at their best, and they have come up with various theories about the impact of home advantage. Meanwhile, those who make money from sports want to know why home advantage still matters. If players are well-paid, shouldn't they feel comfortable playing anywhere?

This leaves fans wondering: would it make a difference if a team like Manchester United played some of their home games in a different location, such as the Far East, to reach their fans there? It would certainly affect the British fans, who believe that their team needs their passion and loyalty to win. This may be why fans often confuse cause and effect. They remember the times when the crowd's noise and energy led to a goal being scored, but forget the many times when the noise didn't make a difference.

One thing that does seem to be confirmed by scientific evidence is that home fans often direct their energy towards the referee. In a study, referees were shown a recording of a match with and without crowd noise. Those who heard the noise were less likely to call fouls against the home team than those who saw the game in silence. This matches what happens in real matches. The researchers concluded that referees try to avoid making decisions that would upset the home crowd.

Recent studies have looked at long-term trends in home advantage. They show that home advantage has decreased in all major sports, but not as much as you might expect. For example, in the early years of the English Football League, home teams won around 70% of the points, compared to 60% today. One reason for this may be that travel used to be more difficult, but now players are treated like stars and have many comforts. However, none of these explanations fully explain the data.

One mystery is why home advantage varies depending on the sport. Basketball is the sport where playing at home is most advantageous, followed by football. Baseball, on the other hand, is the sport where home advantage counts for the least. One possible explanation is that home advantage is more about team spirit, which is less important in individual sports like baseball. Team sports require coordination and confidence, which is boosted by playing at home. Another possibility is that the sense of territoriality and the desire to defend one's home turf is connected to a primal urge to protect one's territory, as seen in the Rugby World Cup.

Gary Player, a famous golfer, once said, ""The more I practise, the luckier I get."" However, he was being ironic, and what he really meant was, ""The more I practise, the better I get."" This quote has sparked a long-standing debate about whether talent is innate or acquired. Many experts believe that practice is more important than natural ability, citing the work of psychologist Anders Ericsson, who claims that anyone can become an expert with 10,000 hours of practice. However, some researchers argue that this theory oversimplifies the issue.

Epstein, in his book, challenges the idea that practice is the only factor that determines success. He suggests that it is often a combination of both nature and nurture that contributes to an individual's abilities. He also questions the assumption that commitment and determination can be willed, citing the example of sled dogs in Alaska, where their drive and desire seem to be influenced by their genes.

Epstein distinguishes between the role of ""hardware"" (natural ability) and ""software"" (nurture) in elite athletes. He agrees that both are important, but also highlights cases where natural ability plays a significant role. He also examines the issue of race and gender, asking why men and women are separated in athletic competitions if practice is the only factor that matters.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 level learner:

A recent report reveals that many children in wealthy countries feel unhappy and disconnected from nature. Jay Griffiths, in her book Kith, argues that this is because they spend too much time indoors, staring at screens, and have lost touch with the natural world. She believes that this is the root of the problem.

A follow-up study found that many children said they would be happier if they could spend more time outside. Many people over 40 also reminisce about their carefree childhoods, when they spent long days playing in the woods, swimming in ponds, or making dens in old sheds. They claim that this was a healthier and better way to grow up than the protected lives of today's children.

Griffiths' book also explores the relationship between the fear of danger and child-focused consumerism. She argues that parents' fear of danger drives the demand for toys and gadgets to keep their children entertained indoors. She also criticizes the trend of prescribing medication for restless children or requiring them to wear goggles for playground games.

While Griffiths makes some valid points, her arguments can be overstated. She sometimes brushes aside counterarguments and uses strong language, such as comparing modern parenting to racism. Griffiths is an idealistic romantic who sees children as naturally free-spirited and capable of managing risk. However, this is not always the case, and not all children want to take risks.

The book's central theme is the importance of giving children autonomy and allowing them to explore and take risks. Griffiths believes that children need to experience some danger to learn how to manage it. However, she does not provide guidance on how to achieve this. Moreover, not all children may want to follow the ""wild"" model that Griffiths advocates for. Some may be naturally more cautious and prefer a more structured environment.

Overall, the book raises important questions about the impact of modern parenting on children's well-being and the importance of giving them the freedom to explore and take risks.<|eot_id|>"

Here is a simplified version of the text, suitable for a learner of English at level C1:

As a research bio-psychologist, I've spent many years studying how people learn and develop. My research focuses on the importance of play for children's growth. All mammals, including humans, play when they're young, and those that have the most to learn play the most. For example, carnivores play more than herbivores because hunting is harder to learn than grazing. Children, who have the most to learn, play the most when they're allowed to do so.

Play is a natural way for adults and animals to learn and develop new skills. The most important skills children need to learn to live happy, productive, and moral lives are skills that can't be taught in school. These skills, such as thinking creatively, getting along with others, and controlling their emotions, are learned through play.

Creativity is essential for success in the modern world. We no longer need people who can only follow instructions or perform routine tasks, but we do need people who can think creatively and come up with new ideas. The ability to think creatively is closely linked to play. Many famous scientists and thinkers, such as Albert Einstein, have credited their creative work to their ability to play and think creatively.

Unfortunately, modern schooling often stifles creativity and play. Schools focus too much on teaching facts and following rules, rather than allowing children to explore and learn through play. This can lead to children becoming bored and disengaged from learning. In contrast, play is voluntary, which means that children are free to stop playing if they want to. This freedom is what makes play so democratic and empowering.

In recent years, there has been a decline in children's freedom to play. Break times have been reduced, homework has increased, and parents are often present during play, which can be stifling. This is due to a range of factors, including parents' fears, the rise of experts warning about dangers, and the decline of cohesive neighbourhoods.

To give children the best chance of developing into happy, healthy, and successful adults, we need to reverse this trend and give them more freedom to play. We need to allow them to follow their natural instincts and explore, rather than forcing them to follow a rigid curriculum. By doing so, we can help them develop the skills they need to thrive in an unpredictable world.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

Many young people in their twenties are using social media to find work. Platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn allow them to connect directly with potential employers, which was previously only possible by standing outside an office with a ""hire me"" sign. However, with greater access comes greater risk. A recent incident on LinkedIn highlights the importance of using social media professionally. A young jobseeker contacted a senior marketing executive, hoping to get job advice. The executive, however, was annoyed by the request and sent a harsh rejection message that went viral. While the tone of the message was unacceptable, it also served as a warning to young people about the dangers of using social media unprofessionally.

For many young people, social media is a natural part of their social life. They may have used platforms like Facebook and Twitter to impress, embellish, and experiment as teenagers. However, using social media for professional networking is a different story. It requires a different approach, and many young people are not aware of this.

One common mistake is being too familiar or arrogant in online communication. This can give the impression that young people are entitled, which can harm their job prospects. In reality, many young people are desperate for employment and are using social media to try to find a job.

To use social media professionally, it's essential to be clear about who you are and what you can offer. Personalize your messages and avoid sending impersonal emails. Keep the tone humble and avoid coming across as arrogant. Remember, social media can be a powerful tool for making connections, but it requires careful handling to avoid negative consequences.

Newspapers are often predicted to be on the brink of extinction, but it's hard to accurately forecast their future. Since 2000, the circulation of most UK national dailies has decreased by a third to half. In the US, the Pew Research Centre reports that newspapers are now the main source of news for only 26% of citizens, compared to 45% in 2001. Many experts claim that the last printed newspaper will be gone within 15 years. However, old media have a history of surviving. Despite predictions that books and theatre would decline, they have endured and even thrived alongside new forms of media.

Newspapers themselves were once new media, and it took centuries for them to become the dominant source of news. This was due to advances in technology, such as the steam press, railway, and telegraph, which made it possible to produce and distribute news efficiently. Additionally, the concept of needing to stay updated on current events became more widespread, especially in the 19th century.

In the past, people didn't expect change, and life was seen as cyclical, with events repeating themselves. Journalism as a profession didn't exist until the 19th century, and there was no need for regular news updates. Newspaper format and publication schedules were rigid, but online news allows for more flexibility and personalization. Readers can access news at their own pace, and corrections can be made quickly.

Despite these advantages, online news providers often prioritize being the first to break a story and generating comments over providing in-depth analysis and understanding. This can lead to confusion and misinformation. In some ways, the way we consume news is returning to the medieval era, where truth was hard to distinguish from rumor and hearsay.

Newspapers have never been excellent at explaining how the world works, and perhaps they are now facing extinction. Alternatively, they may find that they are uniquely positioned to guide us towards wisdom and understanding in a chaotic world.

Here is the simplified text, adapted for a C1 learner:

If humans were meant to live in the moon's light, we would be comfortable in the dark, just like many nocturnal animals. However, we are diurnal creatures, adapted to living in the sun's light. This is deeply ingrained in our biology, even though we don't often think about it. We've managed to control the night by filling it with artificial light. This has benefits, but also consequences, such as light pollution. Light pollution is mainly caused by poor lighting design, which sends light upwards and outwards, rather than focusing it downwards. This disrupts the natural rhythms of many living things, including humans.

For most of human history, the term ""light pollution"" would have been meaningless. Imagine walking through a moonlit London in the 1800s, when the city was much smaller and lit only by candles, torches, and lanterns. From a distance, you would have smelled the city rather than seen it.

We've lit up the night as if it were an empty space, but in reality, many nocturnal species thrive in the dark. Light is a powerful force that attracts many animals, and scientists have seen birds being drawn to searchlights and gas flares. This can have serious consequences, such as birds colliding with brightly lit buildings during migration.

It's not just astronomers who are affected by light pollution. Darkness is essential for our physical and mental well-being. Disrupting our natural rhythms can lead to physical ailments and affect our ability to sleep and wake up normally. Our bodies are adapted to the natural cycles of day and night, and messing with these rhythms is like altering our center of gravity.

In the end, we are trapped by light pollution, just like frogs near a brightly lit highway. We've cut ourselves off from our evolutionary and cultural heritage, forgetting the beauty of the stars and the rhythms of day and night. Light pollution makes us lose sight of our place in the universe, forgetting the scale of our existence, which is best measured against the vastness of a dark night with the Milky Way shining above.<|eot_id|>"

Here is the simplified text, targeted at a C1 level learner:

The founder of a large multinational company has announced that the company will no longer track employees' paid holiday time. This decision was inspired by a similar policy at an internet company. The founder claims that the idea came from an email from his daughter, but some people think this might be a way to make the policy seem more human.

The problem with this policy is that it might not be practical for a company as big and diverse as this one. The internet company has only 2,000 employees and provides a single service, whereas this company has 50,000 employees working in many different areas. It's hard to imagine how employees can know if their absence would harm the business or not.

The founder says that employees can take as much leave as they want as long as they're sure it won't damage the business or their careers. However, it's hard to be certain about this. Even if you prepare well for a holiday, there's always a lot of work to come back to. This can lead to stress and guilt, which can negatively impact productivity in the long run.

The policy could also create pressure from colleagues and gossip about who's taking time off and for how long. This can make people feel uncomfortable about taking holidays. Additionally, the culture of working late in the corporate sector might lead to a ""no holiday"" culture, where people compete for promotion.

Modern technology has blurred the line between work and leisure time, making it difficult to disconnect from work. The internet company started their unlimited leave policy because employees asked how it could be reconciled with the old time-off policy. However, this policy might lead to a situation where employees are always on call and feel like they're being monitored, which can be destructive.

Employment law exists to protect workers' well-being, and workers are entitled to a minimum amount of paid annual leave. This is important for their mental and physical health. While the policy might aim to increase morale, creativity, and productivity, I'm not convinced that it's the best way to achieve these goals.

Here is the simplified text:

Journal-based peer review is considered the gold standard for ensuring the quality of scientific research. However, it's not perfect and has its limitations. The process can be slow, with papers taking up to a year to be published after review. Some argue that this delay is worth it to ensure the trustworthiness of the published literature. Others believe that the current system is flawed and that preprints, or draft papers posted online without peer review, could be a better way forward.

Preprints have been around for 20 years, but their adoption has been slow. One reason is that scientists are conservative and prefer the traditional system. Another reason is that many believe that journals won't accept manuscripts that have been posted online as preprints. There's also a fear that preprints could lead to the spread of ""junk science"", but so far, this hasn't happened.

In reality, preprints are not peer-reviewed, but they are immediately open to critique and discussion by a global community of reviewers. This can be beneficial, as it allows for a more open and transparent discussion of research. For example, a psychology professor recently posted a critique of a published paper as a preprint and received feedback from the original authors and other experts. This led to a more constructive discussion and a better understanding of the research.

Preprints could also help to address the issue of negative results, which are often overlooked in the traditional publishing process. By making preprints more accessible, we can increase the dissemination of research and encourage a more collaborative approach to science. By harnessing the power of the internet and recalling the collaborative ethos of the scientific community, preprints could help to refocus attention on the research itself, rather than where it is published.<|eot_id|>"

When I ask my students to define a poem, they often say it's a ""painting in words."" I'm not satisfied with this answer, nor are they. One day, I asked them to describe an object in two ways: scientifically, like a scientist would, and from the perspective of the object itself. One student wrote a poem about an oxygen mask, which helped us understand how poetry works in a unique way. The exercise led to a fun and productive discussion.

I used to find poetry confusing and unnecessary in school. I saw it as a puzzle that got in the way of understanding and feeling. After school, poetry isn't something that grabs people's attention as much. Occasionally, you'll come across a poem that stands out, but it's often disappointing or hard to understand. People usually look for poems that express deep emotions, vivid images, or clever ideas. But what do we really hope to find in a poem?

A poem can be many things, but one of its unique qualities is its ability to be ambiguous. Our daily lives are full of ambiguity, and poetry can capture that. However, this doesn't tell us what a poem is. The word ""poem"" comes from the Greek word ""poíema,"" which means ""thing made."" So, what kind of thing is a poem?

Poets often compare poems to wild animals or machines, but these comparisons don't work. Instead, trying to define a poem through comparison can change our understanding of what a machine or wild animal is. It can also help us see everyday things in a new light.

The idea of a poem as a mental object is not hard to grasp, especially when we think about how song lyrics can get stuck in our heads. The combination of words and music has a powerful effect. A poem on a page can be powerful, even if it's just words on paper. It can have a bigger impact than prose, even though it's not doing anything different. The white space around a poem can make it stand out, even if it could have been used for something else.

A poem is a product of writing and rewriting, like an article or novel, but it's not created to be a commodity. It's not meant to be sold or bought. Because of its special status, a poem can still surprise us, even if only for a moment.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

I bought my first metal detector soon after I got married. It was a significant expense, but my wife, Marion, was impressed when I found a gold ring worth £80 on my first outing. Over the years, every brooch and coin I've discovered has given me a sense of satisfaction, connecting me to the past. However, it wasn't until 40 years later that I made another discovery that impressed Marion as much as the gold ring. On a rainy February afternoon, I decided to search a spot I knew contained old farming equipment. The detector beeped twice, and I couldn't ignore it. After digging, I found a golden ball, which turned out to be a beautifully patterned loop. As I brushed away more dirt, I realized it was similar to the Great Torc, an ancient necklace on display at the British Museum. I took it home, and Marion was amazed when I showed it to her. We decided not to try it on, as it was too valuable. I hid it in our wardrobe, but eventually, I got anxious and hid it under a floorboard in my office. The law requires that such finds be reported to the authorities within 14 days, so I eventually took it to the council office. The torc was authenticated and sold to the local council for £350,000. The money was split between the field owner and me. Although the torc was a significant find, it's not just about the money. It's something I've preserved for the nation. People often ask me if I'll stop detecting now, but I won't. Just like a fisherman doesn't stop fishing after catching a big fish, I'll keep searching for more treasures.

Sleep is one of my favorite things to do while traveling. However, I don't usually talk about it because I feel a bit guilty. When my friends share stories about their busy trips, filled with planned activities, I smile and don't say much. I prefer to spend my time sleeping in the afternoon under the Caribbean rain or snuggled up in Italian sheets. Traveling can be tiring, and sleep is a wonderful side effect. When I visited the Yucatán coast in Mexico, I was surprised to find I slept for more than 12 hours a day. The noise from the birds outside didn't bother me, and I felt more relaxed than I expected.

I think sleep is an extension of our travels, not just a break from them. When we travel, we experience new sights, sounds, and smells, and this can be overwhelming. Sleep is when our brains process all this new information. That's why sleep can be so intense while traveling. Sleep also changes rhythm from place to place. People often struggle with jet lag, but I think it's more about adjusting to local customs and routines. For example, on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, people wake up early, take a nap at 10 am, and then come back to life in the evening. It takes me a few days to get used to this rhythm, but when I do, I feel like I've really arrived.

I remember a day in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, when I had a big lunch with friends and then took a nap on the couch with them. It was a typical Dominican siesta, and I felt like I was experiencing a part of their culture. Travel sleep has another great benefit: it's something I remember vividly. When I'm sleeping in a new place, my brain fills with the sights, sounds, and smells of that place. If slow travel is about taking your time and enjoying every experience, then sleep is the ultimate slow travel activity. Maybe I should stop feeling guilty and tell my friends that sleep is an important part of my travel routine.<|eot_id|>"

He's now on the verge of a new adventure in American football, despite having never played the sport before. Lawrence is still figuring out his new position, but he's likely to be selected for one of the top NFL teams. This is an astonishing turn of events, especially considering his background in rugby and athletics.

Lawrence had originally traveled to Atlanta for discus training, but he decided to try out American football after arriving in the US. He applied for the NFL trials in Atlanta, despite having no experience in the sport. When asked if he was nervous about competing against seasoned American football players, Lawrence replied, ""Not at all. I don't get nervous for many things.""

Lawrence's impressive performance in the trials caught the attention of coaches, who praised his skills and attributes. He's now waiting to hear if he's been selected for an NFL team. Despite the excitement, Lawrence remains calm, saying he's not too bothered about the outcome.

Lawrence's journey from discus to American football is remarkable, and some might wonder why he's not focusing on one sport. Lawrence believes his decisions have been calculated, and if American football doesn't work out, he can always return to discus, the sport he loves. With a minimum salary of over $400,000 a year, the economic incentives are clear. Lawrence is following his dreams, and if that means trying out a new sport, so be it.

We had been flying east for many hours and I woke up to see that it was already daytime. I looked out the window and saw a vast, empty landscape below. The colors were a mix of brown and green, which reassured me that it was still early September and the harsh Siberian winter had not yet begun. I couldn't see any signs of human life, just a vast expanse of mountains, streams, and forests stretching out to the horizon. I shook my head. My neighbor, Sergei, a salesman from Moscow, woke up and smiled at me sleepily. 'Good morning, Robert,' he said, pronouncing my name in a slow Russian accent. He was on his way to the remote mining areas of Siberia to sell safety equipment. My Russian was limited, but I managed to explain to him that I was heading to the city of Magadan in eastern Siberia with only a one-way ticket. I planned to return home to England by bicycle. 'But, Robert, there's no road from Magadan,' he said. 'You can't ride a bicycle.' I explained that I believed there was a road, even if it was not well-used. 'Alone?' he asked, pointing at me. 'No, I'll be riding with a friend called Al.' Sergei looked unconvinced, so I tried to reassure him that I had warm clothes and would be fine. I didn't mention that I was on a tight budget and had bought most of my gear at discounted prices. The idea had started when I was a student in Scotland. I was sitting in a lecture hall, feeling restless, when I wrote a note to my friend Al: 'Do you want to cycle across the Karakorum Highway between Pakistan and China this summer? Rob.'

In the Red Bull Air Race, 12 pilots fly through a series of 15-25 meter high pylons at speeds of up to 370 km per hour. I had the opportunity to experience it firsthand. Before the flight, I had to sign two forms: one confirming my good health and the other emptying my pockets, as small objects can be dangerous during the flight. I also learned that I had to stay oriented throughout the flight and relax when flying upside down. 

An hour before the flight, I received a safety briefing, where I was told not to touch anything under any circumstances. As we taxied down the runway, I was asked to keep my legs up and hands away from the controls. I was nervous, but Dario, the pilot, reassured me that I would be fine.

As we took off and banked sharply to the right, I felt the air rush out of my lungs. We then levelled out and made a sharp left turn, diving down to 2,000 meters. After that, we flew low over the ground, aiming for a narrow space between two pylons. I was excited, but also a bit scared.

For two minutes, I got to fly the plane, and it was incredibly responsive. Then Dario asked me if I was okay, and instead of answering, he did a barrel roll. I was a bit overwhelmed, but I tried to stay calm. After the flight, Dario did some more acrobatic stunts, including a loop. I was relieved when it was over and we landed.

Although some people might find this experience exciting, I just found it a bit too intense. As we landed, Dario pulled out some sandwiches and started eating. I didn't feel like eating for hours, and that night, I had a vivid dream about flying in loops.<|eot_id|>"

Doug Allan is a wildlife cameraman who has filmed many amazing animal scenes in cold places. If you've ever seen polar bears in a nature documentary, it's probably his work. He loves the cold and has spent a lot of time in places like Antarctica and the Arctic. Allan used to be a marine biologist and commercial diver, which helped him learn how to survive in cold conditions.

His big break came when a TV crew came to Antarctica to film a wildlife documentary, and he ended up taking them to different locations. He realized that being a wildlife cameraman was the perfect job for him, combining travel, adventure, and underwater filming.

Allan has worked on many major TV wildlife series and has become known as the ""cold man"" because of his expertise in filming in cold climates. When he started out 35 years ago, filming technology was very basic, and he had to remember every shot he took. Now, with digital technology, he can shoot a lot of footage and review it immediately.

Allan's experience in filming in cold conditions is valuable, and he has a feel for it. He has spent so much time on sea ice that it's become second nature to him. He's had some great successes, but also some failures and embarrassing moments, like when he couldn't identify a type of bird in the Orkneys.

Recently, Allan went to Kong Karls Land, a group of islands in the Arctic Ocean, to film polar bears. It was a challenging assignment, with temperatures often below -32°C and strong winds. After 23 days of filming, he finally saw a mother bear and her cub, and then, on the 24th day, he was surrounded by polar bears. He described the experience as being in ""bear world,"" where he had to move quietly and carefully to avoid startling them.

Allan is now planning to make a documentary about climate change in the Arctic, talking to the people who live there and experiencing the impact of climate change firsthand. He believes he can make an extraordinary documentary.<|eot_id|>"

In 2004, Pen Hadow became the first person to trek to the North Pole alone and without any supplies. This was an incredible achievement, considering he had to swim through icy waters, fight frostbite, and protect himself from polar bears. Just eight months later, he reached the South Pole as well. Now, he is preparing for an even more ambitious expedition.

Pen is an explorer who is driven by a sense of adventure. He has to be, as the challenges he faces are enormous. This time, he will be joined by two colleagues on a three-month, 1,000-kilometre trek to the North Pole. They will collect data on the thickness and density of the ice, which has never been done before. The results will be crucial for scientists studying global warming.

Pen's love of adventure began when he was a child. His father's old nanny, who had worked for a famous explorer, would take him on expeditions in the Scottish mountains, even in harsh weather conditions. This toughened him up and developed his physical endurance. Pen is married to Mary, a horsewoman who shares his love of the outdoors. She helps him with his polar guide business and is worried about his safety, even when he's at home.

Pen is also a father of two children. He admits that it's harder to be away from them this time, especially since he made a mistake last time by giving his son too much responsibility. He's planning to keep in touch with them as little as possible during his expedition to avoid reminding them of his distance.

Pen is preparing his equipment obsessively, knowing that he won't have much time to fix things once he's on the ice. He'll be accompanied by two experienced colleagues and a team of six who will provide supplies. Despite the challenges, Pen believes that his mission is important, as it will help scientists understand the impact of global warming on the Arctic region. He hopes that his expedition will inspire others to take action and engage with the issue.

Here is the simplified text:

After retiring from professional sports, I took a break and considered what I wanted to do next. As a successful athlete, I had the opportunity to do more writing, TV work, and speaking engagements. While I enjoyed this variety, I missed the thrill of competition and the feeling of being part of a team. I decided to stay in shape by entering marathons and triathlons, just in case I wanted to return to competitive sports in the future.

Ben Fogle, a TV presenter, asked me to join him on a rowing trip across the Atlantic Ocean. I had always loved rowing and missed the feeling of gliding across the water. I talked to some of my rowing friends, but they weren't interested in joining the trip. I considered the pros and cons of joining Ben on the adventure. On one hand, I would have no pressure to win, but on the other hand, I would want to win and felt that Ben's lack of rowing experience might put us at a disadvantage.

We discussed the costs of the trip, which were significant, and the potential loss of income from speaking engagements. I decided to join Ben on the trip, not just for the adventure, but also because it would give me a new goal to work towards and a chance to earn money by speaking about my experience.

As we prepared for the trip, I realized that Ben's lack of rowing experience was a major concern. He had completed other challenging adventures, but rowing was not his strong suit. I tried to be patient, but it was clear that he needed to improve significantly. In hindsight, I should have been more realistic about his abilities when I agreed to join him on the trip.

The Atlantic Rowing Race is not just about physical strength, but also mental toughness. I was surprised by how much I had to teach Ben about rowing, and he was surprised by my lack of sympathy for his struggles. In the end, I learned to appreciate the value of patience and understanding in a team effort.<|eot_id|>"

About a year ago, I left my job to work with huskies in the Arctic Circle in northern Finland. I was 26 and felt restless, so I decided to join a small company that offers husky dog sledding tours in the winter. The company, run by Anna and Pasi, has over 100 huskies and takes tourists on rides across the ice and snow. I joined the team for three months, despite being warned that the work would be physically demanding and the conditions harsh.

As I prepared to leave, I was given a list of over 100 husky names to memorize. But when I got on the plane, I was too distracted to focus. I looked out the window instead, watching the winter landscape unfold. When I arrived at the farm, I was handed a pair of boots and told to get to work. The huskies were excited and barking loudly, and I had to be thrown into the action quickly.

It didn't take long to learn the basics of dog sledding, but I struggled with more complex tasks like feeding and watering the dogs in sub-zero temperatures. We had to make a special ""soup"" for the dogs using hot water and meat, as the regular water would freeze solid. By the end of my first week, I was exhausted and my muscles ached, but I was proud of myself for learning new skills like chopping wood and using a circular saw in the snow.

On that day, Paula Radcliffe finished her marathon in an incredible time. The press gathered to understand her amazing achievement. They were surprised to learn that her time was good enough to qualify her for the men's marathon at the world championships in Paris. Journalists asked her about a special treatment she used, emu oil, which had been recommended by Olympic gold medallist Cathy Freeman to help her recover from an injury. Radcliffe said that her achievement didn't really sink in at the time. She just felt like she was doing what she was supposed to do, and it came naturally to her.

Radcliffe's coach and husband, Gary Lough, was listening to the race on the radio with her physiotherapist, Gerard Hartmann. Hartmann was worried that Radcliffe was going too fast, but Radcliffe was determined to push herself. With 800m left to go, she realized she could finish in under 2 hours 16 minutes if she could cross the line in under 3 minutes. She finished in 2 hours 17 minutes and 42 seconds, which was an incredible feat.

After the race, everyone was curious about how Radcliffe, who had an unusual running style, was able to beat the East African runners. Hartmann said that Radcliffe was an exceptional athlete who could take a lot of pain. He worked with her for weeks at a time, providing daily sessions to help her recover from her training. Hartmann said that Radcliffe was so dedicated to her training that she would often wear him out, forcing him to go deep into her muscles to help her recover.

Radcliffe's determination and hard work paid off, and she left a lasting legacy in the world of long-distance running. Many women were inspired to take up running after seeing her achievements.

Here is the simplified text for a C1 learner:

When my first cooking show, In Search of Perfection, was released, I was worried about how people would react. I had created a unique approach to cooking that combined techniques, history, and science, but I wasn't sure if it would resonate with viewers. As the show's success grew, it paved the way for other exciting projects, including a book based on my experiences at my restaurant.

In each project, there's a sense of exploration, whether it's delving into the past, exploring the human mind, or mastering cooking techniques. I wrote several books in the 'Perfection' series, each accompanying its own TV show. These books took me on physical journeys around the world, meeting extraordinary people who had spent decades pursuing their own ideas of perfection.

Perfection is subjective, and even choosing which dishes to include in the series was a challenge. I knew I'd disappoint some people by leaving out their favorite dishes. However, after careful consideration, my team and I came up with a list that catered to everyone's tastes.

This reinforced my belief that each person has their own unique idea of perfection, shaped by personal experiences, emotions, and surroundings. In my book, I didn't aim to provide definitive recipes, but rather to explore the underlying factors that make certain dishes work. The TV series allowed me to discover new foods, people, and places, which I was excited about, as it reminded me of how I started my career by searching for the best ingredients.

My journey took me to various locations, including a canning factory that turned out to be processing the wrong type of tomato, and a dairy farm that fell short of my expectations. To refine each recipe, I experimented with different techniques, such as hand-milking a cow and using dry ice to make ice cream, cooking chicken breasts in a hospital scanning machine, and even trying to cook a Neapolitan-style pizza in my own oven.

I made some minor changes to the original text to make it more accessible to a C1 learner, including:

We were still far from Marrakech when our van broke down in a field. John got out to take a look at the engine, but he didn't seem to know what was wrong. 'To be honest, I have no idea what I'm doing,' he said with a laugh. My sister Bea was worried, 'We can't stay here forever.' The field was empty, just grass and flowers. 'We can't stay here forever,' I repeated, trying to agree with Bea. We got back into the van and waited for John to stop laughing. Mum stretched out on the grass and asked us to tell her a story. I told them about two birds I had heard talking in London before we left. I told them about the things they had talked about, like breadcrumbs and the weather. But when Bea said it was silly, I started to doubt myself. I wasn't sure if I really remembered the conversation or just imagined it. Mum had fallen asleep, and John had gone to find some help. He came back with three Moroccan boys who helped us push the van to a nearby hotel. We decided to have some tea and wait for John to fix the van. The tea was very sweet, made from mint leaves. We stayed at the hotel all day while John worked on the van. When it got dark, John said it was a miracle it had made it that far. We slept in the hotel garden that night. The next day, John arranged for our van to be towed into Marrakech. I was worried about how we would get back home, but I must have fallen asleep soon after.

* Changed some phrases to make them more concise, such as ""We stayed at the café all day"" instead of ""We sat on the side of the road and watched John grow smaller and smaller as he went off in search of someone who knew something about cars""

Lucy was talking to two other pianists at the welcome party in the hotel ballroom. They were both older than her and came from Tokyo and a European city. They talked about the music they were playing, their travels, and their future plans. Lucy mentioned that she was going to Tanglewood, which sounded impressive. However, she didn't really want to go there. She had been traveling a lot for concerts and competitions, which made her miss a lot of school. She was no longer officially enrolled and worked with tutors from the University of San Francisco instead.

Lucy hadn't even applied for the Prague Festival, but her mother had submitted her application without asking her. Lucy felt that her mother had done this to avoid disappointing her if she didn't get in. The pianist from Tokyo asked Lucy how old she was, and she replied that she was 15. The other pianist, Liesel/Louisa, was surprised and asked Lucy to explain that Tanglewood was part of a new youth-spotlight initiative. Lucy's grandfather then interrupted their conversation and pulled her away, warning her not to get too friendly with the other pianists. He took her around the room, introducing her to important people and making her talk to them. In the elevator, he told Lucy that she did well and was proud of her. He said that everyone knew who she was and that there was a buzz about her.

'It's not good for you to spend too much time online. You need to get out into the real world,' my dad said. But I decided to find out what experts think. Research shows that most teenagers who use social media have many real-life friends, a good sense of who they are, and are learning important technical skills. Simon Miles, an e-safety expert, says that social networking is a natural part of modern childhood. Teenagers don't just use social media occasionally, like adults do; they live it. It's not good or bad - it's what you do with it that matters.

Jim Matthews, a social media analyst, says that social networking is like hanging out at the youth club, where you share jokes and gossip with friends. It helps teenagers develop their sense of identity and learn to deal with their peers. A psychologist, Professor Keith Davidson, says that social networking can help you figure out who you are and what you like. You can post about your favorite music or sports, and see what others think. Research shows that people who use social media a lot are not as self-absorbed as those who don't.

Professor Andrew Phillips says that social networking can be especially helpful for shy people or those with special interests. They can connect with others who share their interests online. Pauline White, a digital education expert, says that social networking is becoming a creative force. Teenagers are making videos, podcasts, and blogs about the things they're interested in. They're even creating their own content and sharing it with others. This can be very beneficial when they enter the workforce.

In the future, every business will use social media to sell and promote their brand. Employers want people who understand how to use social media and can create customers. For example, if you have 1000 friends on different social networks, they're all potential customers for your product. If you connect all those networks together, you have a customer base. Teenagers who use social media creatively will have an advantage when they enter the workforce.<|eot_id|>"

When most people think of a relaxing family vacation, they might not immediately think of a road trip across nine US states and one Canadian province. But my parents had other plans for our summer vacation this year. They decided to plan a trip that would be an adventure for my twin brother and me, the modern teenager's worst nightmare. ""Not many people do this anymore,"" they kept saying, which made my brother and me exchange worried glances. We were excited, but also a bit apprehensive about the next two weeks without our own space.

We packed our car with suitcases, coolers, and a mix of clothing for all kinds of weather. Although I was thrilled, I was also looking forward to some quiet time, which I had already thought of a few ways to achieve. With barely enough room left in the car, we set off on our ""Family Great American Road Trip."" As we left our comfortable home behind, we wondered what we were getting ourselves into.

We headed west, driving through the Oklahoma panhandle. We had some exciting experiences, like almost getting blown off the road in a dust storm and learning that cows have the right of way. We stopped for the night in a town with the darkest skies in the country and continued the next day, sensing a pattern forming. The desert gave way to mountains, and each day blended together, but each adventure was unique.

We explored the Great Sand Dunes, visited Pagosa Springs, Colorado, and experienced the smell of sulfur in that friendly town. We also learned that some roads are better left to four-wheel-drive vehicles. We saw a mix of old and new everywhere we went, and dodging construction traffic became routine. We laughed when we found ""CLOSED"" signs at the Four Corners Monument, and we enjoyed watching the sunset over bear habitats in Yellowstone National Park. We even had a close encounter with a bear and a park ranger.

As we continued our journey, life back home faded away, and even the creaky, rustic hotel we stayed in couldn't dampen our spirits. The hotel had no internet or cell phone service, but in exchange, we got to enjoy breathtaking views. After watching a rainstorm from our cozy hotel room in Canada, we headed back south. My parents were right – you don't need to travel to a foreign country to have an amazing experience. It was bittersweet to be back home, but at least we didn't fight the whole time. I have over 3,000 photos to look through and remember the unplanned moments that made our trip so special.<|eot_id|>"

Rose Frost was 16 years old and was going to live with her grandmother, Daisy, for a while. Her parents were separating, and her father was going to work abroad for two years. Her mother and sister Amy would stay in England, but Rose was going to live with her grandmother. Amy was finishing her final school year, so it would be better for her to stay at the college with the Head as her guardian.

Rose's grandmother, Daisy, was a lively and social person who loved to host dinner parties and go out. Rose had happy memories of visiting her grandmother when she was younger, but she had never known her grandfather. When Daisy offered Rose a place to stay, her parents were hesitant, but Daisy insisted it would be no trouble.

Rose was excited to live with her grandmother and have more independence. She wanted to be able to play music loudly, invite friends over, and go out without needing permission. Her parents agreed, and Rose's mother gave her a new mobile phone with a video camera for emergencies. They all agreed to trust each other and communicate openly.

Rose had never been a troublemaker and had always been responsible. She was looking forward to starting at a new school in a few weeks and making new friends.

Charlotte Grainger's primary school teacher first suggested that she might write a novel. Charlotte thought it was a challenging task, and she didn't know what other teenagers were doing, like competing in the Olympics. At 13, she decided to give it a try. Her novel, which she started then, is now being published.

Charlotte recently told her former teacher about her book, and the teacher was surprised. She thought Charlotte would wait until she was 30 or 40 to publish a novel. Charlotte couldn't understand why she would put off something she was good at.

I met Charlotte in her publisher's office. Her book is impressive, with a strong narrative and plenty of action. It's hard to believe it was written by a 15-year-old. Charlotte's publicist was present, but she didn't need any support. Charlotte is a confident and intelligent person who is aware of her youth. When I asked her about the complex moral issues in her book, she said she was trying to ask big questions, not answer them.

Charlotte believes that teenagers are often portrayed in a negative light in fiction. She thinks there are three types of teenagers in novels: the outsider who becomes accepted, the naive one who knows nothing, and the awkward one who is not socially skilled. She was frustrated with these stereotypes and wanted to write about a character who is fine, without any flaws. Charlotte thinks that some writers undermine teenagers' self-belief by portraying them as not knowing who they are because they are not experienced enough.

Charlotte is a keen reader of fantasy novels, but some of them made her doubt her ability to write a good book. However, she was influenced by a book called How Not to Write a Novel, which advised that if readers can guess what's going to happen, the suspense is lost. Charlotte's parents, both journalists, helped her get her book published. Her father's acquaintance with someone in publishing got her book read initially. Charlotte acknowledges her good fortune, but she emphasizes that writers need both support and talent to succeed.

As we stood at the top of the ski slope, our instructor Gareth reminded us, ""Speed is your friend, not your enemy."" He asked who wanted to go first, and David, who had experience with freestyle ski-jumping, volunteered. However, his attempt didn't go well. He hit the jump too fast, lost his skis, and fell head-first into the snow. Gareth warned us that speed can be unpredictable.

I had always enjoyed skiing, but I wasn't sure about freestyle skiing. I had never tried it before and wasn't confident. My parents had booked a freestyle skiing course for us at a training centre in the US, which had an indoor facility with trampolines and artificial snow. Students would practice their moves on the trampolines and then try them on the real slopes.

Gareth explained that the centre's slogan, ""Progression is inevitable,"" meant that with practice, we would get better. He also warned us about the importance of speed and control when jumping. The ""knuckle"" refers to the flat section behind the jump, and landing on it can be painful. To avoid this, we needed to maintain speed and control.

It wasn't easy for me to overcome my fear and speed up. My legs would freeze up as I approached the jump, and I would end up landing on the knuckle. By the end of the day, I was exhausted and sore. Gareth encouraged us to control the jump, not let it control us.

The next day, we started with trampoline exercises to improve our aerial awareness. We practiced moves similar to those we would do while ski-jumping, as well as exercises to help us understand our body position while in the air. Gareth provided feedback and guidance. I struggled at first, but eventually, I started to get the hang of it.

We returned to the mountain to try again, and it took some time and practice, but I finally landed properly. Gareth was proud of me, and I felt a sense of accomplishment. However, my celebration was short-lived, as I soon realized that I had lost my skis on the final run of the day.<|eot_id|>"

Imagine you're on a rollercoaster at an amusement park. Your palms are sweaty with fear, and you're holding on tight as the ride comes to a stop and then starts moving slowly upwards. Then, it drops suddenly, and your stomach is in the air. You're scared, but you only have yourself to blame because you chose to ride it. Rollercoasters are a huge business, with many people visiting them every year. Behind the scenes, there are teams of experts who design and build the rides. They are structural, mechanical, industrial, and electrical engineers, as well as designers and marketing experts. It's a challenging job, as they need to create a balance between thrill and safety. They also need to make sure the ride is exciting and new, but not too intense.

I spoke to three experts in the field. Professor Brendan Walker, a thrill engineer, said that the key is to combine different elements to create a thrilling experience. Dr. John Roberts, a fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, agreed, saying that the goal is to create a sense of excitement and safety at the same time. The teams behind rollercoasters need to create a narrative, or story, that works with the ride's features, such as steep drops and sharp turns. Professor Walker also emphasized the importance of gut instincts, experience, and trial-and-error in designing rollercoasters.

I asked them if they thought rollercoaster designers would need to adapt to new technology, such as virtual reality. Professor Walker said that while new technology can add to the ride experience, the physical coaster experience will remain the most important part for many years to come.<|eot_id|>"

I once had a conversation with a friend about why I travel when I can watch amazing things on TV. I agreed that TV is great, but why stay at home when there's so much to experience in the world? This conversation inspired me to plan a unique four-day trip and a film to encourage people to put down their remotes. A friend was getting rid of his old sofa, which became the star of the film. I fixed the sofa's wheels and connected it to old seatbelts, which I wore on my shoulders. I carried my luggage on the seats and slept on the sofa each night, including one night on the beach. Some friends joined me on the journey, helping me pull the sofa along and encouraging me to keep going. This was a new experience for me, as I've been on several walking expeditions before but never on a sofa. Not only was it the longest distance I've ever walked, but it was also on main roads, which allowed me to stop at cafes and relax on the sofa with a coffee. When people ask me about my weekend, I prefer to tell them about my sofa adventure rather than the latest TV show. You can watch the film on my website.

I was thrilled when I read about guided swimming trips around small Greek islands. I'd never joined a group tour before, so I decided to give it a try. Since my brother was busy, I thought it would be a good opportunity to meet new people. The man at the Greek port looked surprised when I asked for a single ferry ticket, as the islands are usually popular with families. I reassured him that I wouldn't be alone for long, as I'd be joining a group of ten people for the swim. Although he still looked puzzled, he showed me to my seat on the ferry with a smile.

Before we set off, our group had exchanged emails, but there wasn't much time to chat before our first group swim. Our guides explained that a support boat would accompany us throughout the trip and taught us how to communicate with it. We did a short swim to split into speed groups, and then it was time for our first 1.5 km swim. I was a bit nervous, as I'd only swum in my local pool and a river before, but never in the open sea. As the waves got bigger, I found myself at the back of the slow group, which wasn't where I'd hoped to be. I watched the faster swimmers ahead of me, and I was determined to complete the distance on my own. When I finally finished, I was thrilled.

The following days followed a routine: we'd jump into the water, find a comfortable pace, and then stop to admire the scenery. As the swims got longer, I got faster and more confident, and I didn't need the support boat as much. I'm already looking forward to coming back next year.<|eot_id|>"

At the summer camp where I work, I love seeing children achieve things they thought were impossible. Most kids know how to swim and play table tennis before they arrive, but rock climbing is a new experience for many of them. Some children are initially nervous, but after encouragement, they all manage to reach the top. This gives them a great sense of accomplishment.

Some children miss their homes at the beginning of the week, but it's mainly the 10-13-year-olds who feel this way. We don't let them use their phones constantly. We tell them they can call home after lunch, and later, after dinner, we say it's too late to call now, try again tomorrow. Most children adjust quickly, and by the end of their stay, they all thank us for a great time.

It's not just the children who feel homesick. We also get parents who call constantly, asking about their child's progress. This is often unnecessary, as their child might be busy playing or doing something else. We have to remind parents to call back later. We also get children who come dressed in fancy new clothes, but they usually understand why we ask them to change into something more suitable.

Rock the Planet, a musical show that combines acting and music, opened in London after five years in the United States, where it won 'Best Musical' four times. The show's creators faced a challenge when they decided to use an all-British cast, as the UK has stricter rules about how many performances young actors can do each week. As a result, they needed twice as many actors as they did in the US. Luckily, the director found plenty of talented UK-based actors, and the show has just won its first 'Best Musical' award in the UK.

Despite the larger theatre in London, the show has been sold out every night, with audiences eager to hear the songs that became popular in America. I met 11-year-old Jamie, one of the young actors, who told me about his experience. 'I love that I get to play music for a living, especially on my beautiful Gibson guitar,' he said. He explained that the young actors have a busy schedule, with school lessons during the day at the theatre, but he misses his old school friends.

When I asked him about the show, Jamie said that his whole class came to see it, thanks to special ticket deals for schools. They loved it, and that made him feel proud. His parents come to see the show when they can, but it's expensive for them. I also play guitar, so Jamie lent me his spare guitar and we played a song together. I was impressed by his skills and happy to keep up. The young actors are all musicians, but none of them had played in a band before. They found it easy to learn, but the hardest part was looking natural when they first performed together - they were concentrating so much that they forgot to smile!

The show will be in London for another year, and I highly recommend it.<|eot_id|>"
